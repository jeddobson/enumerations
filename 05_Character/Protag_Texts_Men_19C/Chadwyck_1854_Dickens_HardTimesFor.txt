What would Mr. Bounderby say ? '' 
`` What , '' he repeated presently , `` would Mr. Bounderby say ! '' 
All the way to Stone Lodge , as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home , he repeated at intervals `` What would Mr. Bounderby say ! '' 
-- as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy . 
Not being Mrs. Grundy , who was Mr. Bounderby ? 
Why , Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind 's bosom friend , as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment . 
So near was Mr. Bounderby -- or , if the reader should prefer it , so far off . 
He was a rich man : banker , merchant , manufacturer , and what not . 
A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend , Mr. Bounderby looked older ; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again , without surprising anybody . 
He had not much hair . 
One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness . 
In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge , standing on the bearth-rug , warming himself before the fire , Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his birthday . 
He stood before the fire , partly because it was a cool spring afternoon , though the sun shone ; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar ; partly because he thus took up a commanding position , from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind . 
A foot of water in it , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
I was born with inflammation of the lungs , and of everything else , I believe , that was capable of inflammation , '' returned Mr. Bounderby . 
`` How I fought through it , I do ` nt know , '' said Bounderby . 
Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother -- `` My mother ? 
said Bounderby . 
`` My mother left me to my grandmother , '' said Bounderby : `` and , according to the best of my remembrance , my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived . 
`` She kept a chandler 's shop , '' pursued Bounderby , `` and kept me in an egg-box . 
His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest , was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast . 
Being heated when he arrived at this climax , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped . 
His eminently practical friend , on seeing him , stopped also , and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said , `` Behold your Bounderby ! '' 
blustered Mr. Bounderby , `` what 's the matter ? 
He spoke of young Thomas , but he looked at Louisa . 
The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby , was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again , without collision between herself and any other fact . 
`` Bounderby , '' said Mr. Gradgrind , drawing a chair to the fireside , `` you are always so interested in my young people -- particularly in Louisa -- that I make no apology for saying to you , I am very much vexed by this discovery . 
And yet , Bounderby , it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day , though in itself a trifling one , as if something had crept into Thomas 's and Louisa 's minds which is -- or rather , which is not -- I do n't know that I can express myself better than by saying -- which has never been intended to be developed , and in which their reason has no part . '' 
`` There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds , '' returned Bounderby . 
`` Then comes the question , '' said the eminently practical father , with his eyes on the fire , `` in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise ? '' 
`` In idle imagination , Gradgrind , '' repeated Bounderby . 
cried Bounderby , who all this time had been standing , as before , on the hearth , bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility . 
cried Bounderby again . 
She specially applied here at the house to be admitted , as not regularly belonging to our town , and -- yes , you are right , Bounderby , you are right . '' 
cried Bounderby , once more , `` Louisa saw her when she came ? '' 
`` Pray , Mrs. Gradgrind , '' said Bounderby , `` what passed ? '' 
said Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Do it at once , '' said Bounderby , `` has always been my motto from a child . 
asked his friend . 
`` Not the least in the world , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` as long as you do it at once ! '' 
So , Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat -- he always threw it on , as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself , to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat -- and with his hands in his pockets , sauntered out into the hall . 
`` I never wear gloves , '' it was his custom to say . 
`` It 's all right now , Louisa ; it 's all right , young Thomas , '' said Mr. Bounderby ; `` you wo n't do so any more . 
`` You can take one , Mr. Bounderby , '' returned Louisa , when she had coldly paused , and slowly walked across the room , and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him , with her face turned away . 
said Mr. Bounderby . 
He went his way , but she stood on the same spot , rubbing the cheek he had kissed , with her handkerchief , until it was burning red . 
Coketown , to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked , was a triumph of fact ; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself . 
Then , came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby , the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown , and both eminently practical , who could , on occasion , furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience , and illustrated by cases they had known and seen , from which it clearly appeared -- in short it was the only clear thing in the case -- that these same people were a bad lot altogether , gentlemen ; that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it , gentlemen ; that they were restless , gentlemen ; that they never knew what they wanted ; that they lived upon the best , and bought fresh butter , and insisted on Mocha coffee , and rejected all but prime parts of meat , and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable . 
`` Which is it , Bounderby ? '' 
Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town , but knew no more respecting it . 
Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby with this . 
`` Her calling seems to be pretty well known among 'em , '' observed Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Truly , I think so , '' returned his friend . 
`` Gin , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
cried Mr. Bounderby . 
Then , said Mr. Bounderby , with a loud , short laugh , `` what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for ? '' 
`` Serve 'em right , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` for being idle . '' 
She glanced up at his face , with mingled astonishment and dread . 
said Mr. Bounderby , `` when I was four or five years younger than you , I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils , twenty oils , forty oils , would have rubbed off . 
Mr. Gradgrind , though hard enough , was by no means so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby . 
His character was not unkind , all things considered ; it might have been a very kind one indeed , if he had only made some round mistake in the arithmetic that balanced it , years ago . 
He said , in what he meant for a re-assuring tone , as they turned down a narrow road , `` And this is Pod 's End ; is it , Jupe ? '' 
said Mr. Bounderby , entering last with his metallic laugh . 
As it had grown too dusky without , to see the sign , and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture , Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these idealities . 
Before Mr. Bounderby could reply , a young man appeared at the door , and introducing himself with the words , `` By your leaves , gentlemen ! '' 
walked in with his hands in his pockets . 
His face , close-shaven , thin , and sallow , was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair brushed into a roll all round his head , and parted up the centre . 
His legs were very robust , but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been . 
His chest and back were as much too broad , as his legs were too short . 
He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers ; wore a shawl round his neck ; smelt of lamp-oil , straw , orange-peel , horses ' provender , and sawdust ; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur , compounded of the stable and the play-house . 
`` You see , my friend , '' Mr. Bounderby put in , `` we are the kind of people who know the value of time , and you are the kind of people who do n't know the value of time . '' 
asked Mr. Gradgrind , glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance . 
ejaculated Bounderby , with his laugh of laughs . 
Bounderby repeated . 
interrupted Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Very well , '' said Bounderby . 
`` Perhaps so , '' replied Mr. Bounderby , rattling his money and laughing . 
Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again , he turned from him , as from a man finally disposed of , to Mr. Gradgrind . 
`` I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to -- '' `` Idleness , '' Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh . 
`` Her father always had it in his head , '' resumed Childers , feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby 's existence , `` that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all of education . 
Still , if her father really has left her , without any connivance on her part -- Bounderby , let me have a word with you . '' 
While thus engaged , he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby 's voice as `` No . 
Think of it , Bounderby , in that point of view . '' 
It was so pathetic to hear her saying many things of this kind , with her face turned upward and her arms stretched out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it , that no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby -LRB- growing impatient -RRB- took the case in hand . 
`` Now , good people all , '' said he , `` this is wanton waste of time . 
and Sleary , in some haste , communicated the following hint , apart to Mr. Bounderby . 
Mr Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion , Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject . 
The last words had a visible effect upon her . 
She stopped in her wild crying , a little detached herself from Emma Gordon , and turned her face full upon her patron . 
Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby stood near the door , ready to take her away . 
Mr. Bounderby being a bachelor , an elderly lady presided over his establishment , in consideration of a certain annual stipend . 
Mrs. Sparsit was this lady 's name ; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby 's car , as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside . 
And here she was now , in her elderly days , with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit , making Mr. Bounderby 's tea as he took his breakfast . 
If Bounderby had been a Conqueror , and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions , he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did . 
Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction , so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit 's . 
In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favorable circumstance , he brightened Mrs. Sparsit 's juvenile career with every possible advantage , and showered wagon-loads of early roses all over that lady 's path . 
`` And yet , sir , '' he would say , `` how does it turn out after all ? 
Nay , he made this foil of his so very widely known , that third parties took it up , and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness . 
It was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby , that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them . 
There was a moral infection of clap-trap in him . 
Strangers , modest enough elsewhere , started up at dinners in Coketown , and boasted , in quite a rampant way , of Bounderby . 
They made him out to be the Royal arms , the Union-Jack , Magna Charta , John Bull , Habeas Corpus , the Bill of Rights , An Englishman 's house is his castle , Church and State , and God save the Queen , all put together . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , '' said Mrs. Sparsit , `` you are unusually slow , sir , with your breakfast this morning . '' 
`` She must wait , ma'am , '' answered Bounderby , `` till I know myself . 
`` Of course she can if you wish it , Mr. Bounderby . '' 
`` I told him I would give her a shake-down here , last night , in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with Louisa . '' 
`` Indeed , Mr. Bounderby ? 
`` It 's tolerably clear to me , '' said Bounderby , `` that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship . '' 
`` Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind , Mr. Bounderby ? '' 
`` Louisa , '' repeated Mr. Bounderby . 
Mrs. Sparsit 's `` sir , '' in addressing Mr. Bounderby , was a word of ceremony , rather exacting consideration for herself in the use , than honoring him . 
`` I 'm not going to take him at once ; he is to finish his educational cramming before then , '' said Bounderby . 
Which , by the by , he probably did know , for he had heard of it often enough . 
`` Egad , ma'am , so was I , '' said Bounderby , '' -- with the wrong side of it . 
Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table , and stand with his back to the fire , looking at her ; she was such an enhancement of his position . 
Devilish high society , '' he said , warming his legs . 
`` It is true , sir , '' returned Mrs. Sparsit , with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his , and therefore in no danger of jostling it . 
`` You were in the tiptop fashion , and all the rest of it , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby , bending himself at the knees , literally embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud . 
`` Can Jupe be sent here , Bounderby ? '' 
On coming in , she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby , and to his friend Tom Gradgrind , and also to Louisa ; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit . 
Observing this , the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make : `` Now , I tell you what , my girl . 
`` I hope , Bounderby , '' said Mr. Gradgrind , in a conciliatory voice , `` that this was merely an oversight . '' 
`` My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests , Mrs. Sparsit , '' said Bounderby , `` that this was merely an oversight . 
Bounderby , this is a case for rigid training , and I shall observe it with interest . '' 
`` Well , '' returned Mr. Bounderby , `` I have given you my opinion already , and I should n't do as you do . 
And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits . 
However , when I go to live with old Bounderby , I 'll have my revenge . '' 
Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks , and is a great deal rougher , and not half so kind . '' 
I shall very well know how to manage and smoothe old Bounderby ! '' 
When he says to me what I do n't like , I shall say to him , ` My sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed , Mr. Bounderby . 
That 'll bring him about , or nothing will . '' 
`` Tom , '' enquired his sister , slowly , and in a curious tone , as if she were reading what she asked , in the fire , and it were not quite plainly written there , `` do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby 's ? '' 
`` Only father has brought old Bounderby home , and I want you to come into the drawing-room . 
Because if you come , there 's a good chance of old Bounderby 's asking me to dinner ; and if you do n't , there 's none . '' 
Look sharp for old Bounderby , Loo ! '' 
I keep the nine oils ready for him , and I know he will come back . 
`` Do look sharp for old Bounderby , Loo ! '' 
`` He 'll be off , if you do n't look sharp ! '' 
He turned from his own class and his own quarter , taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along , towards the hill on which his principal employer lived , in a red house with black outside shutters , green inside blinds , a black street door , up two white steps , Bounderby -LRB- in letters very like himself -RRB- upon a brazen plate , and a round brazen doorhandle underneath it like a brazen full-stop . 
Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch . 
Mr. Bounderby -LRB- whom he just knew by sight -RRB- , at lunch on chop and sherry . 
`` Now , Stephen , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` what 's the matter with you ? '' 
`` Now , you know , '' said Mr. Bounderby , taking some sherry , `` we have never had any difficulty with you , and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones . 
Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole , immediate , and direct object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied ; `` and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a complaint . 
Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised , notwithstanding his previous strong conviction . 
`` Very well , '' he returned . 
`` I can go , Mr. Bounderby , if you wish it , '' said that self-sacrificing lady , making a feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup . 
Mr. Bounderby stayed her , by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it , and putting out his left hand . 
Then , withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop , he said to Stephen : `` Now , you know , this good lady is a born lady , a high lady . 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Bounderby , pushing away his plate , and leaning back . 
`` I have heard all this before , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
-LRB- `` The more fool you , I think , '' said Mr. Bounderby , in confidence to his wine-glass . -RRB- 
Every line in his face deepened as he said it , and put in its affecting evidence of the suffering he had undergone . 
In the strength of his misfortune , and the energy of his distress , he fired for the moment like a proud man . 
In another moment , he stood as he had stood all the time -- his usual stoop upon him ; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby , with a curious expression on it , half shrewd , half perplexed , as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult ; his hat held tight in his left hand , which rested on his hip ; his right arm , with a rugged propriety and force of action , very earnestly emphasising what he said : not least so when it always paused , a little bent , but not withdrawn , as he paused . 
`` I was acquainted with all this , you know , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` except the last clause , long ago . 
said Mr. Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a sidelong way that had an odd sheepishness about it . 
He fortified himself with a little more sherry . 
he then asked , turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool . 
said Bounderby , getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece . 
`` No how , '' returned Mr. Bounderby . 
There 's a sanctity in this relation of life , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` and -- and -- it must be kept up . '' 
said Mr. Bounderby , putting his hands in his pockets . 
`` Why , you 'd have to go to Doctors ' Commons with a suit , and you 'd have to go to a court of Common Law with a suit , and you 'd have to go to the House of Lords with a suit , and you 'd have to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again , and it would cost you -LRB- if it was a case of very plain-sailing -RRB- , I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Why then , sir , '' said Stephen , turning white , and motioning with that right hand of his , as if he gave everything to the four winds , ''' tis a muddle . 
Do n't you talk nonsense , my good fellow , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` about things you do n't understand ; and do n't you call the Institutions of your country a muddle , or you 'll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings . 
Mr. Bounderby resumed , as a valedictory address . 
-LRB- he repeated it with great relish -RRB- . 
Now you know ; '' here his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness ; `` I can see as far into a grindstone as another man ; farther than a good many , perhaps , because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young . 
cried Mr. Bounderby , shaking his head with obstinate cunning . 
So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall , as if he were going to explode himself into it ; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup , looking quite cast down by the popular vices . 
pointing back to Mr. Bounderby 's . 
I have been standing about , on this side of the way , to see that gentleman , '' turning her head back towards Mr. Bounderby 's again , `` come out . 
`` Really , '' said Mr. Gradgrind , `` the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby . '' 
Time , sticking to him , passed him on into Bounderby 's Bank , made him an inmate of Bounderby 's house , necessitated the purchase of his first razor , and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to number one . 
The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed Sissy onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed . 
`` Why , I have been otherwise engaged , Loo , in the evenings ; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather . 
But I touch him up with you , when he comes it too strong , and so we preserve an understanding . 
He 's with old Bounderby . 
I have undertaken then to let you know that -- in short , that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure , and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage . 
That time , to which he has so long , and certainly with great constancy , looked forward , is now come . 
Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me , and has entreated me to make it known to you , and to express his hope that you will take it into your favorable consideration . '' 
`` Father , '' said Louisa , `` do you think I love Mr. Bounderby ? '' 
`` Father , '' pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before , `` do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby ? '' 
`` Father , '' she still pursued , `` does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him ? '' 
Now , Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice , and does not do himself the injustice , of pretending to anything fanciful , fantastic , or -LRB- I am using synonymous terms -RRB- sentimental . 
Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes , to very little purpose , if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense , not to say to his , as to address you from any such ground . 
You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; Mr. Bounderby is , we will say in round numbers , fifty . 
Confining yourself rigidly to Fact , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him ? 
Yes , he does . 
The sole remaining question then is : Shall I marry him ? 
`` Shall I marry him ? '' 
`` Mr. Bounderby , '' she went on in a steady , straight way , without regarding this , `` asks me to marry him . 
The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ? 
Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus , I am satisfied to accept his proposal . 
Tell him , father , as soon as you please , that this was my answer . 
Repeat it , word for word , if you can , because I should wish him to know what I said . '' 
Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you -- if any -- is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired . 
Mr. Bounderby 's first disquietude , on hearing of his happiness , was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit . 
He could not make up his mind how to do that , or what the consequences of the step might be . 
Whether she would instantly depart , bag and baggage , to Lady Scadgers , or would positively refuse to budge from the premises ; whether she would be plaintive or abusive , tearful or tearing ; whether she would break her heart , or break the looking-glass ; Mr. Bounderby could not at all foresee . 
However , as it must be done , he had no choice but to do it ; so , after attempting several letters , and failing in them all , he resolved to do it by word of mouth . 
On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist 's shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts . 
said Mr. Bounderby , `` if she takes it in the fainting way , I 'll have the skin off her nose , at all events ! '' 
But , in spite of being thus forearmed , he entered his own house with anything but a courageous air ; and appeared before the object of his misgivings , like a dog who was conscious of coming direct from the pantry . 
`` Good evening , Mr. Bounderby ! '' 
He drew up his chair , and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers , as who should say , `` Your fireside , sir . 
said Mr. Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her , as , with the points of a stiff , sharp pair of scissors , she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose , in a piece of cambric . 
She was so stedfastly occupied , that many minutes elapsed before she looked up from her work ; when she did so , Mr. Bounderby bespoke her attention with a hitch of his head . 
`` Mrs. Sparsit ma'am , '' said Mr. Bounderby , putting his hands in his pockets , and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use , `` I have no occasion to say to you , that you are not only a lady born and bred , but a devilish sensible woman . '' 
`` Mrs. Sparsit ma'am , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` I am going to astonish you . '' 
`` I am going , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` to marry Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . '' 
`` I hope you may be happy , Mr. Bounderby . 
And she said it with such great condescension , as well as with such great compassion for him , that Bounderby , -- far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her work-box at the mirror , or swooned on the hearth-rug , -- corked up the smelling-salts tight in his pocket , and thought , `` Now con-found this woman , who could have ever guessed that she would take it in this way ! '' 
`` I wish with all my heart , sir , '' said Mrs. Sparsit , in a highly superior manner ; somehow she seemed , in a moment , to have established a right to pity him ever afterwards ; `` that you may be in all respects very happy . '' 
`` Well , ma'am , '' returned Bounderby , with some resentment in his tone : which was clearly lowered , though in spite of himself , `` I am obliged to you . 
A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby 's part , succeeded . 
`` Well , ma'am , '' resumed Bounderby , `` under these circumstances , I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here , though you would be very welcome here ? '' 
`` However , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` there are apartments at the Bank , where a born and bred lady , as keeper of the place , would be rather a catch than otherwise ; and if the same terms -- '' `` I beg your pardon , sir . 
`` The proposal is like yourself , and if the position I should assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale -- '' `` Why , of course it is , '' said Bounderby . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , you are very considerate . '' 
`` You 'll have your own private apartments , and you 'll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it , and you 'll have your maid to attend upon you , and you 'll have your light porter to protect you , and you 'll be what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable , '' said Bounderby . 
It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster , or to assert himself in any of his explosive ways ; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him , as a Victim . 
Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnised in eight weeks ' time , and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer . 
Shortly after which oration , as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons , in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts , and whether they , too , required to be fed with gold spoons ; the happy pair departed for the railroad . 
`` Old Bounderby 's quite ready , '' said Tom . 
Besides Mr. Bounderby 's gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown , another prevalent fiction was very popular there . 
Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill-used -- that is to say , whenever he was not left entirely alone , and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts -- he was sure to come out with the awful menace , that he would `` sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic . '' 
Her own private sitting-room was a story higher , at the window of which post of observation she was ready , every morning , to greet Mr. Bounderby as he came across the road , with the sympathising recognition appropriate to a Victim . 
It was a size to larger than Mr. Bounderby 's house , as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller ; in all other particulars , it was strictly according to pattern . 
`` I hold a trust here , Bitzer , under Mr. Bounderby . 
However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago , that he would ever become my patron , making me an annual compliment , I can not but regard him in that light . 
From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station , and every recognition of my family descent , that I could possibly expect . 
`` What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening , unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late , I do n't know , '' said Mrs. Sparsit ; `` but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby , and I will never shrink from it . 
If to see him is any part of the duty I have accepted , I will see him . 
I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby the banker . 
`` -- Raw material -- where Mr. Bounderby the banker , might reside . 
Fact being , I presume , that Mr. Bounderby the Banker , does not reside in the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation ? '' 
`` No , sir , '' returned Mrs. Sparsit , `` he does not . '' 
But strolling on to the Bank to kill time , and having the good fortune to observe at the window , '' towards which he languidly waved his hand , then slightly bowed , `` a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance , I considered that I could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker , does live . 
Mrs. Sparsit recognised the hand , intimated that such confirmation was quite unnecessary , and gave Mr. Bounderby 's address , with all needful clues and directions in aid . 
Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit , which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand ; superscribed , `` Josiah Bounderby , Esquire , Banker , Coketown . 
Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse 's card , Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel . 
There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window , in a state of mind so disconsolate , that he was already half disposed to `` go in '' for something else . 
`` Coketown , sir , '' said Bounderby , obstinately taking a chair , `` is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to . 
`` Do n't be too sure of that , '' said Bounderby . 
By way of `` going in '' to the fullest extent , Mr. Hart-house rejoined , `` Mr. Bounderby , I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking . 
`` I am glad to hear it , '' said Bounderby . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , perfectly right . '' 
`` Lastly , '' said Bounderby , `` as to our Hands . 
`` Why , you see , '' replied Mr. Bounderby , `` it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man , particularly with a public man , when I make his acquaintance . 
If anything could have exalted Jem 's interest in Mr. Bounderby , it would have been this very circumstance . 
Or , so he told him . 
`` So now , '' said Bounderby , `` we may shake hands on equal terms . 
Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favor . 
`` Perhaps you know , '' said he , `` or perhaps you do n't know , I married Tom Gradgrind 's daughter . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , '' said Jem , `` you anticipate my dearest wishes . '' 
They went out without further discourse ; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him , to the private red brick dwelling , with the black outside shutters , the green inside blinds , and the black street door up the two white steps . 
As Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his household gods , so those unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby , and they were worthy of one another , and well matched . 
`` This , sir , '' said Bounderby , `` is my wife , Mrs. Bounderby : Tom Gradgrind 's eldest daughter . 
To a more agreeable adviser , or one from whom he would be more likely to learn , Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , '' said Jem , turning with a smile to Louisa , `` is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state , quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works . '' 
`` You respect Mr. Bounderby very much , '' she quietly returned . 
`` You are going to devote yourself , as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said , to the service of your country . 
Mr. Bounderby , who had been in danger of bursting in silence , interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six , and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity . 
It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap ` orth of stewed eels he had purchased in the streets at eight years old ; and also of the inferior water , specially used for laying the dust , with which he had washed down that repast . 
He likewise entertained his guest , over the soup and fish , with the calculation that he -LRB- Bounderby -RRB- had eaten in his youth at least three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys . 
every now and then ; and they probably would have decided him to `` go in '' for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning , had he been less curious respecting Louisa . 
`` Is there nothing , '' he thought , glancing at her as she sat at the head of the table , where her youthful figure , small and slight , but very graceful , looked as pretty as it looked misplaced ; `` is there nothing that will move that face ? '' 
`` When I was your age , young Tom , '' said Bounderby , `` I was punctual , or I got no dinner ! '' 
`` Never mind that now , '' said Bounderby . 
Both in his sister 's presence , and after she had left the room , the whelp took no pains to hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby , whenever he could indulge it without the observation of that independent man , by making wry faces , or shutting one eye . 
Well , Mr. Harthouse , I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night . '' 
`` What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is , I think you mean , '' said Tom . 
I do n't care for old Bounderby , '' said he , `` if you mean that . 
I have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him , and I have always thought of him in the same way . 
I am not going to begin to be polite now , about old Bounderby . 
`` Do n't mind me , '' returned James ; `` but take care when his wife is by , you know . '' 
`` His wife ? '' 
`` She never cared for old Bounderby . '' 
Why , you wo n't tell me , Mr. Harthouse , that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby . '' 
`` You know our governor , Mr. Harthouse , '' said Tom , `` and therefore you need n't be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby . 
She never had a lover , and the governor proposed old Bounderby , and she took him . '' 
`` I was stuck into old Bounderby 's bank -LRB- where I never wanted to be -RRB- , and I knew I should get into scrapes there , if she put old Bounderby 's pipe out ; so I told her my wishes , and she came into them . 
It was n't as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby ; but still it was a good thing in her . '' 
`` I mean to say , Mr. Harthouse , that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby 's , I was as flat as a warming-pan , and knew no more about life , than any oyster does . '' 
`` Calling at the Bank yesterday evening , for Mr. Bounderby 's address , I found an ancient lady there , who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister , '' observed Mr. James Harthouse , throwing away the last small remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out . 
Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor . 
`` I 'm th ' one single Hand in Bounderby 's mill , o ' a ' the men theer , as do n't coom in wi ` th ' proposed reg ` lations . 
Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you . 
You know his house , do n't you ? '' 
Stephen , whose way had been in the contrary direction , turned about , and betook himself as in duty bound , to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby . 
`` Well Stephen , '' said Bounderby , in his windy manner , `` what 's this I hear ? 
It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden . 
A tea-table was set out ; and Mr. Bounderby 's young wife , and her brother , and a great gentleman from London , were present . 
`` This is the man I was telling you about , Harthouse , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
The gentleman he addressed , who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa , got up , saying in an indolent way , `` Oh really ? '' 
and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood . 
`` Now , '' said Bounderby , `` speak up ! '' 
After the four days he had passed , this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen 's ear . 
`` Why , I have told you , '' returned Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby , who was always more or less like a Wind , finding something in his way here , began to blow at it directly . 
`` Now , look here , Harthouse , '' said he , `` here 's a specimen of 'em . 
`` Now , you 'll think this pretty well , Harthouse , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
said Mr. Bounderby , with his thumbs in the arms of his coat , and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite wall : `` how it happens . '' 
`` Not to me , you know , '' said Bounderby . 
`` As for me , any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it , '' said Bounderby , still in confidence with the wall . 
`` Though he knows , '' said Mr. Bounderby , now blowing a gale , `` that these are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for ! 
And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection , with angry finger . 
`` In short , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` it 's because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift . 
`` How 't is , ma'am , '' resumed Stephen , appearing still to find his natural refuge in Louisa 's face , `` that what is best in us fok , seems to turn us most to trouble an misfort 'n an mistake , I dunno . 
`` Now , my friend , '' said Mr. Bounderby , whom he could not have exasperated more , quite unconscious of it though he was , than by seeming to appeal to any one else , `` if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute , I should like to have a word or two with you . 
`` Here 's a gentleman from London present , '' Mr. Bounderby made a back-handed point at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb , `` a Parliament gentleman . 
He turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge , but at a look from that quarter -LRB- expressive though instantaneous -RRB- he settled them on Mr. Bounderby 's face . 
asked Mr. Bounderby . 
`` What , '' repeated Mr. Bounderby , folding his arms , `` do you people , in a general way , complain of ? '' 
`` Of course , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
`` I 'll tell you something towards it , at any rate , '' returned Mr. Bounderby . 
Stephen gravely shook his head . 
`` Do n't tell me we wo n't , man , '' said Mr. Bounderby , by this time blowing a hurricane , `` because we will , I tell you ! '' 
Reverting for a moment to his former refuge , he observed a cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door . 
`` Just stop a moment , '' said Mr. Bounderby , excessively red in the face . 
`` Now , it 's clear to me , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance . 
`` You are such a waspish , raspish , ill-conditioned chap , you see , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` that even your own Union , the men who know you best , will have nothing to do with you . 
`` You can finish off what you 're at , '' said Mr. Bounderby , with a meaning nod , `` and then go elsewhere . '' 
It was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby 's house . 
I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married . 
the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm ; `` and I want to see his wife . 
Before he had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby 's door , he had reflected that at least his being obliged to go away was good for her , as it would save her from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from him . 
`` Bounderby ! '' 
`` But hearken , missus , hearken ; '' said Stephen , astonished , '' 'T is n't Mr. Bounderby ; 't is his wife . 
There was the land who had once kept Mr. Bounderby 's house , sitting at the first floor window as he had seen her before ; and there was the light porter , sometimes talking with her there , and sometimes looking over the blind below which had BANK upon it , and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air . 
Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother , the honorable and jocular member , that the Bounderbys were `` great fun ; '' and further , that the female Bounderby , instead of being the Gorgon he had expected , was young , and remarkably pretty . 
After that , he wrote no more about them , and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house . 
He was very often in their house , in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district ; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby . 
It was quite in Mr. Bounderby 's gusty way to boast to all his world that he did n't care about your highly connected people , but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind 's daughter did , she was welcome to their company . 
Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds , about fifteen miles from the town , and accessible within a mile or two , by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country , undermined by deserted coal-shafts , and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits ' mouths . 
This country , gradually softening towards the neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , there mellowed into a rustic landscape , golden with heath , and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of the year , and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer time . 
The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the Coketown magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous forture , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds . 
It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this snug little estate , and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden . 
He delighted to live , barrack-fashion , among the elegant furniture , and he bullied the very pictures with his origin . 
`` Why , sir , '' he would say to a visitor , `` I am told that Nickits , '' the late owner , `` gave seven hundred pound for that Sea-beach . 
With all possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby , I think I perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training . 
Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play , he rushes into these extremes for himself , from opposite extremes that have long been forced -- with the very best intentions we have no doubt -- upon him . 
Mr. Bounderby 's fine bluff English independence , though a most charming characteristic , does not -- as we have agreed -- invite confidence . 
They had stopped among a disorder of roses -- it was part of Mr. Bounderby 's humility to keep Nickits 's roses on a reduced scale -- and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet , plucking buds and picking them to pieces ; while his powerful Familiar stood over him , with a foot upon the parapet , and his figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee . 
Here 's old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon two-pence a month , or something of that sort . 
It 's of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now , after what I have told you already ; you know she did n't marry old Bounderby for her own sake , or for his sake , but for my sake . 
Then why does n't she get what I want , out of him , for my sake ? 
She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it ; she is sharp enough ; she could manage to coax it out of him , if she chose . 
There she sits in his company like a stone , instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily . 
When Tom appeared before dinner , though his mind seemed heavy enough , his body was on the alert ; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in . 
`` I did n't mean to be cross , Loo , '' he said , giving her his hand , and kissing her . 
There was a sweep of some half mile between the lodge and the house , and he was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth gravel , once Nickits 's , when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery , with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road . 
cried Mr. Bounderby . 
said Harthouse , soothing his horse , and inwardly favoring Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes . 
Mr. Bounderby , red and hot , planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse 's head , to explode his bombshell with more effect . 
Mr. Bounderby , in his desire to make the most of it , really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply , `` Why , no ; not of very much . 
as a sum -- if you stick to a sum -- of not more than a hundred and fifty pound , '' said Bounderby , with impatience . 
`` My dear Bounderby , '' said James , dismounting , and giving his bridle to his servant , `` I do see it ; and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be , by the spectacle afforded to my mental view . 
`` Thank ` ee , '' replied Bounderby , in a short , ungracious manner . 
said Mr. Bounderby , with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head , `` It might have been twice twenty . 
`` Here 's Tom Gradgrind 's daughter knows pretty well what it might have been , if you do n't , '' blustered Bounderby . 
James Harthouse begged her to take his arm ; and as they moved on very slowly , asked her how the robbery had been committed . 
`` Why , I am going to tell you , '' said Bounderby , irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit . 
retorted Bounderby , stopping to wheel round upon him , `` let 's have none of your interruptions . 
Bitzer knuckled his forehead again , in a sneaking manner , and seemed at once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Bounderby 's moral abstinence . 
`` A hundred and fifty odd pound , '' resumed Mr. Bounderby . 
said the exasperated Bounderby , `` while he was snoring , or choking , or Dutch-clocking , or something or other -- being asleep -- some fellows , somehow , whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen , got to young Tom 's safe , forced it , and abstracted the contents . 
`` He has been helping the police , '' said Bounderby , `` and stays behind at the Bank . 
said Bounderby , relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit 's arm to wipe his heated head . 
`` Well , '' said Bounderby , stopping and facing about to confront them all , `` I 'll tell you . 
Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again . 
`` What should you say to ; '' here he violently exploded : `` to a Hand being in it ? '' 
`` Say Pool instead of Pot , sir , '' returned Bounderby , `` and that 's the man . '' 
said Bounderby , immediately catching at the sound . 
`` But I am acquainted with these chaps , '' said Bounderby . 
`` When he shocked you , ma'am , '' said Bounderby ; `` when he shocked your feelings ? '' 
Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse , as much as to say , `` I am the proprietor of this female , and she 's worth your attention , I think . '' 
Then , resumed his discourse . 
What do you say ; '' Mr. Bounderby , with his hat in his hand , gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences , as if it were a tambourine ; `` to his being seen -- night after night -- watching the Bank ? 
Having come to the climax , Mr. Bounderby , like an oriental dancer , put his tambourine on his head . 
`` I think so , sir , '' said Bounderby , with a defiant nod . 
`` This is not all of 'em , even as we already know 'em , '' said Bounderby , with many nods of hidden meaning . 
The same Hermitical state of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner , until fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them ; when she said , `` Indeed you are very good , sir ; '' and departed from a resolution of which she had made rather formal and public announcement , to `` wait for the simple mutton . '' 
She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt ; and , feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves , occasionally sat back in her chair and silently wept ; at which periods a tear of large dimensions , like a crystal ear-ring , might be observed -LRB- or rather , must be , for it insisted on public notice -RRB- sliding down her Roman nose . 
But Mrs. Sparsit 's greatest point , first and last , was her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby . 
There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head , as who would say , `` Alas poor Yorick ! '' 
After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion , she would force a lambent brightness , and would be fitfully cheerful , and would say , `` You have still good spirits , sir , I am thankful to find ; '' and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did . 
In the drawing-room after dinner , Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery , examined the witnesses , made notes of the evidence , found the suspected persons guilty , and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the law . 
Mr. Bounderby , upon whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him , in a bull-headed blundering way , sentimental , sighed like some large sea-animal . 
`` I have n't played backgammon , ma'am , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` since that time . '' 
said Mr. Bounderby ; `` you do n't see a Fire , do you ? '' 
said Mr. Bounderby . 
`` She never takes cold , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
When the time drew near for retiring , Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water . 
`` Why I have got out of the habit of taking it now , ma'am , '' said Mr. Bounderby . 
Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she pleased , that considerate lady made the beverage , and handed it to Mr. Bounderby . 
And when Mr. Bounderby said , `` Your health , ma'am ! '' 
Finally , she wished him good night , with great pathos ; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed , with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender , though he could not , for his life , have mentioned what it was . 
Mrs. Sparsit , lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , kept such a sharp look-out , night and day , under her Coriolanian eyebrows , that her eyes , like a couple of lighthouses on an iron-bound coast , might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold rock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood , but for the placidity of her manner . 
`` It appears but yesterday , sir , '' said Mrs. Sparsit , `` that I had the honor of receiving you at the Bank , when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby 's address . '' 
Ay , and indeed here is Mr. Bounderby ! '' 
Now , these persistent assuagements of his misery , and lightenings of his load , had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit , and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward . 
So , when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart , `` You want your breakfast , sir , but I daresay Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table , '' Mr. Bounderby replied , `` If I waited to be taken care of by my wife , ma'am , I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday , so I 'll trouble you to take charge of the teapot . '' 
She was so humble withal , that when Louisa appeared , she rose , protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances , often as she had had the honor of making Mr. Bounderby 's breakfast , before Mrs. Gradgrind -- she begged pardon , she meant to say , Miss Bounderby -- she hoped to be excused , but she really could not get it right yet , though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by -- had assumed her present position . 
It was only -LRB- she observed -RRB- because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late , and Mr. Bounderby 's time was so very precious , and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment , that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request : long as his will had been a law to her . 
Stop where you are , ma'am , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` stop where you are ! 
said Mr. Bounderby , in a blustering way to his wife . 
said Mr. Bounderby , swelling with a sense of slight . 
repeated Bounderby . 
`` I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident , or too delicate , '' Louisa answered him composedly : `` I have never made that objection to you , either as a child or as a woman . 
returned Mr. Bounderby . 
She looked at him , as he struck the table and made the teacups ring , with a proud colour in her face that was a new change , Mr. Harthouse thought . 
But from this day , the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together , and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence against him with another , into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not retrace them if she tried . 
Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured `` My benefactor ! '' 
Yet it is an indubitable fact , within the cognizance of this history , that five minutes after he had left the house in the self same hat , the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers , shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait , made a contemptuous grimace at that work of art , and said `` Serve you right , you Noodle , and I am glad of it ! '' 
Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone , when Bitzer appeared . 
Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise , to be visited , as she reclined upon her sofa ; young people , Louisa felt herself all unfit for ; Sissy she had never softened to again , since the night when the stroller 's child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby 's intended wife . 
Mrs. Sparsit 's nerves being slow to recover their tone , the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby 's retreat , where , notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming consciousness of her altered station , she resigned herself with noble fortitude , to lodging , as one may say , in clover , and feeding on the fat of the land . 
During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank , Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency ; continuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face , as is rarely taken on man , and to call his portrait a Noodle to its face , with the greatest acrimony and contempt . 
Mr. Bounderby , having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts -LRB- for he had not yet settled what it was -RRB- , and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do , resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily . 
She had been descending steadily , to the day , and on the day , when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above . 
`` In a similar manner , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` I can wait , you know . 
`` No , ma'am , '' continued Bounderby , `` I have not heard anything more about it . 
The old woman you mentioned , sir -- '' `` The old woman I mentioned , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , cutting the matter short , as it was nothing to boast about , `` is not laid hold of ; but , she may take her oath she will be , if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind . 
Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby -- who , as we know , is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand . 
With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contra-distinguished from his portrait , Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent . 
So the time went on ; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days . 
It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank , adding : `` But you 'll go down to-morrow , ma'am , all the same . 
`` Well , ma'am , then you must get on in my absence as well as you can , '' said Bounderby , not displeased . 
`` Mr. Bounderby , '' retorted Mrs. Sparsit , `` your will is to me a law , sir ; otherwise , it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands , not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me , as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality . 
`` Why , when I invite you to my house , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , opening his eyes , `` I should hope you want no other invitation . '' 
blustered Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby , under the influence of this difficult adjuration , backed up by her compassionate eye , could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner , and afterwards assert himself at a distance , by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning . 
There , the report was , Mr. Bounderby away , and Mrs. Bounderby in town . 
In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town . 
He went to the house in town . 
He looked in at the Bank . 
Mr. Bounderby away , and Mrs. Sparsit away . 
Why , in my own bed at Bounderby 's . '' 
`` So , whether I am waiting for a hostile message , or an assignation , or a penitent remonstrance , or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner -- which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs -- I 'll dine , '' said Mr. James Harthouse . 
`` Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight ; and if anything of a British nature is to come off between us , it may be as well to be in training . '' 
One , to Mr. Bounderby , announcing his retirement from that part of the country , and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight . 
Having executed her mission with infinite relish , this high-minded woman then fainted away on Mr. Bounderby 's coatcollar . 
Mr. Bounderby 's first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off , and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor . 
He next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives , such as screwing the patient 's thumbs , smiting her hands , abundantly watering her face , and inserting salt in her mouth . 
When these attentions had recovered her -LRB- which they speedily did -RRB- , he hustled her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment , and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive . 
Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution , and adamant to her pathetic sneezes , Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach , and bore her off to Stone Lodge . 
`` Now , Tom Gradgrind , '' said Bounderby , bursting into his father-in-law 's room late at night ; `` here 's a lady here -- Mrs. Sparsit -- you know Mrs. Sparsit -- who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb . '' 
bawled Bounderby . 
`` Bounderby , '' said Mr. Gradgrind , in a tone of temperate remonstrance , `` I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa . '' 
`` Tom Gradgrind , '' replied Bounderby , knocking the flat of his hand serveral times with great vehemence on the table , `` I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me , in reference to Louisa . 
That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony , without any voice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat , became so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions , that Mr. Bounderby , unable to bear it , seized her by the arm and shook her . 
`` If you ca n't get it out ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` leave me to get it out . 
cried Bounderby . 
`` And in that conversation -- '' `` It is not necessary to repeat its tenor , Bounderby . 
Perhaps , '' said Bounderby , starting with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law , `` you know where your daughter is at the present time ? '' 
`` My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud outbreaks , on all accounts . 
Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments , in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit 's direction ; and then , abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers , said to that wretched woman : `` Now , ma'am ! 
`` Well , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is , that there 's something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach . 
With these words , Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady and escorted her to the conveyance in question , shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way . 
He soon returned alone . 
`` Now , as you showed me in your face , Tom Gradgrind , that you wanted to speak to me , '' he resumed , `` here I am . 
Mr. Gradgrind , it will be observed , being much softened , Mr. Bounderby took particular pains to harden himself at all points . 
It was his amiable nature . 
`` My dear Bounderby , '' Mr. Gradgrind began in reply . 
`` Now , you 'll excuse me , '' said Bounderby , `` but I do n't want to be too dear . 
`` Bounderby , '' urged Mr. Gradgrind , `` we are all liable to mistakes -- '' `` I thought you could n't make 'em , '' interrupted Bounderby . 
said Bounderby . 
And he sat for a little while pondering . 
`` Bounderby , I see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa . '' 
`` Let me say I , then , '' he returned , in answer to the coarsely blurted question ; `` I doubt whether I have understood Louisa . 
`` There you hit it , '' returned Bounderby . 
`` I do n't see it at all , sir , '' returned the obstinate Bounderby . 
I seek to repair what is amiss , if I possibly can ; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit , Bounderby , for I have been very much distressed . '' 
`` I do n't understand you , yet , '' said Bounderby , with determined obstinacy , `` and therefore I wo n't make any promises . '' 
`` In the course of a few hours , my dear Bounderby , '' Mr. Gradgrind proceeded , in the same depressed and propitiatory manner , `` I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa 's character , than in previous years . 
I think there are -- Bounderby , you will be surprised to hear me say this -- I think there are qualities in Louisa , which -- which have been harshly neglected , and -- and a little perverted . 
The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words , that he seemed to be , and probably was , on the brink of a fit . 
With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson , he pent up his indignation , however , and said : `` You 'd like to keep her here for a time ? '' 
`` I -- I had intended to recommend , my dear Bounderby , that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit , and be attended by Sissy -LRB- I mean of course Cecilia Jupe -RRB- , who understands her , and in whom she trusts . '' 
`` I gather from all this , Tom Gradgrind , '' said Bounderby , standing up with his hands in his pockets , `` that you are of opinion that there 's what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself . '' 
`` I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa , and -- and -- and almost all the relations in which I have placed her , '' was her father 's sorrowful reply . 
`` Now , look you here , Tom Gradgrind , '' said Bounderby the flushed , confronting him with his legs wide apart , his hands deeper in his pockets , and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was boisterous . 
`` Bounderby , '' said Mr. Gradgrind , `` I hoped , after my entreaty , you would have taken a different tone . '' 
`` Just wait a bit , '' retorted Bounderby , `` you have said your say , I believe . 
`` Bounderby , '' urged Mr. Gradgrind , `` this is unreasonable . '' 
said Bounderby . 
He discharged this , like a Rocket , at his father-in-law 's head . 
`` Whereas your daughter , '' proceeded Bounderby , `` is far from being a born lady . 
`` Hear me out , '' said Bounderby , `` and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round . 
`` Bounderby , '' returned Mr. Gradgrind , rising , `` the less we say to-night the better , I think . '' 
That is , '' the consideration checked him , `` till I have said all I mean to say , and then I do n't care how soon we stop . 
`` What do I mean , Bounderby ? '' 
`` By your visiting proposition , '' said Bounderby , with an inflexible jerk of the hayfield . 
said Bounderby . 
said Bounderby . 
Is it asking too much , Bounderby , that you , so far her elder , should aid in trying to set her right ? 
You have accepted a great charge of her ; for better for worse , for -- '' Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to Stephen Blackpool , but he cut the quotation short with an angry start . 
said he , `` I do n't want to be told about that . 
`` I was merely going on to remark , Bounderby , that we may all be more or less in the wrong , not even excepting you ; and that some yielding on your part , remembering the trust you have accepted , may not only be an act of true kindness , but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa . '' 
`` I think differently , '' blustered Bounderby . 
`` Let me seriously entreat you to re-consider this , Bounderby , '' urged Mr. Gradgrind , `` before you commit yourself to such a decision . '' 
`` I always come to a decision , '' said Bounderby , tossing his hat on : `` and whatever I do , I do at once . 
So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed . 
At five minutes past twelve o'clock next day , he directed Mrs. Bounderby 's property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind 's ; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract ; and resumed a bachelor life . 
Things having come to this pass , and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it , the upshot of Mr. Bounderby 's investigations was , that he resolved to hazard a bold burst . 
He drew up a placard , offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool , suspected of complicity in the robbery of the Coketown Bank on such a night ; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress , complexion , estimated height , and manner , as minutely as he could ; he recited how he had left the town , and in what direction he had been last seen going ; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet ; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night , so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow . 
`` It is Mr. Bounderby , '' said Sissy , timid of the name , `` and your brother Mr.Tom , and a young woman who says her name is Rachael , and that you know her . '' 
Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby , and said , `` Will you make it known , young lady , where , and who was there ? '' 
demanded Bounderby . 
`` Thank you , ma'am , '' said Bounderby . 
Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again . 
said Bounderby . 
She said nothing in reply ; and her low weeping was the only sound that was heard , until Mr. Bounderby spoke . 
said he , `` you know what you have engaged to do . 
I could n't meet wi ' Mr. Bounderby then , and your brother sent me away , and I tried to find you , but you was not to be found , and I went back to work . 
-- and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby , and I found him , and I told him every word I knew ; and he believed no word I said , and brought me here . '' 
`` So far , that 's true enough , '' assented Mr. Bounderby , with his hands in his pockets and his hat on . 
You are not aware , perhaps , '' retorted Mr. Bounderby , `` that you yourself have been looked after now and then , not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business , on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep . 
cried Bounderby , shaking his head , with a whistle , `` he changes his name , does he ! 
`` All the surer , I suppose , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` for your refusing to tell where he is ? 
`` Notwithstanding which , '' added Mr. Bounderby , `` if he can be laid hold of any sooner , he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself . 
Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved , moved with him , kept close to him , and went away with him . 
The only parting salutation of which he delivered himself was a sulky `` Good night , father ! '' 
With a brief speech , and a scowl at his sister , he left the house . 
Since his sheet-anchor had come home , Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of speech . 
During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his shadow , assisting in all the proceedings . 
He was greatly excited , horribly fevered , bit his nails down to the quick , spoke in a hard rattling voice , and with lips that were black and burnt up . 
They were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby 's house stood . 
Several coaches were rattling before them and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby 's , and one of the latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the house , that they looked round involuntarily . 
The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby 's steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach , in an ecstacy of excitement , struggling to open the door ; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment , called to them to stop . 
Accordingly , the chance witnesses on the ground , consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five - and-twenty , closed in after Sissy and Rachael , as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize ; and the whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr. Bounderby 's dining room , where the people behind lost not a moment 's time in mounting on the chairs , to get the better of the people in front . 
`` Fetch Mr. Bounderby down ! '' 
`` Fetch Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Do n't tell me , '' said Mrs. Sparsit , aloud , `` I have told you twenty times , coming along , that I will not leave you till I have handed you over to him myself . '' 
Mr. Bounderby now appeared , accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp , with whom he had been holding conference upstairs . 
Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable , at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room . 
said he . 
Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased ; for Mr. Bounderby 's visage exhibited an extraordinary combination of all possible colors and expressions of discomfiture , as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his view . 
was his highly unexpected demand , in great warmth . 
roared Bounderby . 
She sat down stiffly in a chair , as if she were frozen ; and , with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby , slowly grated her mittens against one another , as if they were frozen too . 
asked Bounderby . 
Mr. Bounderby , with his hands in his pockets , walked in impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table , while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler 's appeal , and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed . 
Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done , Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady : `` I am surprised , madam , '' he observed with severity , `` that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son , after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him . '' 
The bystanders , on and off the dining-room chairs , raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler , and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament , when Mr. Bounderby , who had never ceased walking up and down , and had every moment swelled larger and larger , and grown redder and redder , stopped short . 
`` I do n't exactly know , '' said Mr. Bounderby , `` how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company , but I do n't inquire . 
Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms , holding the door open for the company to depart , there was a blustering sheepishness upon him , at once extremely crest-fallen and superlatively absurd . 
Detected as the Bully of humility , who had built his windy reputation upon lies , and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim -LRB- there is no meaner -RRB- to tack himself on to a pedigree , he cut a most ridiculous figure . 
With the people filing off at the door he held , who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town , to be given to the four winds , he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn , if he had had his ears cropped . 
As to the whelp ; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions , he had stuck close to Bounderby . 
He seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe . 
He never visited his sister , and had only seen her once since she went home : that is to say , on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby , as already related . 
There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister 's mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery . 
Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means , and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby 's retreat . 
Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work , only Sissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring ; but , later in the day , when the message brought an express from Coketown , Mr. Gradgrind and Louisa , and Mr. Bounderby , and the whelp , were also there . 
He had come straight away from his work , on being written to , and had walked the whole journey ; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby 's countryhouse after dark , when he fell . 
If Mr. Bounderby had ever know 'd me right -- if he 'd ever know 'd me at aw -- he would 'n ha ' took 'n offence wi ' me . 
He would 'n ha ' suspect 'n me . 
Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa , who held her father 's arm , but in a retired place by themselves . 
When the father reached home , he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby 's , desiring his son to come to him directly . 
The reply was , that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd , and seeing nothing of him since , had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge . 
In the morning , he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened , and seeing his son 's place empty -LRB- he had not the courage to look in at first -RRB- , went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there . 
To whom he said that , for reasons he would soon explain , but entreated not then to be asked for , he had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance for a little while . 
Also , that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool 's memory , and declaring the thief . 
Mr. Bounderby , quite confounded , stood stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him , swelling like an immense soap-bubble , without its beauty . 
But , caution being necessary in communicating with him -- for there was a greater danger every moment of his being suspected now , and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby himself , in a bullying vein of public zeal , might play a Roman part -- it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question , by a circuitous course , alone ; and that the unhappy father , setting forth in an opposite direction , should get round to the same bourne by another and wider route . 
Leaving old Bounderby to himself , and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off , and going home , just when I was in the greatest danger . 
I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby . 
Sir , I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom 's situation . 
Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him , and presumed to be wiser than he . 
Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant discovery of Mrs. Pegler , he turned this presumption , on the part of a woman in her dependent position , over and over in his mind , until it accumulated with turning like a great snowball . 
At last he made the discovery that to discharge this highly-connected female -- to have it in his power to say , `` She was a woman of family , and wanted to stick to me , but I would n't have it , and got rid of her '' -- would be to get the utmost possible amount of crowning glory out of the connection , and at the same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her deserts . 
Filled fuller than ever , with this great idea , Mr. Bounderby came in to lunch , and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days , where his portrait was . 
Since the Pegler affair , this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr. Bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition . 
said Mr. Bounderby , in a very short , rough way . 
repeated Mr. Bounderby . 
After which offensive implication , he cut himself a crust of bread , and threw the knife down with a noise . 
Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup , and said , `` Mr. Bounderby , sir ! '' 
retorted Mr. Bounderby . 
`` Now , I 'll tell you what , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , `` I am not come here to be bullied . 
-LRB- Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on ; foreseeing that if he allowed of details , he would be beaten . -RRB- 
`` You had better allow me , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , passing her , and getting his hand upon the lock ; `` because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you , before you go . 
Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn , and said with great politeness , `` Really , sir ? '' 
`` I have been thinking it over , you see , since the late affairs have happened , ma'am , '' said Bounderby ; `` and it appears to my poor judgment -- '' `` Oh ! 
Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby 's judgment is . 
Mr. Bounderby , very red and uncomfortable , resumed : `` It appears to me , ma'am , I say , that a different sort of establishment altogether , would bring out a lady of your powers . 
`` Then suppose you try , ma'am , '' said Bounderby , laying an envelope with a cheque in it , in her little basket . 
Thus saying , Mrs. Sparsit , with her Roman features like a medal struck to commemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby , surveyed him fixedly from head to foot , swept disdainfully past him , and ascended the staircase . 
Mr. Bounderby closed the door , and stood before the fire ; projecting himself after his old explosive manner into his portrait -- and into futurity . 
He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight , at the points of all the weapons in the female armory , with the grudging , smarting , peevish , tormenting Lady Scadgers , still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg , and gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter , in a mean little airless lodging , a mere closet for one , a mere crib for two ; but did he see more ? 
Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers , as the rising young man , so devoted to his master 's great merits , who had won young Tom 's place , and had almost captured young Tom himself , in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away ? 
Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will , whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs , past five and fifty years of age , each taking upon himself the name , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall , for ever lodge in Bounderby Buildings , for ever attend a Bounderby chapel , for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain , for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate , and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster ? 
Had he any prescience of the day , five years to come , when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street , and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble , plunder , false pretences , vile example , little service and much law ?
