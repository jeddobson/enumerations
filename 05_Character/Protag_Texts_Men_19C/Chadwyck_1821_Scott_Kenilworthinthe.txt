There is also in the said house , a chamber called Dudley 's chamber , where the Earl of Leicester 's wife was murdered ; of which this is the story following : `` Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , a very goodly personage , and singularly well featured , being a great favourite to Queen Elizabeth , it was thought , and commonly reported , that had he been a batchelor or widower , the Queen would have made him her husband ; to this end , to free himself of all obstacles , he commands , or perhaps , with fair flattering intreaties , desires his wife to repose herself here at his servant Anthony Forster 's house , who then lived in the aforesaid manor-house ; and also prescribed to Sir Richard Varney , -LRB- a prompter to this design , -RRB- at his coming hither , that he should first attempt to poison her , and if that did not take effect , then by any other way whatsoever to dispatch her . 
For Sir Richard Varney above-said , -LRB- the chief projector in this design , -RRB- who , by the Earl 's order , remained that day of her death alone with her , with one man only and Forster , who had that day forcibly sent away all her servants from her to Abington market , about three miles distant from this place ; they -LRB- I say , whether first stifling her , or else strangling her -RRB- afterwards flung her down a pair of stairs and broke her neck , using much violence upon her ; but , however , though it was vulgarly reported that she by chance fell down stairs , -LRB- but still without hurting her hood that was upon her head , -RRB- yet the inhabitants will tell you there , that she was conveyed from her usual chamber where she lay , to another where the bed 's head of the chamber stood close to a privy postern door , where they in the night came and stifled her in her bed , bruised her head very much , broke her neck , and at length flung her down stairs , thereby believing the world would have thought it a mischance , and so have blinded their villainy . 
But behold the mercy and justice of God in revenging and discovering this lady 's murder , for one of the persons that was a coadjutor in this murder , was afterwards taken for a felony in the marches of Wales , and offering to publish the manner of the aforesaid murder , was privately made away in the prison by the Earl 's appointment ; and Sir Richard Varney the other , dying about the same time in London , cried miserably , and blasphemed God , and said to a person of note , -LRB- who hath related the same to others since , -RRB- not long before his death , that all the devils in hell did tear him in pieces . 
They exclaimed at once , in tones of resentment and surprise , the one `` Varney ! '' 
`` Nay , Varney , '' replied Tressilian , `` what make you here ? 
Tressilian drew his sword as he spoke , but Varney only laid his hand on the hilt of his own , as he replied , `` Thou art mad , Tressilian -- I own appearances are against me , but by every oath a priest can make , or a man can swear , Mistress Amy Robsart hath had no injury from me ; and in truth I were somewhat loath to hurt you in this cause -- Thou know ` st I can fight . '' 
`` I have heard thee say so , Varney , '' replied Tressilian ; `` but now , methinks , I would fain have some better evidence than thine own word . '' 
`` That shall not be lacking , if blade and hilt be but true to me , '' answered Varney ; and drawing his sword with the right hand , he threw his cloak around his left , and attacked Tressilian with a vigour which , for a moment , seemed to give him the advantage of the combat . 
Tressilian added to a spirit determined on revenge , a hand and eye admirably well adapted to the use of the rapier ; so that Varney finding himself hard pressed in his turn , endeavoured to avail himself of his superior strength , by closing with his adversary . 
For this purpose , he hazarded the receiving one of Tressilian 's passes in his cloak , wrapt as it was around his arm , and ere his adversary could extricate his rapier thus entangled , he closed with him , shortening his own sword at the same time , with the purpose of dispatching him . 
Varney , in his ill-advised attempt , received a fall so sudden and violent , that this sword flew several paces from his hand , and ere he could recover his feet , that of his antagonist was pointed to his throat . 
And while Varney , too confused or too sullen to reply , made a sudden effort to arise , his adversary drew back his arm , and would have executed his threat , but that the blow was arrested by the grasp of Michael Lambourne , who , directed by the clashing of swords , had come up just in time to save the life of Varney . 
He spoke truth , for Varney had taken the opportunity to regain his weapon , and Tressilian perceived it was madness to press the quarrel farther against such odds . 
He took his purse from his side , and taking out two gold nobles , flung them to Lambourne ; `` There , caitiff , is thy morning wage -- thou shalt not say thou hast been my guide unhired . 
-- Varney , farewell -- we shall meet where there are none to come betwixt us . '' 
Varney seemed to want the inclination , or perhaps the power , -LRB- for his fall had been a severe one , -RRB- to follow his retreating enemy . 
But he glared darkly as he disappeared , and then addressed Lambourne ; `` Art thou a comrade of Foster 's , good fellow ? '' 
`` Begone , then , '' said Varney , sheathing his rapier ; and , turning his back on Michael Lambourne , he walked slowly towards the house . 
Lambourne stopped but an instant to gather the nobles which his late companion had flung towards him so unceremoniously , and muttered to himself , while he put them up in his purse along with the gratuity of Varney , `` I spoke to yonder gulls of Eldorado -- By Saint Anthony , there is no Eldorado for men of our stamp equal to bonny Old England ! 
it is but Richard Varney . '' 
`` Ay , madam , '' said Varney , entering and saluting the lady with a respectful obeisance , which she returned with a careless mixture of negligence and of displeasure , `` it is but Richard Varney ; but even the first grey cloud should be acceptable , when it lightens in the east , because it announces the approach of the blessed sun . '' 
Varney replied to the lady , that his lord purposed to attend her , and would have proceeded with some compliment , when , running to the door of the parlour , she called aloud , `` Janet -- Janet -- come to my tiring-room instantly . '' 
Then returning to Varney , she asked if her lord sent any farther commendations to her . 
`` May not my poor poniard serve , honoured madam , '' said Varney , presenting a small dagger of exquisite workmanship , which hung in his Turkey-leather sword-belt . 
`` No , sir , '' replied the lady , rejecting the instrument which he offered -- `` Steel poniard shall cut no true-love knot of mine . '' 
`` It has cut many , however , '' said Anthony Foster , half aside , and looking at Varney . 
`` She takes state on her already , '' said Varney , `` and distributes the favour of her presence , as if she were already the partner of his dignity . 
`` It is thine own fault , thou sullen uninventive companion , '' answered Varney , `` who know ` st no mode of control , save downright brute force . 
`` Hold thy superstitious tongue , '' answered Varney ; `` and while thou talk ` st of visiting , answer me , thou paltering knave , how came Tressilian to be at the postern-door ? '' 
demanded Varney . 
this is a courtlike requital of my service to you , Master Richard Varney , '' replied Foster . 
`` And did he , '' said Varney , `` being such a fellow as thyself , only lacking , I suppose , thy present humour of hypocrisy , which lies as thin over thy hard ruffianly heart as gold lacquer upon rusty iron -- did he , I say , bring the saintly , sighing Tressilian in his train ? '' 
we are both undone , '' said Varney . 
replied Varney ; `` that is a hint worth catching , and I will work upon it . 
thou shalt live as long as Methuselah , '' said Varney , `` and amass as much wealth as Solomon ; and thou shalt repent so devoutly , that thy repentance shall be more famous than thy villainy , -- and that is a bold word . 
answered Varney . 
They parted , and at the hour of noon , which was then that of dinner , they again met at their meal , Varney gaily dressed like a courtier of the time , and even Anthony Foster improved in appearance , as far as dress could amend an exterior so unfavourable . 
This alteration did not escape Varney . 
When the meal was finished , the cloth removed , and they were left to their private discourse -- `` Thou art gay as a goldfinch , Anthony , '' said Varney , looking at his host ; `` methinks , thou wilt whistle a jig anon -- but I crave your pardon , that would secure your ejection from the congregation of the zealous botchers , the pure-hearted weavers , and the sanctified bakers of Abingdon , who let their ovens cool while their brains get heated . '' 
`` Say what thou wilt , honest Tony , '' replied Varney ; `` for be it according to thine absurd faith , or according to thy most villainous practice , it can not choose but be rare matter to qualify this cup of Alicant . 
`` Oh , content you , good Master Anthony Foster , '' answered Varney ; `` he that flies at all manner of game must keep all kinds of hawks , both short and long-winged . 
`` Then , '' said Varney , going on without appearing to notice the interruption , `` he must have his lawyers -- deep subtle pioneers -- to draw his contracts , his pre-contracts , and his post-contracts , and to find the way to make the most of grants of church-lands , and commons , and licenses for monopoly -- And he must have physicians who can spice a cup or a caudle -- And he must have his cabalists , like Dee and Allan , for conjuring up the devil -- And he must have ruffling swordsmen , who would fight the devil when he is raised and at the wildest -- And above all , without prejudice to others , he must have such godly , innocent , puritanic souls as thou , honest Anthony , who defy Satan , and do his work at the same time . '' 
`` Tush , man , '' said Varney , `` never look at me with so sad a brow -- you trap me not -- nor am I in your power , as your weak brain may imagine , because I name to you freely the engines , the springs , the screws , the tackle , and braces , by which great men rise in stirring times . 
`` Thou art metaphorical , honest Anthony , '' replied Varney ; `` that velvet doublet hath made an oracle of thee -- we will have thee to Oxford to take the degrees in the arts . 
`` 'T is the better , good Anthony , '' answered Varney ; `` we must found our future fortunes on her good liking . '' 
`` Fear not her displeasure , man , '' said Varney . 
`` She should consider , '' said Varney , smiling , `` the true faith I owed my lord and master prevented me at first from counselling marriage -- and yet I did counsel marriage when I saw she would not be satisfied without the -- the sacrament , or the ceremony -- which callest thou it , Anthony ? '' 
`` Very natural , very right , '' answered Varney ; `` but what have I to do with that ? 
`` She must love us better ere she leave this place , Anthony , '' answered Varney . 
-- `` Now , have done with these busy fingers , Janet , '' she said to her handmaiden , who was still officiously employed in bringing her hair and her dress into order -- `` Have done , I say -- I must see your father ere my lord arrives , and also Master Richard Varney , whom my lord has highly in his esteem -- but I could tell that of him would lose him favour . '' 
replied Janet ; `` leave him to God , who punishes the wicked in his own time ; but do not you cross Varney 's path , for so thoroughly hath he my lord 's ear , that few have thriven who have thwarted his courses . '' 
said the Countess ; `` or why should I keep terms with so mean a gentleman as Varney , being , as I am , wife to his master and patron ? '' 
`` Nay , madam , '' replied Janet Foster , `` your ladyship knows better than I -- But I have heard my father say , he would rather cross a hungry wolf , than thwart Richard Varney in his projects -- And he has often charged me to have a care of holding commerce with him . '' 
Why , even you , my lady , both trembled and blushed when Varney brought the letter from my lord . '' 
-- Call thy father hither , and call Varney also -- I cherish resentment against neither ; and though I may have some room to be displeased with both , it shall be their own fault if ever a complaint against them reaches the Earl through my means . 
Janet Foster obeyed her mistress ; and in a few minutes after , Varney entered the withdrawing-room with the graceful ease and unclouded front of an accomplished courtier , skilled , under the veil of external politeness , to disguise his own feelings , and to penetrate those of others . 
Varney , who , in right of his gentle blood , had pressed into the room before Anthony Foster , knew better what to say than he , and said it with more assurance and a better grace . 
She rose from her seat , and advanced two steps towards him , holding forth her hand as she said , `` Master Richard Varney , you brought me this morning such welcome tidings , that I fear surprise and joy made me neglect my lord and husband 's charge to receive you with distinction . 
`` I am unworthy to touch it , '' said Varney , dropping on one knee , `` save as a subject honours that of a prince . '' 
He touched with his lips those fair and slender fingers , so richly loaded with rings and jewels ; then rising , with graceful gallantry , was about to hand her to the chair of state , when she said , `` No , good Master Richard Varney , I take not my place there until my lord himself conducts me . 
I am for the present but a disguised Countess , and will not take dignity on me until authorized by him whom I derive it from . '' 
`` Ay , lady , '' said Foster , `` it hath cost many a fair crown ; and that more need not be wasted than is absolutely necessary , I leave you till my lord 's arrival with good Master Richard Varney , who , as I think , hath somewhat to say to you from your most noble lord and husband . 
`` No , Master Foster , '' said the Countess , `` we will your daughter remains here in our apartment ; out of ear-shot , however , in case Varney hath aught to say to me from my lord . '' 
When he was gone , his daughter took her embroidery frame , and went to establish herself at the bottom of the apartment , while Richard Varney , with a profoundly humble courtesy , took the lowest stool he could find , and placing it by the side of the pile of cushions on which the Countess had now again seated herself , sat with his eyes for a time fixed on the ground , and in profound silence . 
`` I thought , Master Varney , '' said the Countess , when she saw he was not likely to open the conversation , `` that you had something to communicate from my lord and husband ; so at least I understood Master Foster , and therefore I removed my waiting-maid . 
`` Lady , '' said Varney , `` Foster was partly mistaken in my purpose . 
`` Briefly then , madam , '' replied Varney , `` and boldly , for my argument requires both haste and courage -- You have this day seen Tressilian ? '' 
`` Nothing that concerns me , lady , '' Varney replied with humility . 
answered Varney . 
`` I crave your pardon , madam , '' said Varney , `` I meant the gentleman no injustice -- I knew not how nearly his cause affected you . 
`` Believe me they are , madam , '' answered Varney ; `` I pretend not to be a champion of that same naked virtue called truth , to the very outrance . 
`` True , madam , '' said Varney , smiling , `` and though you speak now in jest , it will not be amiss that in earnest your present speech had some connexion with your real purpose . 
`` And with the same openness , '' said Varney , `` your ladyship will this night tell my noble lord your husband , that Tressilian has discovered your place of residence , so anxiously concealed from the world , and that he has had an interview with you ? '' 
`` Your ladyship will do your pleasure , '' answered Varney ; `` but methinks it were as well , since nothing calls for so frank a disclosure , to spare yourself this pain , and my noble lord the disquiet , and Master Tressilian , since belike he must be thought of in the matter , the danger which is like to ensue . '' 
`` Far be it from me to do so , '' said Varney . 
-- And then , after a moment 's silence , he added , with a real or affected plainness of manner , very different from his usual smooth courtesy -- `` Come , madam , I will show you that a courtier dare speak truth as well as another , when it concerns the weal of those whom he honours and regards , ay , and although it may infer his own danger . '' 
-- He waited as if to receive commands , or at least permission , to go on , but as the lady remained silent , he proceeded , but obviously with caution . 
-- `` Look around you , '' he said , `` noble lady , and observe the barriers with which this place is surrounded , the studious mystery with which the brightest jewel that England possesses is secluded from the admiring gaze . 
`` His pleasure it is indeed , '' said Varney ; `` and his pleasure arises out of a love worthy of the object which inspires it . 
said Varney . 
`` I am mute , madam , '' answered Varney ; `` and as I have no reason to grieve for Tressilian , who would have my heart 's blood were he able , I shall reconcile myself easily to what may befall the gentleman , in consequence of your frank disclosure of his having presumed to intrude upon your solitude . 
-- No , no , Varney , urge it no more . 
`` Your judgment , madam , '' said Varney , `` is far superior to mine , especially as you may , if you will , prove the ice before you step on it , by mentioning Tressilian 's name to my lord , and observing how he endures it . 
The lady paused for an instant , and then replied , `` If , Varney , it be indeed true that Foster knows not as yet that the man he saw was Tressilian , I own I were unwilling he should learn what nowise concerns him . 
`` Tush , '' said Varney , `` what has the surly groom to do with your ladyship 's concerns ? 
`` I can not think it is he , '' said Varney ; `` or that you can hear the tread of his horse through the closely mantled casements . '' 
`` Stop me not , Varney -- my ears are keener than thine -- it is he ! '' 
exclaimed Varney , anxiously , and still placing himself in her way -- `` I trust that what I have spoken in humble duty and service , will not be turned to my ruin ? 
There was some little displeasure and confusion on the Countess 's brow , owing to her struggle with Varney 's pertinacity ; but it was exchanged for an expression of the purest joy and affection , as she threw herself into the arms of the noble stranger who entered , and clasping him to her bosom , exclaimed , `` At length -- at length thou art come ! '' 
Varney discreetly withdrew as his lord entered , and Janet was about to do the same , when her mistress signed to her to remain . 
`` Foster is , I note , somewhat sullen of mood , but Varney warrants to me his fidelity and devotion to my service . 
If thou hast aught , however , to complain of the mode in which he discharges his duty , he shall abye it . '' 
`` O , I have nought to complain of , '' answered the lady , `` so he discharges his task with fidelity to you ; and his daughter Janet is the kindest and best companion of my solitude -- her little air of precision sits so well upon her ! '' 
`` What you do ever must have so , my sweet Amy , '' replied her husband ; `` and I am the better pleased thou hast done them this grace , because Richard Varney is my sworn man , and a close brother of my secret council ; and for the present , I must needs repose much trust in this Anthony Foster . '' 
So saying he led his lovely wife into the next apartment , where Varney and Foster received them with the deepest reverences , which the first paid after the fashion of the court , and the second after that of the congregation . 
The Earl and his lady occupied the upper end of the table , and Varney and Foster sat beneath the salt , as was the custom with inferiors . 
The latter , overawed perhaps by society to which he was altogether unused , did not utter a single syllable during the repast ; while Varney , with great tact and discernment , sustained just so much of the conversation , as , without the appearance of intrusion on his part , prevented it from languishing , and maintained the good-humour of the Earl at the highest pitch . 
Early on the ensuing morning , Varney acted as the Earl 's chamberlain as well as his master of horse , though the latter was his proper office in that magnificent household , where knights and gentlemen of good descent were well contented to hold such menial situations , as nobles themselves held in that of the sovereign . 
The duties of each of these charges were familiar to Varney , who , sprung from an ancient but somewhat decayed family , was the Earl 's page during his earlier and more obscure fortunes , and , faithful to him in adversity , had afterwards contrived to render himself no less useful to him in his rapid and splendid advance to fortune ; thus establishing in him an interest resting both on present and past services , which rendered him an almost indispensable sharer of his confidence . 
`` Help me to do on a plainer riding-suit , Varney , '' said the Earl , as he laid aside his morning-gown , flowered with silk , and lined with sables , `` and put these chains and fetters there '' -LRB- pointing to the collars of the various Orders which lay on the table -RRB- `` into their place of security -- my neck last night was wellnigh broke with the weight of them . 
How think ` st thou , Varney ? '' 
`` For all that , Varney , '' replied his master , `` I am wellnigh resolved they shall bind me to the court no longer . 
`` And gather cockle-shells , with Dan Cupid to aid you , '' said Varney . 
`` How mean you by that , Varney ? '' 
`` Nay , my lord , '' said Varney , `` be not angry with me . 
said Varney ; `` surely I have no cause to regret your lordship 's retreat ! 
-- It will not be Richard Varney who will incur the displeasure of majesty , and the ridicule of the court , when the stateliest fabric that ever was founded upon a prince 's favour melts away like a morning frost-work . 
`` Speak on , then , Varney , '' said the Earl ; `` I tell thee I have determined nothing , and will weigh all considerations on either side . '' 
`` Well , then , my lord , '' replied Varney , `` we will suppose the step taken , the frown frowned , the laugh laughed , and the moan moaned . 
Well ; the late prime favourite of England , who wielded her general 's staff and controlled her parliaments , is now a rural baron , hunting , hawking , drinking fat ale with country esquires , and mustering his men at the command of the High Sheriff '' -- `` Varney , forbear ! '' 
`` I say , Varney , '' said the Earl , `` no more of this . 
Bear witness to me , Varney ; I subdue my wishes of retirement , not because I am moved by the call of private ambition , but that I may preserve the position in which I may best serve my country at the hour of need . 
-- Thou shalt be master for the day , Varney -- neglect nothing that can blind suspicion . 
`` I am glad thou art gone , '' thought Varney , `` or , practised as I am in the follies of mankind , I had laughed in the very face of thee ! 
But of thine old bauble , ambition , thou shalt not tire , for as you climb the hill , my lord , you must drag Richard Varney up with you ; and if he can urge you to the ascent he means to profit by , believe me he will spare neither whip nor spur . 
So saying , he left the apartment . 
Did not Varney convey to Sir Hugh all we dare at present tell him concerning your happiness and welfare ? 
and has he not told you that the good old knight was following , with good heart and health , his favourite and wonted exercise ? 
At the bottom of the staircase he received from Varney an ample livery cloak and slouched hat , in which he wrapped himself so as to disguise his person , and completely conceal his features . 
Horses were ready in the court-yard for himself and Varney ; -- for one or two of his train , intrusted with the secret so far as to know or guess that the Earl intrigued with a beautiful lady at that mansion , though her name and quality were unknown to them , had already been dismissed over night . 
Anthony Foster himself had in hand the rein of the Earl 's palfrey , a stout and able nag for the road ; while his old serving-man held the bridle of the more showy and gallant steed which Richard Varney was to occupy in the character of master . 
As the Earl approached , however , Varney advanced to hold his master 's bridle , and to prevent Foster from paying that duty to the Earl , which he probably considered as belonging to his own office . 
Foster scowled at an interference which seemed intended to prevent his paying his court to his patron , but gave place to Varney ; and the Earl , mounting without farther observation , and forgetting that his assumed character of a domestic threw him into the rear of his supposed master , rode pensively out of the quadrangle , not without waving his hand repeatedly in answer to the signals which were made by the Countess with her kerchief , from the windows of her apartment . 
While his stately form vanished under the dark arc hway which led out of the quadrangle , Varney muttered , `` There goes fine policy -- the servant before the master ! '' 
then as he disappeared , seized the moment to speak a word with Foster . 
`` Ay , or give it to thy keeping , Tony , which will serve as well , '' answered Varney ; `` but I have that to say which is more serious . 
`` Thou art like enough to be so , Tony , '' answered Varney ; `` but I think the devil will give thee little credit for thy compelled poverty , and so thou losest on all hands . 
replied Varney ; `` in my lord 's present humour it were the ready way to confirm him in his resolution of retirement , should he know that his lady was haunted with such a spectre in his absence . 
He turned his horse , struck him with the spurs , and rode off under the archway in pursuit of his lord . 
Varney , meantime , spurred after his lord , whom he found waiting for him at the postern-gate of the park . 
`` You waste time , Varney , '' said the Earl ; `` and it presses . 
`` It is but two hours ' brisk riding , my lord , '' said Varney ; `` for me , I only stopped to enforce your commands of care and secrecy on yonder Foster , and to enquire about the abode of the gentleman whom I would promote to your lordship 's train , in the room of Trevors . '' 
`` He promises well , my lord , '' replied Varney ; `` but if your lordship were pleased to ride on , I could go back to Cumnor , and bring him to your lordship at Woodstock before you are out of bed . '' 
So saying , he gave his horse the spur , and proceeded on his journey , while Varney rode back to Cumnor by the public road , avoiding the park . 
`` Thou hast lost the scent , '' said Varney , `` of thy comrade Tressilain . 
`` This sounds like practice upon me , sir , '' replied Varney ; `` and if it prove so , by my soul you shall repent it ! '' 
Varney did , in fact , make some enquiry among the household , which confirmed the truth of Lambourne 's statement . 
Thus satisfied of the rectitude of Lambourne 's conduct , Varney began to talk to him upon his future prospects , and the mode in which he meant to bestow himself , intimating that he understood from Foster , he was not disinclined to enter into the household of a nobleman . 
`` Have you , '' said he , `` ever been at court ? '' 
`` It may be your own fault if your dream comes not true , '' said Varney . 
`` That is a sufficient answer , and an honest one , '' said Varney . 
`` And thine , I suppose , '' said Varney , `` has had its edge blunted long since ? '' 
`` Thou mayst do me , and my lord , and thyself , good service , '' said Varney , after a pause . 
`` To thy other virtues thou canst add , no doubt , '' said Varney , in a jeering tone , `` the knack of seeming serious and religious , when the moment demands it ? '' 
`` Well , '' replied Varney , `` if thou hast no hypocrisy , hast thou not a nag here in the stable ? '' 
`` Saddle him then , instantly , and attend me , '' said Varney . 
`` Let me look at this Cicely of thine , mine host , '' said Varney ; `` I have heard much talk of her beauty . '' 
`` Well , peace be with her , my good host , '' answered Varney ; `` our horses are impatient -- we bid you good day . '' 
`` Ay , such is his purpose , '' answered Richard Varney . 
`` You are contented , then , '' said Varney to his companion , `` to take court service ? '' 
demanded Varney . 
`` Ay , '' said Varney , `` so they lie not so grossly open that he must needs break his shins over them . '' 
`` That is but reason , '' replied Varney , `` so that your betters are served before you . '' 
`` Reason again , '' said Varney , `` if the quarrel hath happened in your master 's service . '' 
`` Never fear , '' said Varney ; `` thou shalt have clothes and spending money to ruffle it with the best of thy degree , for thou goest to a household where you have gold , as they say , by the eye . '' 
`` My name is Master Richard Varney , '' answered his companion . 
said Varney , hastily ; `` I would have thee bold to others , but not saucy to me . '' 
`` Thou art a shrewd knave , I see , '' replied Varney . 
`` Used with discretion , it may prove so , '' replied Varney ; `` but mark -- if thou conjure with it at thine own hand , it may raise a devil who will tear thee in fragments . '' 
Varney and Lambourne galloped without ceremony into the court-yard of the ancient and dilapidated mansion , which presented on that morning a scene of bustle which it had not exhibited for two reigns . 
Their attention was excited by the hasty arrival of Varney , and a murmur ran amongst them , `` The Earl 's master of the horse ! '' 
said Varney , haughtily , `` and let the domestics do their office . '' 
While they gave their nags to the attendants of the household , and walked into the mansion with an air of superiority which long practice and consciousness of birth rendered natural to Varney , and which Lambourne endeavoured to imitate as well as he could , the poor inhabitants of Woodstock whispered to each other , `` Well-a-day -- God save us from all such misproud princoxes ! 
Meanwhile , Varney , closely followed by his new dependent , made his way to the hall , where men of more note and consequence than those left in the court-yard awaited the appearance of the Earl , who as yet kept his chamber . 
All paid court to Varney , with more or less deference , as suited their own rank , or the urgency of the business which brought them to his lord 's levee . 
he gave brief answers , as , `` See you not my boots ? 
Varney , therefore , bowed to the company , and took leave , to enter his lord 's apartment . 
There was a murmur of expectation which lasted a few minutes , and was at length hushed by the opening of the folding-doors at the upper end of the apartment , through which the Earl made his entrance , marshalled by his chamberlain and the steward of his family , and followed by Richard Varney . 
In his noble mien and princely features , men read nothing of that insolence which was practised by his dependents . 
His courtesies were , indeed , measured by the rank of those to whom they were addressed , but even the meanest person present had a share of his gracious notice . 
The enquiries which he made respecting the condition of the manor , of the Queen 's rights there , and of the advantages and disadvantages which might attend her occasional residence at the royal seat of Woodstock , seemed to show that he had most earnestly investigated the matter of the petition of the inhabitants , and with a desire to forward the interest of the place . 
The freedom of the corporation was presented to the Earl upon knee by the magistrates of the place , together with a purse of gold pieces , which the Earl handed to Varney , who , on his part , gave a share to Lambourne , as the most acceptable earnest of his new service . 
as Varney and Lambourne , each in his rank , rode proudly through the streets of Woodstock . 
It will be recollected that this gentleman , after his rencounter with Varney , had returned to Giles Gosling 's caravansary , where he shut himself up in his own chamber , demanded pen , ink , and paper , and announced his purpose to remain private for the day : in the evening he appeared again in the public room , where Michael Lambourne , who had been on the watch for him , agreeably to his engagement to Varney , endeavoured to renew his acquaintance with him , and hoped he retained no unfriendly recollection of the part he had taken in the morning 's scuffle . 
He remained moody and silent in a corner of the apartment , paying the most marked attention to every motion of his late companion , against whom he began now to nourish a quarrel on his own account , which he trusted to avenge by the execution of his new master Varney 's directions . 
`` You mean Master Richard Varney , do you not ? '' 
said the landlord ; `` he was at Cumnor-Place yesterday , and came not thither so private but what he was espied by one who told me . '' 
This Varney is the protector and patron of Anthony Foster , who holds under him , and by his favour , some lease of yonder mansion and the park . 
Varney got a large grant of the lands of the Abbacy of Abingdon , and Cumnor-Place amongst others , from his master , the Earl of Leicester . 
Men say he can do every thing with him , though I hold the Earl too good a nobleman to employ him as some men talk of . 
`` Richard Varney -- why , what between his influence with my lord , and his pretending to so many old and vexatious claims in right of the Abbot here , men fear almost to mention his name , much more to set themselves against his practices . 
Men said their pleasure of Tony Foster , but not a word of Richard Varney , though all men judge him to be at the bottom of yonder mystery about the pretty wench . 
During this period , Richard Varney appeared in the country , and , availing himself of some distant family connexion with Sir Hugh Robsart , spent much of his time in his company , until , at length , he almost lived in the family . '' 
For a time Amy Robsart received the attentions of this man Varney with the indifference attached to common courtesies ; then followed a period in which she seemed to regard him with dislike , and even with disgust ; and then an extraordinary species of connexion appeared to grow up betwixt them . 
Varney dropped those airs of pretension and gallantry which had marked his former approaches ; and Amy , on the other hand , seemed to renounce the ill-disguised disgust with which she had regarded them . 
She vanished from her father 's house -- Varney disappeared at the same time -- and this very day I have seen her in the character of his paramour , living in the house of his sordid dependent Foster , and visited by him , muffled , and by a secret entrance . '' 
`` The last is the better chosen word , mine host , '' answered Tressilian ; `` and touching your question , the knowledge that Varney held large grants of the demesnes formerly belonging to the Monks of Abingdon , directed me to this neighbourhood ; and your nephew 's visit to his old comrade Foster , gave me the means of conviction on the subject . '' 
`` Should Leicester , '' said the landlord , `` be disposed to protect his dependent , -LRB- as indeed he is said to be very confidential with Varney , -RRB- the appeal to the Queen may bring them both to reason . 
for if thou layest a petition from Sir Hugh at the foot of the throne , bucklered by the story of thine own wrongs , the favourite Earl dared as soon leap into the Thames at the fullest and deepest , as offer to protect Varney in a cause of this nature . 
`` Well , sir , '' said the host , `` these are brave words ; and I do pity from my soul the frank-hearted old gentleman , who has minished his estate in good house-keeping for the honour of his country , and now has his daughter , who should be the stay of his age , and so forth , whisked up by such a kite as this Varney . 
Varney has interest enough with the justices to dismount my noble emblem from the post on which he swings so gallantly , to call in my license , and ruin me from garret to cellar . '' 
`` At court , Richard ! 
But if ever I have that Varney within reach of a flight-shot , I will bestow a forked shaft on him ; and that I swear by salt and bread . '' 
It is honour enough for the daughter of an old De ` nshire clown to be the leman of a gay courtier , -- of Varney too , -- of Varney , whose grandsire was relieved by my father , when his fortune was broken , at the battle of -- the battle of -- where Richard was slain -- out on my memory ! 
-- and I warrant none of you will help me '' -- `` The battle of Bosworth , '' said Master Mumblazen , `` stricken between Richard Crookback and Henry Tudor , grandsire of the Queen that now is , Primo Henrici Septimi ; and in the year one thousand four hundred and eighty-five , post Christum natum . '' 
`` There , '' said Tressilian , `` this unhappy maiden resides , in company with the villain Varney . 
But for a strange mishap , my sword had revenged all our injuries , as well as hers , on his worthless head . '' 
It were better study to free her from the villain 's nets of infamy . '' 
He is as absolute in his household as the Queen in her kingdom , and if he expresses to Varney that such is his pleasure , her honour will not stand so publicly committed . '' 
`` I once came on them by chance , '' said the priest , `` in the South wood , in a spring evening -- Varney was muffled in a russet cloak , so that I saw not his face , -- they separated hastily , as they heard me rustle amongst the leaves , and I observed she turned her head and looked long after him . '' 
`` With neck reguardant , '' said the herald -- `` and on the day of her flight , and that was on Saint Austen 's Eve , I saw Varney 's groom , attired in his liveries , hold his master 's horse and Mistress Amy 's palfrey , bridled and saddled proper , behind the wall of the churchyard . '' 
`` And now is she found mewed up in his secret place of retirement , '' said Tressilian . 
`` He is too hot , '' said the Curate ; `` and I pray to God that he may grant him the patience to deal with Varney as is fitting . '' 
`` Patience and Varney , '' said Mumblazen , `` is worse heraldry than metal upon metal . 
He is more false than a siren , more rapacious than a griffin , more poisonous than a wyvern , and more cruel than a lion rampant . '' 
`` My worthy friend , '' he said , `` such support as I can give your accusation of Varney , you have a right to expect , alike from justice and gratitude . 
`` I am ordered to attend court to-morrow , '' said Leicester , speaking to Varney , `` to meet , as they surmise , my Lord of Sussex . 
`` I maintain it was nothing , '' said Varney ; `` nay , I know from a sure intelligencer , who was within ear-shot of much that was said , that Sussex has lost rather than gained by that visit . 
`` She took him up roundly , '' said Varney , `` and asked what my Lord Sussex had to do with a wife , or my Lord Bishop to speak on such a subject . 
`` Nor among courtiers neither , '' said Varney ; but , observing that Leicester changed countenance , he instantly added , `` that all the ladies who were present had joined in ridiculing Lord Sussex 's housekeeping , and in contrasting it with the reception her Grace would have assuredly received at my Lord of Leicester 's . '' 
`` Your lordship meaneth that Raleigh , the Devonshire youth , '' said Varney , `` the Knight of the Cloak , as they call him at court ? '' 
`` My lord , '' replied Varney , `` there will be rubs in the smoothest road , specially when it leads up hill . 
`` No , my lord , '' said Varney ; `` but it has betrayed you right often . 
`` Thy Supplication , impeaching Varney of seduction , '' said the Earl to Tressilian , `` is by this time in the Queen 's hand -- I have sent it through a sure channel . 
Both Earls moved slowly and stately towards the entrance ; Sussex followed by Tressilian , Blount , and Raleigh , and Leicester by Varney . 
The pride of Leicester was obliged to give way to court-forms , and with a grave and formal inclination of the head , he paused until his rival , a peer of older creation than his own , passed before him . 
`` Follow me close , Varney , '' said the Earl of Leicester , who had stood aloof for a moment to mark the reception of Sussex ; and , advancing to the entrance , he was about to pass on , when Varney , who was close behind him , dressed out in the utmost bravery of the day , was stopped by the usher , as Tressilian and Blount had been before him . 
-- My Lord of Leicester , you have a gentleman in your household , called Varney ? '' 
`` Yes , gracious madam , '' replied Leicester , `` I presented him to kiss your royal hand when you were last at Nonsuch . '' 
`` His outside was well enough , '' said the Queen , `` but scarce so fair , I should have thought , as to have caused a maiden of honourable birth and hopes to barter her fame for his good looks , and become his paramour . 
Where is this Varney ? 
Who saw him ? '' 
repeated Elizabeth , sharply , not at that moment in the humour of being pleased with any thing , -- `` It does not please me that he should pass saucily into my presence , or that you should exclude from it one who came to justify himself from an accusation . '' 
Call this Varney hither instantly -- there is one Tressilian also mentioned in this petition -- let them both come before us . '' 
She was obeyed , and Tressilian and Varney appeared accordingly . 
Varney 's first glance was at Leicester , his second at the Queen . 
In the looks of the latter , there appeared an approaching storm , and in the downcast countenance of his patron , he could read no directions in what way he was to trim his vessel for the encounter -- he then saw Tressilian , and at once perceived the peril of the situation in which he was placed . 
But Varney was as bold-faced and ready-witted as he was cunning and unscrupulous , -- a skilful pilot in extremity , and fully conscious of the advantages which he would obtain , could he extricate Leicester from his present peril , and of the ruin that yawned for himself , should he fail in doing so . 
Varney kneeled down , and replied , with a look of the most profound contrition , `` There had been some love passages betwixt him and Mistress Amy Robsart . '' 
Leicester 's flesh quivered with indignation as he heard his dependent make this avowal , and for one moment he manned himself to step forward , and , bidding farewell to the court and the royal favour , confess the whole mystery of the secret marriage . 
And pressing his lips close together , he stood firm and collected , attentive to each word which Varney uttered , and determined to hide to the last the secret on which his court-favour seemed to depend . 
Meanwhile , the Queen proceeded in her examination of Varney . 
`` An it please your Grace , '' said Varney , still on his knees , `` I dared not do so , for her father had promised her hand to a gentleman of birth and honour -- I will do him justice , though I know he bears me ill will -- one Master Edmund Tressilian , whom I now see in the presence . '' 
`` Madam , '' replied Varney , `` it is in vain to plead the cause of human frailty before a judge to whom it is unknown , or that of love , to one who never yields to the passion '' -- He paused an instant , and then added , in a very low and timid tone , `` which she inflicts upon all others . '' 
Leicester 's feelings became so complicated and so painfully intense , that it seemed to him as if his life was to depend on the answer made by Varney , who , after a moment 's real hesitation , answered , `` Yes . '' 
said Leicester , bursting forth into rage , yet unable to add another word to the sentence , which he had begun with such emphatic passion . 
`` Gracious madam , '' said Varney , `` to speak Heaven 's truth , my lord was the cause of the whole matter . '' 
`` Speak on , '' said the Queen , hastily , her cheek colouring , and her eyes sparkling , as she addressed Varney ; `` speak on -- here no commands are heard but mine . '' 
`` They are omnipotent , gracious madam , '' replied Varney ; `` and to you there can be no secrets . 
-- Yet I would not , '' he added , looking around him , `` speak of my master 's concerns to other ears . '' 
`` Far be it from me to traduce my noble patron , '' replied Varney ; `` yet I am compelled to own that some deep , overwhelming , yet secret feeling , hath of late dwelt in my lord 's mind , hath abstracted him from the cares of the household , which he was wont to govern with such religious strictness , and hath left us opportunities to do follies , of which the shame , as in this case , partly falls upon our patron . 
`` Surely , madam , in no other , '' replied Varney ; `` but since somewhat hath chanced to him , he can scarce be called his own man . 
Varney replied , `` A poet , madam , might call it a thread from the golden web wrought by Minerva ; but , to my thinking , it was paler than even the purest gold -- more like the last parting sunbeam of the softest day of spring . '' 
Varney looked round the presence-chamber , his eye travelling from one lady to another , until at length it rested upon the Queen herself , but with an aspect of the deepest veneration . 
`` I see no tresses , '' he said , `` in this presence , worthy of such similies , unless where I dare not look on them . '' 
`` How , sir knave , '' said the Queen , `` dare you intimate '' -- `` Nay , madam , '' replied Varney , shading his eyes with his hand , `` it was the beams of the Mayday sun that dazzled my weak eyes . '' 
`` Go to -- go to , '' said the Queen ; `` thou art a foolish fellow '' -- and turning quickly from him she walked up to Leicester . 
Intense curiosity , mingled with all the various hopes , fears , and passions , which influence court-faction , had occupied the presence-chamber during the Queen 's conference with Varney , as if with the strength of an Eastern talisman . 
The atmosphere was contagious , and Leicester , who saw all around wishing or fearing his advancement or his fall , forgot all that love had previously dictated , and saw nothing for the instant but the favour or disgrace , which depended on the nod of Elizabeth and the fidelity of Varney . 
He summoned himself hastily , and prepared to play his part in the scene which was like to ensue , when , as he judged from the glances which the Queen threw towards him , Varney 's communications , be they what they might , were operating in his favour . 
Elizabeth did not long leave him in doubt ; for the more than favour with which she accosted him decided his triumph in the eyes of his rival , and of the assembled court of England -- `` Thou hast a prating servant of this same Varney , my lord , '' she said ; `` it is lucky you trust him with nothing that can hurt you in our opinion , for believe me , he would keep no counsel . '' 
`` From your Highness , '' said Leicester , dropping gracefully on one knee , `` it were treason he should . 
`` What , my lord , '' said Elizabeth , looking kindly upon him , `` is there no one little corner over which you would wish to spread a veil ? 
Leicester 's first use of the familiarity to which the Queen had so publicly restored him , was to ask her commands concerning Varney 's offence . 
`` Although , '' he said , `` the fellow deserves nothing from me but displeasure , yet , might I presume to intercede '' -- `` In truth , we had forgotten his matter , '' said the Queen ; `` and it was ill done of us , who owe justice to our meanest , as well as to our highest subject . 
His person , as we have elsewhere observed , had an air of grace and even of nobleness , which did not escape Queen Elizabeth 's critical observation . 
She looked at him with attention as he stood before her unabashed , but with an air of the deepest dejection . 
But Varney is a well-spoken fellow , and , to speak truth , that goes far with us of the weaker sex . 
-- She has made her election -- not a wise one perchance -- but she is Varney 's wedded wife . '' 
But I hold this Varney 's word no good warrant for the truth . '' 
`` Had that doubt been elsewhere urged , '' answered Varney , `` my sword '' -- `` Thy sword ! '' 
-- Look you , sirs , he that speaks of drawing swords in any other quarrel than mine or England 's , by mine honour , I 'll bracelet him with iron both on wrist and ankle ! '' 
Tressilian and Varney are near your persons -- you will see that they attend you at Kenilworth -- And as we shall then have both Paris and Menelaus within our call , so we will have the same fair Helen also , whose fickleness has caused this broil . 
-- Varney , thy wife must be at Kenilworth , and forthcoming at my order . 
`` It was impossible for him now , '' he thought , `` after having , in the face of all that was honourable in England , pledged his truth -LRB- though in an ambiguous phrase -RRB- for the statement of Varney , to contradict or disavow it , without exposing himself not merely to the loss of court-favour , but to the highest displeasure of the Queen , his deceived mistress , and to the scorn and contempt at once of his rival and of all his compeers . '' 
-- As he pursued this train of thought , the door of the apartment opened , and Varney rushed in . 
was his exclamation . 
`` Thank whom you will , my lord , '' said Varney ; `` but hasten to the water-side . 
`` I may well say so , '' said Varney , with bitterness of expression , `` for your place , ay , and mine , who , as your master of the horse , was to have attended your lordship , is already filled up in the Queen 's barge . 
`` Thou art a devil , Varney , '' said Leicester , hastily ; `` but thou hast the mastery for the present -- I follow thee . '' 
Varney replied not , but led the way out of the palace , and towards the river , while his master followed him , as if mechanically ; until , looking back , he said in a tone which savoured of familiarity at least , if not of authority , `` How is this , my lord ? 
-- your cloak hangs on one side , -- your hose are unbraced -- permit me '' -- `` Thou art a fool , Varney , as well as a knave , '' said Leicester , shaking him off , and rejecting his officious assistance ; `` we are best thus , sir -- when we require you to order our person , it is well , but now we want you not . '' 
So saying , the Earl resumed at once his air of command , and with it his self-possession -- shook his dress into yet wilder disorder -- passed before Varney with the air of a superior and master , and in his turn led the way to the river-side . 
said Elizabeth hastily , looking at Varney ; `` hath your lord been ill ? '' 
`` Something of a fainting fit , '' answered the ready-witted Varney , `` as your Grace may observe from his present condition . 
`` It matters not , '' said Elizabeth , as she gazed on the noble face and form of Leicester , to which even the strange mixture of passions by which he had been so lately agitated , gave additional interest , `` make room for my noble lord -- Your place , Master Varney , has been filled up ; you must find a seat in another barge . '' 
Varney bowed , and withdrew . 
Leicester seated himself in his place in the barge , and close to the Sovereign ; Raleigh rose to retire , and Tressilian would have been so ill-timed in his courtesy as to offer to relinquish his own place to his friend , had not the acute glance of Raleigh himself , who seemed now in his native element , made him sensible , that so ready a disclamation of the royal favour might be misinterpreted . 
The artist expressed himself willing to receive his commands , and Tressilian , knowing he was well acquainted with the outline of his business at court , frankly explained to him the whole , mentioned the agreement which subsisted betwixt Giles Gosling and him , and told what had that day been averred in the presence-chamber by Varney , and supported by Leicester . 
`` Thou seest , '' he added , `` that , in the circumstances in which I am placed , it behoves me to keep a narrow watch on the motions of these unprincipled men , Varney and his complices , Foster and Lambourne , as well as on those of my Lord Leicester himself , who , I suspect , is partly a deceiver , and not altogether the deceived in that matter . 
Varney , however , entered , accepting this signal as a permission , and the chamberlain withdrew . 
Varney waited for some minutes until he should speak , desirous to know what was the finally predominant mood of a mind , through which so many powerful emotions had that day taken their course . 
But he waited in vain , for Leicester continued still silent , and the confidant saw himself under the necessity of being the first to speak . 
Leicester raised his head , and answered sadly , but without anger , `` Thou , Varney , whose ready invention has involved me in a web of most mean and perilous falsehood , knowest best what small reason there is for gratulation on the subject . '' 
`` Do you blame me , my lord , '' said Varney , `` for not betraying , on the first push , the secret on which your fortunes depended , and which you have so oft and so earnestly recommended to my safe keeping ? 
`` I can not deny it , Varney , '' said the Earl , rising and walking across the room ; `` my own ambition has been traitor to my love . '' 
demanded Leicester ; `` speak out thy meaning , Varney . '' 
`` Of being yourself a KING , my lord , '' replied Varney ; `` and King of England to boot ! 
`` Thou ravest , Varney , '' answered Leicester . 
`` He ! '' 
said Varney ; `` a gull , a fool , a thrice sodden ass , who suffered himself to be fired off into the air like a rocket on a rejoicing day . 
`` It might have been as thou sayst , Varney , '' said Leicester , a brief smile of self-satisfaction passing over his anxious countenance . 
`` Henry Darnley knew little of women -- with Mary , a man who knew her sex might have had some chance of holding his own . 
But not with Elizabeth , Varney -- for I think God , when he gave her the heart of a woman , gave her the head of a man to control its follies . 
`` The better for you , my lord , '' said Varney , `` that is , in the case supposed , if such be her disposition ; since you think you can not aspire to become her husband . 
`` Ay , but , my lord , '' said Varney , `` is her desire reasonable ? 
`` Let me sleep on that hard point , '' said Varney ; `` I can not else perfect the device I have on the stithy , which I trust will satisfy the Queen and please my honoured lady , yet leave this fatal secret where it is now buried . 
Varney retired -- and the Earl , opening the window of his apartment , looked out long and anxiously upon the brilliant host of stars which glimmered in the splendour of a summer firmament . 
The words burst from him as at unawares -- `` I had never more need that the heavenly bodies should befriend me , for my earthly path is darkened and confused . '' 
It is well known that the age reposed a deep confidence in the vain predictions of judicial astrology , and Leicester , though exempt from the general control of superstition , was not in this respect superior to his time ; but , on the contrary , was remarkable for the encouragement which he gave to the professors of this pretended science . 
With heedful precaution to see that it had not been opened , or its locks tampered with , Leicester applied a key to the steel casket , and drew from it , first , a parcel of gold pieces , which he put into a silk purse ; then a parchment inscribed with planetary signs , and the lines and calculations used in framing horoscopes , on which he gazed intently for a few moments ; and , lastly , took forth a large key , which , lifting aside the tapestry , he applied to a little concealed door in the corner of the apartment , and , opening it , disclosed a stair constructed in the thickness of the wall . 
But hast thou again cast my horoscope as Varney directed thee , and art thou prepared to say what the stars tell of my present fortune ? '' 
`` Have thou double the recompense which Varney promised . 
-- Here , Varney -- conduct this venerable man to thine own lodging -- tend him heedfully in all things , but see that he holds communication with no one . '' 
Varney bowed , and the astrologer kissed the Earl 's hand in token of adieu , and followed the master of the horse to another apartment , in which were placed wine and refreshments for his use . 
The astrologer sat down to his repast , while Varney shut two doors with great precaution , examined the tapestry , lest any listener lurked behind it ; and then sitting down opposite to the sage , began to question him . 
`` I did , '' said Alasco , for by such name he was at present called , `` and shaped the horoscope accordingly . '' 
continued Varney . 
`` My lord 's fear will stand sponsor to the one , and his conscience to the other , of these prognostications , '' replied Varney . 
`` At your pleasure , '' said Varney , with a sneer which habit had rendered familiar to his features , and which forms the principal characteristic that painters have assigned to those of Satan -- `` At your pleasure , '' he said ; `` you may enjoy your liberty , and your studies , until the daggers of Sussex 's followers are clashing within your doublet , and against your ribs . '' 
The old man turned pale , and Varney proceeded . 
There are not six chemists in the world who possess so near an approximation to the grand arcanum '' -- `` Come , come , '' said Varney , interrupting him , `` what means this , in the name of Heaven ? 
`` Thou art an hardened villain , Varney , '' replied Alasco ; `` many will do those things , who dare not speak of them . '' 
`` And many speak of them who dare not do them , '' answered Varney ; `` but be not wroth -- I will not quarrel with thee -- If I did , I were fain to live on eggs for a month , that I might feed without fear . 
`` The Earl of Sussex 's horoscope intimates , '' replied the astrologer , `` that the sign of the ascendant being in combustion '' -- `` Away with your gibberish , '' replied Varney ; `` think ` st thou it is the patron thou speak ` st with ? '' 
`` There was some talk of a quack who waited on him , '' said Varney , after a moment 's reflection . 
`` Of a whole workshop , man , '' said Varney ; `` for a reverend father Abbot , who was fain to give place to bluff King Hal , and some of his courtiers , a score of years since , had a chemist 's complete apparatus , which he was obliged to leave behind him to his successors . 
`` Thou art right , Master Varney , '' said the alchymist , setting his teeth close , and grinding them together -- `` thou art right , even in thy very contempt of right and reason . 
my good father , '' said Varney , with the usual sardonic expression of ridicule on his countenance ; `` yet all this approximation to the philosopher 's stone wringeth not one single crown out of my Lord Leicester 's pouch , and far less out of Richard Varney 's -- We must have earthly and substantial services , man , and care not whom else thou canst delude with thy philosophica charlatanry . '' 
`` My son Varney , '' said the alchymist , `` the unbelief , gathered around thee like a frost-fog , hath dimmed thine acute perception to that which is a stumbling-block to the wise , and which yet , to him who seeketh knowledge with humility , extends a lesson so clear , that he who runs may read . 
`` I have heard all this before , '' said Varney , `` and my heart is proof against such cant ever since I sent twenty good gold pieces , -LRB- marry , it was in the nonage of my wit , -RRB- to advance the grand magisterium , all which , God help the while , vanished in fumo . 
said Varney , somewhat anxiously . 
`` Thou shalt regulate the whole , '' said Varney , `` thy reward shall be princely , if thou keep ` st time and touch , and exceedest not the due proportion , to the prejudice of her health -- otherwise thy punishment shall be as signal . '' 
`` No , thou fool , '' replied Varney ; `` said I not it was a bird -- a reclaimed linnet , whose pipe might soothe a hawk when in mid stoop ? 
`` It is so , '' answered Varney ; `` you understand women well , though it may have been long since you were conversant amongst them . 
`` On the contrary , we will have thee hanged if thou dost , '' replied Varney . 
-- At the door he turned round , and slowly repeated Varney 's question ere he answered it . 
`` For what do I take thee , Richard Varney ? 
`` Well , well , '' answered Varney , hastily , `` be stirring with grey light . 
The Earl of Leicester 's Italian physician , Julio , was affirmed by his contemporaries to be a skilful compounder of poisons , which he applied with such frequency , that the Jesuit Parsons extols ironically the marvellous good luck of this great favourite in the opportune deaths of those who stood in the way of his wishes . 
When Varney heard the adept 's door shut and carefully bolted within , he stepped towards it , and with similar precaution carefully locked it on the outside , and took the key from the lock , muttering to himself , `` Worse than thee , thou poisoning quacksalver and witch-monger , who , if thou art not a bounden slave to the devil , it is only because he disdains such an apprentice ! 
he called at another door , and Michael made his appearance , with a flushed cheek and an unsteady step . 
said Varney to him . 
`` Hark ye , scoundrel , '' said Varney , `` be sober on the instant -- I command thee . 
said Varney , sternly . 
`` Lambourne obeyed , and Varney , after rinsing his mouth with the liquor , drank a full cup , and said , as he took up a lamp to retreat to his sleeping apartment , `` It is strange -- I am as little the slave of fancy as any one , yet I never speak for a few minutes with this fellow Alasco , but my mouth and lungs feel as if soiled with the fumes of calcined arsenic -- pah ! '' 
`` Were it not for this accursed custom , '' he said , `` I might climb as high as Varney himself . 
But who can climb when the room turns round with him like a parish-top ? 
Thus , instead of a numerous household , to secure his charge , and defend his house , he studied , as much as possible , to elude notice , by diminishing his attendants ; so that , unless when there were followers of the Earl , or of Varney , in the mansion , one old male domestic , and two aged crones , who assisted in keeping the Countess 's apartments in order , were the only servants of the family . 
-- No , no , I will not drink with that poisoning devil within doors , to be choked with the fumes of arsenic and quicksilver ; I learned from villain Varney to beware of that . '' 
`` Fetch him wine , in the name of all the fiends ! '' 
Hand me the flask thyself , old Tony Fire-the-Fagot -- and let it be cool -- I will have no wine mulled at the pile of the old burnt bishops -- Or stay , let Leicester be king if he will -- good -- and Varney , villain Varney , grand vizier -- why , excellent ! 
-- Here , honest Lambourne , wilt thou pledge me to the health of the noble Earl of Leicester and Master Richard Varney ? '' 
-- Here goes it , up seyes -- to Varney and Leicester ! 
-- two more noble mounting spirits -- and more dark-seeking , deep-diving , high-flying , malicious , ambitious miscreants -- well , I say no more , but I will whet my dagger on his heart-spone , that refuses to pledge me ! 
From some words which Lambourne had dropped among his ravings , Wayland now , for the first time felt inclined to doubt that Varney had acted entirely on his own account in wooing and winning the affections of this beautiful creature . 
Fame asserted of this zealous retainer , that he had accommodated his lord in former love intrigues ; and it occurred to Wayland Smith , that Leicester himself might be the party chiefly interested . 
`` If Leicester himself should hesitate to stifle such a rumour by very strange means , '' said he to himself , `` he has those about him who would do him that favour without waiting for his consent . 
He would then pause , and call for Varney , whose advice was now more frequently resorted to than ever , because the Earl remembered the remonstraces which he had made against his secret contract . 
Show me thy device , Varney , for solving the inextricable difficulty . 
We would wish to see the woman who could postpone yonder poetical gentleman , Master Tressilian , to your man , Richard Varney . ' 
-- Now , Varney , ply thine invention , whose forge hath availed us so often ; for sure as my name is Dudley , the danger menaced by my horoscope is now darkening around me . '' 
said Varney , after some hesitation . 
my lord , '' answered Varney , `` and yet such is the quality in which Elizabeth now holds her ; and to contradict this opinion is to discover all . '' 
`` Think of something else , Varney , '' said the Earl , in great agitation ; `` this invention is naught -- If I could give way to it , she would not ; for I tell thee , Varney , if thou know ` st it not , that not Elizabeth on the throne has more pride than the daughter of this obscure gentleman of Devon . 
`` We have experienced that , my lord , else had we not been thus circumstanced , '' said Varney . 
`` It is impossible , '' said the Earl , waving his hand ; `` I know neither authority nor entreaties would make her endure thy name for an hour . '' 
`` It is somewhat hard , though , '' said Varney , in a dry tone ; and , without pausing on that topic , he added , `` Suppose some one were found to represent her ? 
`` Utter madness , Varney , '' answered the Earl ; `` the counterfeit would be confronted with Tressilian , and discovery become inevitable . '' 
`` Tressilian might be removed from court , '' said the unhesitating Varney . 
`` There are many , '' said Varney , `` by which a statesman in your situation , my lord , may remove from the scene one who pries into your affairs , and places himself in perilous opposition to you . '' 
`` Speak not to me of such policy , Varney , '' said the Earl , hastily ; `` which , besides , would avail nothing in the present case . 
`` My lord , I know not what to say , '' answered Varney ; `` but were I myself in such perplexity , I would ride post down to Cumnor Place , and compel my wife to give her consent to such measures as her safety and mine required . '' 
`` Varney , '' said Leicester , `` I can not urge her to aught so repugnant to her noble nature , as a share in this stratagem -- it would be a base requital for the love she bears me . '' 
`` Well , my lord , '' said Varney , `` your lordship is a wise and an honourable man , and skilled in those high points of romantic scruple , which are current in Arcadia , perhaps , as your nephew , Philip Sidney , writes . 
`` I tell thee , Varney , '' said the Earl , `` that all it was in my power to bestow upon her , was not merely deserved , but a thousand times overpaid , by her own virtue and beauty ; for never did greatness descend upon a creature so formed by nature to grace and adorn it . '' 
`` It is well , my lord , you are so satisfied , '' answered Varney , with his usual sardonic smile , which even respect to his patron could not at all times subdue -- `` you will have time enough to enjoy undisturbed the society of one so gracious and beautiful -- that is , so soon as such confinement in the Tower be over , as may correspond to the crime of deceiving the affections of Elizabeth Tudor -- A cheaper penalty , I presume , you do not expect . '' 
`` If you are serious , my lord , '' said Varney , `` you must set forth instantly , and post for Cumnor Place . '' 
`` Do thou go thyself , Varney ; the devil has given thee that sort of eloquence , which is most powerful in the worst cause . 
`` No , my lord , '' said Varney -- `` but if you are serious in intrusting me with the task of urging this most necessary measure , you must give me a letter to my lady , as my credentials , and trust to me for backing the advice it contains with all the force in my power . 
Leicester seized on writing materials , and twice or thrice commenced a letter to the Countess , which he afterwards tore into fragments . 
At length he finished a few distracted lines , in which he conjured her , for reasons nearly concerning his life and honour , to consent to bear the name of Varney for a few days , during the revels at Kenilworth . 
He added , that Varney would communicate all the reasons which rendered this deception indispensable ; and having signed and sealed these credentials , he flung them over the table to Varney , with a motion that he should depart , which his adviser was not slow to comprehend and to obey . 
Leicester remained like one stupified , till he heard the trampling of the horses , as Varney , who took no time even to change his dress , threw himself into the saddle , and , followed by a single servant , set off for Berkshire . 
But Varney was already beyond call -- and the bright starry firmament , which the age considered as the Book of Fate , lying spread before Leicester when he opened the casement , diverted him from his better and more manly purpose . 
And if this disdainful dame , as he termed the Countess , should comply with the request of her husband , Varney , her pretended husband , must needs become so situated with respect to her , that there was no knowing where his audacity might be bounded ; perhaps not till circumstances enabled him to obtain a triumph , which he thought of with a mixture of fiendish feelings , in which revenge for her previous scorn was foremost and predominant . 
`` I have made her Countess , '' he said to Varney ; `` surely she might wait till it consisted with my pleasure that she should put on the coronet ? '' 
Here was a `` Boke of Cookery , imprinted by Richard Lant , '' and `` Skelton 's Books '' -- '' The Passtime of the People '' -- '' The Castle of Knowledge , '' & c . 
There was a brief bustle in the mansion , and Foster , with his downward look and sullen manner , entered the apartment to say , `` That Master Richard Varney was arrived from my lord , having ridden all night , and craved to speak with her ladyship instantly . '' 
`` Varney ? '' 
-- But he comes with news from Leicester -- so admit him instantly . '' 
Varney entered her dressing-apartment , where she sat arrayed in her native loveliness , adorned with all that Janet 's art , and a rich and tasteful undress , could bestow . 
Varney entered the room in the dress in which he had waited on his master that morning to court , the splendour of which made a strange contrast with the disorder arising from hasty riding during a dark night and foul ways . 
His brow bore an anxious and hurried expression , as one who has that to say of which he doubts the reception , and who hath yet posted on from the necessity of communicating his tidings . 
said Varney . 
`` Madam , '' answered Varney , `` we are not alone , and my lord 's message was for your ear only . '' 
God forgive our sins ; but Varney 's sudden and strange arrival bodes us no good . '' 
she continued , drowning with her vehement accents the low and muttered sounds which Varney was heard to utter betwixt whiles . 
`` It shall not need , madam , '' Varney was at length distinctly heard to say . 
When they entered the apartment , Varney stood by the door grinding his teeth , with an expression in which rage , and shame , and fear , had each their share . 
Janet , as soon as the door was open , ran to her mistress ; and more slowly , yet with more haste than he was wont , Anthony Foster went to Richard Varney . 
-- nothing , '' answered Varney , but with sunken head and sullen voice ; `` nothing but communicated to her her lord 's commands , which , if the lady list not to obey , she knows better how to answer it than I may pretend to do . '' 
`` You have misapprehended me , lady , '' said Varney , with a sulky species of submission and apology ; `` let this matter rest till your passion be abated , and I will explain all . '' 
`` You hear her , Foster , and you , young maiden , hear this lady , '' answered Varney , taking advantage of the pause which the Countess had made in her charge , more for lack of breath than for lack of matter -- `` You hear that her heat only objects to me the course which our good lord , for the purpose to keep certain matters secret , suggests in the very letter which she holds in her hands . '' 
`` Bear witness , '' said Varney , collecting himself , `` she hath torn my lord 's letter , in order to burden me with the scheme of his devising ; and although it promises nought but danger and trouble to me , she would lay it to my charge , as if I had any purpose of mine own in it . '' 
`` Madam , '' said Varney , overwhelmed in spite of his effrontery , `` I entreat you to believe yourself mistaken . '' 
Varney left the room with a mute expression of rage , and was followed by Foster , whose apprehension , naturally slow , was overpowered by the eager and abundant discharge of indignation , which , for the first time , he had heard burst from the lips of a being , who had seemed till that moment too languid , and too gentle , to nurse an angry thought , or utter an intemperate expression . 
Foster , therefore , pursued Varney from place to place , persecuting him with interrogatories , to which the other replied not until they were in the opposite side of the quadrangle , and in the old library , with which the reader has already been made acquainted . 
`` Ay , he studies the devil 's divinity , '' said Varney , -- `` but when I want him , one hour must suffice as well as another . 
So spoke Varney , and with hasty and perturbed steps followed Foster , who conducted him through private passages , many of which were wellnigh ruinous , to the opposite side of the quadrangle , where , in a subterranean apartment , now occupied by the chemist Alasco , one of the Abbots of Abingdon , who had a turn for the occult sciences , had , much to the scandal of his convent , established a laboratory , in which , like other fools of the period , he spent much precious time , and money besides , in the pursuit of the grand arcanum . 
But Varney , less scrupulous , roused him , by knocking and voice , until at length , slowly and reluctantly , the inmate of the apartment undid the door . 
`` To the affairs of hell , '' answered Varney , `` for that is they proper element . 
Varney , following , barred the door , and they betook themselves to secret council . 
-- Janet , I will not remain here longer -- I fear him -- I fear thy father -- I grieve to say it , Janet -- but I fear thy father , and , worst of all , this odious Varney . 
said Varney , with half a smile ; while the astrologer put the same question with his eyes , but spoke not a word . 
`` Wert thou not told , thou sullen and yet faint-hearted slave , '' answered Varney , with bitterness , `` that no murder , as thou call ` st it , with that staring look and stammering tone , is designed in the matter ? 
`` An oath of force , '' said Varney . 
`` Ay , Tony , '' said Varney , `` that were a paradise to thy heart 's content . 
So speaking , Varney arose , and , taking the flask from the table , he left the room . 
`` I tell thee , my son , '' said Alasco to Foster , as soon as Varney had left them , `` that whatever this bold and profligate railer may say of the mighty science , in which , by Heaven 's blessing , I have advanced so far , that I would not call the wisest of living artists my better or my teacher -- I say , howsoever yonder reprobate may scoff at things too holy to be apprehended by men merely of carnal and evil thoughts , yet believe , that the city beheld by St John , in that bright vision of the Christian Apocalypse , that New Jerusalem , of which all Christian men hope to partake , sets forth typically the discovery of the Grand Secret , whereby the most precious and perfect of nature 's works are elicited out of her basest and most crude productions ; just as the light and gaudy butterfly , the most beautiful child of the summer 's breeze , breaks forth from the dungeon of a sordid chrysalis . '' 
`` Stick to that , learned sage , '' said Varney , who at this moment entered the apartment ; `` if he refuse the testimony of thy tongue , yet how shall he deny that of his own eyes ? '' 
`` Varney ! '' 
said the adept -- `` Varney already returned ! 
Hast thou '' -- he stopped short . 
`` Have I done mine errand , thou wouldst say , '' replied Varney -- `` I have ! 
-- And thou , '' he added , showing more symptoms of interest than he had hitherto exhibited , `` art thou sure thou hast poured forth neither more nor less than the just measure ? '' 
`` Nay , then , '' said Varney , `` I fear nothing . 
`` Nothing , '' answered Varney , `` but looked on her with that aspect which governs madmen , women , and children . 
`` If so , '' replied Varney , `` she will but sleep the sounder , and the fear of that shall not break my rest . 
Varney was here since thou wert gone , and commanded me , with eyes in which I read my fate , to swallow yon horrible drug . 
`` He did not deem it harmless , I fear , '' replied the maiden ; `` but God confounds the devices of the wicked . 
`` If you deem me not so mean as may disgrace my husband , '' said the Countess , in the same resentful tone , `` you suppose my Lord of Leicester capable of abetting , perhaps of giving aim and authority to , the base proceedings of your father and Varney , whose errand I will do to the good Earl . '' 
`` Most men say of Varney , '' said Janet ; `` yet some call him only the convenient cloak of his master 's pleasures ; for reports of the profuse expense in garnishing yonder apartments have secretly gone abroad , and such doings far surpass the means of Varney . 
`` They do well to speak low , '' said the Countess , `` who would mention the illustrious Dudley as the accomplice of such a wretch as Varney . 
Wayland looked anxiously back at these horsemen , became considerably disturbed in his manner , looked back again , and became pale , as he said to the lady -- `` That is Richard Varney 's trotting gelding -- I would know him among a thousand nags -- this is a worse business than meeting the mercer . '' 
It is not that I fear either Varney or Lambourne in a good cause -- -LRB- your palfrey will go yet faster if you urge him -RRB- -- But yet -- -LRB- nay , I pray you let him not break off into the gallop , lest they should see we fear them , and give chase -- keep him only at the full trot -RRB- -- But yet , though I fear them not , I would we were well rid of them , and that rather by policy than by violence . 
Could we once reach the party before us , we may herd among them , and pass unobserved , unless Varney be really come in express pursuit of us , and then , happy man be his dole ! '' 
In this place they seemed to have made a pause , which gave Wayland the hope of joining them , and becoming a part of their company , ere Varney should overtake them . 
He was the more anxious , as his companion , though she made no complaints , and expressed no fear , began to look so deadly pale , that he was afraid she might drop from her horse . 
Notwithstanding this symptom of decaying strength , she pushed on her palfrey so briskly , that they joined the party in the bottom of the valley , ere Varney appeared on the top of the gentle eminence which they had descended . 
Wayland and his charge paused , as if out of curiosity , and then gradually , without making any enquiries , or being asked any questions , they mingled with the group , as if they had always made part of it . 
They had not stood there above five minutes , anxiously keeping as much to the side of the road as possible , so as to place the other travellers betwixt them and Varney , when Lord Leicester 's master of the horse , followed by Lambourne , came riding fiercely down the hill , their horses ' flanks and the rowels of their spurs showing bloody tokens of the rate at which they travelled . 
`` You are revellers , '' said Varney , `` designing for Kenilworth ? '' 
`` And why the devil stand you here , '' said Varney , `` when your utmost dispatch will but bring you to Kenilworth in time ? 
`` In very truth , sir , '' said a little diminutive urchin , wearing a vizard with a couple of sprouting horns of an elegant scarlet hue , having moreover a black serge jerkin drawn close to his body by lacing , garnished with red stockings , and shoes so shaped as to resemble cloven feet , -- `` In very truth , sir , and you are in the right o n't . 
answered Varney , whose laugh , however , never exceeded a sarcastic smile . 
said Varney . 
said Varney . 
`` Gaudet nomine Sibyllæ , '' said the first speaker , `` she is called Sibyl Laneham , wife of Master Richard Laneham '' -- `` Clerk to the Council-chamber door , '' said Varney ; `` why , she is inexcusable , having had experience how to have ordered her matters better . 
Wayland was about to hazard a reply to this alarming enquiry , when the little diablotin again thrust in his oar . 
`` So please you , '' he said , coming close up to Varney , and speaking so as not to be overheard by his companions , `` the man was our devil major , who has tricks enough to supply the lack of a hundred such as Dame Laneham ; and the woman -- if you please , is the sage person whose assistance is most particularly necessary to our distressed comrade . '' 
said Varney . 
`` I lack time just now , most hopeful imp of darkness , to witness his performance , '' said Varney ; `` but here is something for you all to drink the lucky hour -- and so , as the play says , ` God be with your labour ! 
`` And now , '' said the wily imp , sideling close up to Wayland 's horse , and cutting a gambol in the air , which seemed to vindicate his title to relationship with the prince of that element , `` I have told them who you are , do you in return tell me who I am ? '' 
But now , instead of following this natural course , she intrusted him with a letter to Leicester , the patron of Varney , and within whose jurisdiction at least , if not under his express authority , all the evils she had already suffered were inflicted upon her . 
Being disappointed in this expectation , and observing Varney amongst Leicester 's attendants , seeming as if he had some purpose of advancing to , and addressing him , he conceived , in the present circumstances , it was wisest to avoid the interview . 
He , therefore , left the presence-chamber when the High-Sheriff of the county was in the very midst of his dutiful address to her Majesty ; and , mounting his horse , rode back to Kenilworth , by a remote and circuitous road , and entered the castle by a small sallyport in the western wall , at which he was readily admitted as one of the followers of the Earl of Sussex , towards whom Leicester had commanded the utmost courtesy to be exercised . 
`` The villain , then , hath done you the poor justice which remained in his power , '' said Tressilian ; `` and I behold before me the wife of Varney ? '' 
`` The wife of Varney ! '' 
He expressed his resolution cautiously , however , doubting naturally whether Amy 's hopes of extricating herself from her difficulties rested on any thing stronger than a blinded attachment to Varney , whom he supposed to be her seducer . 
`` Amy , '' he said , while he fixed his sad and expressive eyes on hers , which , in her ecstasy of doubt , terror , and perplexity , she cast up towards him , `` I have ever remarked , that when others called thee girlish and wilful , there lay under that external semblance of youthful and self-willed folly , deep feeling and strong sense . 
Yet how could he have denied her request , -- dependent as she had too probably rendered herself upon Varney ? 
Such was his natural reasoning . 
The happiness of her future life might depend upon his not driving her to extremities , and since no authority of Tressilian 's could extricate her from the power of Varney , supposing he was to acknowledge Amy to be his wife , what title had he to destroy the hope of domestic peace which might yet remain to her , by setting enmity betwixt them ? 
`` I know nothing of that , '' said Wayland -- `` but I believe , if she is to reconcile herself with either Leicester or Varney , the side of the Castle of Kenilworth which will be safest for us will be the outside , from which we can fastest fly away . 
It is not my purpose to abide an instant after delivery of the letter to Leicester , which waits but your commands to find its way to him . 
-- Then there is the Doctor and Varney -- I will save myself from the whole mess of them -- Life is dearer than gold -- I will fly this instant , though I leave my reward behind me . '' 
My most reverend Signior of the Low Countries of Kenilworth , know that our most notable master , Richard Varney , would give as much to have a hole in this same Tressilian 's coat , as would make us some fifty midnight carousals , with the full leave of bidding the steward go snick up , if he came to startle us too soon from our goblets . '' 
While Staples remonstrated , Lambourne drank ; and then setting down the pitcher , which was nearly emptied , with a deep sigh , he said , in an under tone , which soon rose to a high one as his speech proceeded , `` Never mind , Lawrence -- if I be drunk , I know that shall make Varney uphold me sober . 
Let us see the best roarer that ever strained his lungs for twelve pence out-mouth me ! 
`` O , ay , '' said Blount ; `` Varney , and a whole tribe of Leicestrians , besides about a score of us honest Sussex folk . 
Varney followed close behind his master , as the principal esquire in waiting , and had charge of his lordship 's black velvet bonnet , garnished with a clasp of diamonds , and surmounted by a white plume . 
He kept his eye constantly on his master ; and , for reasons with which the reader is not unacquainted , was , among Leicester 's numerous dependants , the one who was most anxious that his lord 's strength and resolution should carry him successfully through a day so agitating . 
For although Varney was one of the few -- the very few moral monsters , who contrive to lull to sleep the remorse of their own bosoms , and are drugged into moral insensibility by atheism , as men in extreme agony are lulled by opium , yet he knew that in the breast of his patron there was already awakened the fire that is never quenched , and that his lord felt , amid all the pomp and magnificence we have described , the gnawing of the worm that dieth not . 
Still , however , assured as Lord Leicester stood , by Varney 's own intelligence , that his Countess laboured under an indisposition which formed an unanswerable apology to the Queen for her not appearing at Kenilworth , there was little danger , his wily retainer thought , that a man so ambitious would betray himself by giving way to any external weakness . 
The Earl then prayed her Majesty for permission , that he himself , and the nobles who had been in attendance upon her during the journey , might retire for a few minutes , and put themselves into a guise more fitting for dutiful attendance , during which space , those genetlemen of worship , -LRB- pointing to Varney , Blount , Tressilian , and others , -RRB- who had already put themselves into fresh attire , would have the honour of keeping her presence-chamber . 
With still greater reluctance Raleigh named and pointed out to her Varney , for whom the tailor had done all that art could perform in making his exterior agreeable ; and who , if he had not grace , had a sort of tact and habitual knowledge of breeding , which came in place of it . 
I remember that Varney is a smooth-tongued varlet . 
An involuntary shudder came over Leicester , as he bowed low , expressive of his readiness to receive her royal commands ; and a similar cold fit came over Varney , whose eyes -LRB- seldom during that evening removed from his patron -RRB- instantly perceived , from the change in his looks , slight as that was , of what the Queen was speaking . 
But Leicester had wrought his resolution up to the point which , in his crooked policy , he judged necessary ; and when Elizabeth added -- `` It is of the matter of Varney and Tressilian we speak -- is the lady in presence , my lord ? '' 
But -- Varney , step forward -- this gentleman will inform your Grace of the cause why the lady '' -LRB- he could not force his rebellious tongue to utter the words -- his wife -RRB- `` can not attend on your royal presence . '' 
Varney advanced , and pleaded with readiness , what indeed he firmly believed , the absolute incapacity of the party -LRB- for neither did he dare , in Leicester 's presence , term her his wife -RRB- to wait on her Grace . 
`` Here , '' said he , `` are attestations from a most learned physician , whose skill and honour are well known to my good Lord of Leicester ; and from an honest and devout Protestant , a man of credit and substance , one Anthony Foster , the gentleman in whose house she is at present bestowed , that she now labours under an illness which altogether unfits her for such a journey as betwixt this Castle and the neighbourhood of Oxford . '' 
-- Master Tressilian , we have much sympathy for your situation , the rather that you seem to have set your heart deeply on this Amy Robsart , or Varney . 
But since thou lists to be so formal -- Varney , or rather my Lord of Leicester , for the affair becomes yours , '' -LRB- these words , though spoken at random , thrilled through the Earl 's marrow and bones , -RRB- `` what evidence have you as touching these certificates ? '' 
Varney hastened to reply , preventing Leicester , -- `` So please your Majesty , my young Lord of Oxford , who is here in presence , knows Master Anthony Foster 's hand and his character . '' 
Yet this public display of his imperfection of brain plainly shows us that his supposed injury and accusation were fruitless ; and therefore , my Lord of Leicester , we remember your suit formerly made to us in behalf of your faithful servant Varney , whose good gifts and fidelity , as they are useful to you , ought to have due reward from us , knowing well that your lordship , and all you have , are so earnestly devoted to our service . 
And we render Varney the honour more especially , that we are a guest , and we fear a chargeable and troublesome one , under your lordship 's roof ; and also for the satisfaction of the good old Knight of Devon , Sir Hugh Robsart , whose daughter he hath married ; and we trust the especial mark of grace which we are about to confer , may reconcile him to his son-in-law . 
-- Richard Varney , come forth , and kneel down . 
-- Arise , Sir Richard Varney . '' 
Varney arose and retired , making a deep obeisance to the Sovereign who had done him so much honour . 
`` The buckling of the spur , and what other rites remain , '' said the Queen , `` may be finished to-morrow in the chapel ; for we intend Sir Richard Varney a companion in his honours . 
`` Sir Richard Varney , surely -- the friend of my Lord of Leicester -- surely he has merit , '' replied the Duchess . 
`` Varney has a sly countenance , and a smooth tongue , '' replied the Queen . 
`` I fear me , he will prove a knave -- but the promise was of ancient standing . 
Varney gave his largesse with an affectation of complaisance and humility . 
These donations were accepted with the usual clamour and vivats of applause common on such occasions ; but as the parties gratified were chiefly dependants of Lord Leicester , it was Varney whose name was repeated with the loudest acclamations . 
Lambourne , especially , distinguished himself by his vociferations of `` Long life to Sir Richard Varney ! 
-- Health and honour to Sir Richard ! 
Varney , who had changed his splendid attire , and now waited on his patron in a very modest and plain undress , attended to do the honours of the Earl 's coucher . 
Sir Richard , '' said Leicester , smiling , `` your new rank scarce suits the humility of this attendance . '' 
`` I would disown that rank , my lord , '' said Varney , `` could I think it was to remove me to a distance from your lordship 's person . '' 
While thus speaking , he still accepted , without hesitation , the offices about his person , which the new-made knight seemed to render as eagerly as if he had really felt , in discharging the task , that pleasure which his words expressed . 
`` I am not afraid of men 's misconstruction , '' he said , in answer to Leicester 's remark , `` since there is not -- -LRB- permit me to undo the collar -RRB- -- a man within the Castle , who does not expect very soon to see persons of a rank far superior to that which , by your goodness , I now hold , rendering the duties of the bedchamber to you , and accounting it an honour . '' 
`` It might , indeed , so have been '' -- said the Earl , with an involuntary sigh ; and then presently added , `` My gown , Varney -- I will look out on the night . 
`` I think so , my lord , according to the calendar , '' answered Varney . 
Leicester looked out on the blue arch of heaven , with gestures and a countenance expressive of anxious exultation , while Varney , who remained within the darkened apartment , could , -LRB- himself unnoticed , -RRB- with a secret satisfaction , see his patron stretch his hands with earnest gesticulation towards the heavenly bodies . 
He looked on the heavens in profound silence for a minute or two longer , and then again stepped into the apartment , where Varney seemed to have been engaged in putting the Earl 's jewels into a casket . 
`` Many learned and great men have thought otherwise , '' said Varney ; `` and , not to flatter your lordship , my own opinion leans that way . '' 
`` Perhaps , my lord , '' said Varney , `` I may be misled on the present occasion , by my wish to find the predictions of astrology true . 
`` It is even so , '' said Leicester , looking at an abstract of astrological calculations which he had in his hand ; `` the stronger influence will prevail , and , as I think , the evil hour pass away . 
-- Lend me your hand , Sir Richard , to doff my gown -- and remain an instant , if it is not too burdensome to your knighthood , while I compose myself to sleep . 
Varney officiously assisted his lord to bed , and placed a massive silver night-lamp , with a short sword , on a marble table which stood close by the head of the couch . 
Either in order to avoid the light of the lamp , or to hide his countenance from Varney , Leicester drew the curtain , heavy with entwined silk and gold , so as completely to shade his face . 
Varney took a seat near the bed , but with his back towards his master , as if to intimate that he was not watching him , and quietly waited till Leicester himself led the way to the topic by which his mind was engrossed . 
`` And so , Varney , '' said the Earl , after waiting in vain till his dependant should commence the conversation , `` men talk of the Queen 's favour towards me ? '' 
`` Ay , my good lord , '' said Varney ; `` of what can they else , since it is so strongly manifested ? '' 
''' `` A good sentence and a true , '' said Varney , `` unless you can unite their interest with yours so absolutely , that they must needs sit on your wrist like hooded hawks . '' 
`` It is your speech , my lord , not mine , '' answered Varney ; `` but whose soever be the speech , it is the thought of ninety-nine out of an hundred men throughout broad England . '' 
`` Ay , but , '' said Leicester , turning himself in his bed , `` the hundredth man knows better . 
`` It must , my lord , if the stars speak true , '' said Varney , composedly . 
`` You mistake , my lord , under your gracious pardon , '' said Varney ; `` I believe in many things that predict the future . 
`` Thou art right , '' said Leicester , again tossing himself on his couch -- `` Earth does wish for it . 
`` I know not that , my lord , '' said Varney , `` the Countess is indisposed . '' 
said Leicester , starting up on his couch , and seizing the sword which lay on the table beside him , `` go thy thoughts that way ? 
said Varney , assuming the superiority of an innocent man subjected to unjust suspicion . 
`` Good night , my lord , '' said Varney , seeming to understand this as a command to depart ; but Leicester 's voice interrupted his purpose . 
`` Thou ` scapest me not thus , Sir Fool , '' said he ; `` I think thy knighthood has addled thy brains -- Confess thou hast talked of impossibilities , as of things which may come to pass . '' 
`` My lord , long live your fair Countess , '' said Varney ; `` but neither your love nor my good wishes can make her immortal . 
`` Nay , now , Varney , thou art stark-mad , '' said Leicester . 
`` I would I were myself within the same nearness to a good estate of freehold , '' said Varney . 
`` Ay , and the most learned doctors in foreign universities justify the practice from the Old Testament , '' said Varney . 
-- Good night , Sir Richard Varney -- yet stay -- Can you guess what meant Tressilian by showing himself in such careless guise before the Queen to-day ? 
Varney , smothering a sneering laugh , answered , `` He believed Master Tressilian had no such matter in his head . '' 
There is ever knavery in that laugh of thine , Varney . '' 
`` I only meant , my lord , '' said Varney , `` that Tressilian has taken the sure way to avoid heart-breaking . 
Keep eye on him , however , Varney . '' 
`` I lodged him for that reason , '' said Varney , `` in Mervyn 's Tower , where he is under the eye of my very vigilant , if he were not also my very drunken , servant , Michael Lambourne , whom I have told your Grace of . '' 
`` May your lordship soon have cause to say so from experience , '' said Varney ; and , wishing his patron good night , he withdrew . 
As Lambourne , on entering , dropped the lap of his cloak from his face , she knew Varney 's profligate servant ; the very last person , excepting his detested master , by whom she would have wished to be discovered . 
`` Nay , go not to it again , '' said the sewer , `` or I will call for him shall tame you both , and that is Master Varney -- Sir Richard , I mean -- he is stirring , I promise you -- I saw him cross the court just now . '' 
`` What hast thou done to him ? '' 
said the sewer , speaking aside to the jailor ; `` his face is fearfully swelled . '' 
`` It is but the imprint of the key of my cabinet -- too good a mark for his gallows-face . 
Reasoning thus like a woman , to whom external appearance is scarcely in any circumstances a matter of unimportance , and like a beauty , who had some confidence in the power of her own charms , she laid aside her travelling cloak and capotaine hat , and placed them beside her , so that she could assume them in an instant , ere one could penetrate from the entrance of the grotto to its extremity , in case the intrusion of Varney or of Lambourne should render such disguise necessary . 
`` I request -- I implore , '' stammered forth the unfortunate Countess , -- `` I beseech your gracious protection -- against -- against one Varney . '' 
`` What , Varney -- Sir Richard Varney -- the servant of Lord Leicester ? 
Well , I see I must wring the story from thee by inches -- Thou didst deceive thine old and honoured father -- thy look confesses it -- cheated Master Tressilian -- thy blush avouches it -- and married this same Varney ? '' 
I am not the wife of Varney ! 
He had already raised his head , with the dignity of a man of honour , to avow his marriage , and proclaim himself the protector of his Countess , when Varney , born , as it appeared , to be his master 's evil genius , rushed into the presence , with every mark of disorder on his face and apparel . 
Varney , with the air of a man altogether overwhelmed with grief and confusion , prostrated himself before her feet , exclaiming , `` Pardon , my Liege , pardon ! 
She turned her face angrily from him , and said to Varney , `` Speak , Sir Richard , and explain these riddles -- thou hast sense and the use of speech , at least , which elsewhere we look for in vain . '' 
As she said this , she darted another resentful glance towards Leicester , while the wily Varney hastened to tell his own story . 
`` Your Majesty 's piercing eye , '' he said , `` has already detected the cruel malady of my beloved lady ; which , unhappy that I am , I would not suffer to be expressed in the certificate of her physician , seeking to conceal what has now broken out with so much the more scandal . '' 
`` My gracious Liege , '' said Varney , `` the worthy gentleman under whose charge I left her , Master Anthony Foster , has come hither but now , as fast as man and horse can travel , to show me of her escape , which she managed with the art peculiar to many who are afflicted with this malady . 
`` But , Sir Richard , we envy you not your domestic felicity ; your lady railed on you bitterly , and seemed ready to swoon at beholding you . '' 
`` It is the nature of persons in her disorder , so please your Grace , '' answered Varney , `` to be ever most inveterate in their spleen against those , whom , in their better moments , they hold nearest and dearest . '' 
`` May your Grace then be pleased , '' said Varney , `` to command my unfortunate wife to be delivered into the custody of her friends ? '' 
Leicester partly started ; but , making a strong effort , he subdued his emotion , while Elizabeth answered sharply , `` You are something too hasty , Master Varney ; we will have first a report of the lady 's health and state of mind from Masters , our own physician , and then determine what shall be thought just . 
Varney bowed low , and made no other answer . 
It was not till after a long and successful morning 's sport , and a prolonged repast which followed the return of the Queen to the Castle , that Leicester at length found himself alone with Varney , from whom he now learned the whole particulars of the Countess 's escape , as they had been brought to Kenilworth by Foster , who , in his terror for the consequences , had himself posted thither with the tidings . 
As Varney , in his narrative , took especial care to be silent concerning those practices on the Countess 's health which had driven her to so desperate a resolution , Leicester , who could only suppose that she had adopted it out of jealous impatience , to attain the avowed state and appearance belonging to her rank , was not a little offended at the levity with which his wife had broken his strict commands , and exposed him to the resentment of Elizabeth . 
`` I have given , '' he said , `` to this daughter of an obscure Devonshire gentleman , the proudest name in England . 
`` We may post it over yet well enough , '' said Varney , `` if my lady will be but ruled , and take on her the character which the time commands . '' 
`` It is but too true , Sir Richard , '' said Leicester , `` there is indeed no other remedy . 
`` And long afterwards , I trust , '' said Varney ; then instantly added , `` For I can not but hope it will be long after ere she bear the title of Lady Leicester -- I fear me it may scarce be with safety during the life of this Queen . 
`` You are right , Varney , '' said Leicester ; `` I have this morning been both fool and villain ; and when Elizabeth hears of my unhappy marriage , she can not but think herself treated with that premeditated slight which women never forgive . 
said Varney . 
`` Ay , '' answered Varney ; `` the Italians say right -- in lovers ' quarrels , the party that loves most is always most willing to acknowledge the greater fault . 
Leicester sighed , and was silent for a moment , ere he replied . 
`` Varney , I think thou art true to me , and I will tell thee all . 
`` We must do something , my lord , '' said Varney , `` and that speedily . '' 
`` Think better of your situation , my lord , '' said Varney -- `` let us try the experiment in which you have but now acquiesced . 
`` No , Varney , '' said Leicester ; `` I have thought upon what is to be done , and I will myself speak with Amy . '' 
It was now Varney 's turn to feel , upon his own account , the terrors which he affected to participate solely on account of his patron . 
Varney had no alternative save obedience . 
In a few minutes Leicester was muffled in the mantle , pulled his bonnet over his brows , and followed Varney along the secret passage of the Castle which communicated with Hunsdon 's apartments , in which there was scarce a chance of meeting any inquisitive person , and hardly light enough for any such to have satisfied their curiosity . 
They emerged at a door where Lord Hunsdon had , with military precaution , placed a sentinel , one of his own northern retainers as it fortuned , who readily admitted Sir Richard Varney and his attendant , saying only , in his northern dialect , `` I would , man , thou couldst make the mad lady be still yonder ; for her moans do sae dirl through my head , that I would rather keep watch on a snow-drift , in the wastes of Catlowdie . '' 
`` Now , good devil , if there be one , '' said Varney , within himself , `` for once help a votary at a dead pinch , for my boat is amongst the breakers ! '' 
She turned hastily round , and , fixing her eye on Varney , exclaimed , `` Wretch ! 
Leicester cut short her reproaches by stepping forward , and dropping his cloak , while he said , in a voice rather of authority than of affection , `` It is with me , madam , you have to commune , not with Sir Richard Varney . '' 
And with the speed of lightning she flew to her husband , clung around his neck , and , unheeding the presence of Varney , overwhelmed him with caresses , while she bathed his face in a flood of tears ; muttering , at the same time , but in broken and disjointed monosyllables , the fondest expressions which Love teaches his votaries . 
-- but I will say nothing of myself -- only that if it might be otherwise , I would not willingly return thither ; -- yet if it concern your safety '' -- `` We will think , Amy , of some other retreat , '' said Leicester ; `` and you shall go to one of my Northern Castles , under the personage -- it will be but needful , I trust , for a very few days -- of Varney 's wife . '' 
said the lady , disengaging herself from his embraces ; `` is it to your wife you give the dishonourable counsel to acknowledge herself the bride of another -- and of all men , the bride of that Varney ? '' 
`` Madam , I speak it in earnest -- Varney is my true and faithful servant , trusted in my deepest secrets . 
I had better lose my right hand than his service at this moment . 
You have no cause to scorn him as you do . '' 
How could you again , my lord , acknowledge me as a pure and chaste matron , worthy to share your fortunes , when , holding that high character , I had strolled the country the acknowledged wife of such a profligate fellow as your servant Varney ? '' 
`` My lord , '' said Varney interposing , `` my lady is too much prejudiced against me , unhappily , to listen to what I can offer ; yet it may please her better than what she proposes . 
Varney proceeded with a tone of deliberation . 
`` Doubtless this will make it necessary to take strangers into my lord 's counsels ; but surely the Countess will be warrant for the honour of Master Tressilian , and such of her father 's family '' -- `` Peace , Varney , '' said Leicester ; `` by Heaven I will strike my dagger into thee , if again thou namest Tressilian as a partner of my counsels ! '' 
said the Countess ; `` unless they be counsels fitter for such as Varney , than for a man of stainless honour and integrity . 
I can forbear , '' she said , looking at Varney , `` to pull the mask off hypocrisy , but I will not permit virtue to be slandered in my hearing . '' 
Leicester stood displeased , yet undetermined , and too conscious of the weakness of his cause ; while Varney , with a deep and hypocritical affectation of sorrow , mingled with humility , bent his eyes on the ground . 
-- Varney , we must hence . 
He embraced her fervently , muffled himself as before , and accompanied Varney from the apartment . 
The latter , as he left the room , bowed low , and , as he raised his body , regarded Amy with a peculiar expression , as if he desired to know how far his own pardon was included in the reconciliation which had taken place betwixt her and her lord . 
Varney was one of those politicians , whom not the slightest appearances escape without enquiry . 
He asked the sentinel what the lad wanted with him , and received for answer , that the boy had wished him to transmit a parcel to the mad lady , but that he cared not to take charge of it , such communication being beyond his commission . 
Leicester and Varney returned with hasty steps to the Earl 's private apartment , by the same passage which had conducted them to Saintlowe 's Tower . 
They were no sooner in the Earl 's cabinet , than , taking his tablets from his pocket , he began to write , speaking partly to Varney , and partly to himself : -- `` There are many of them close bounden to me , and especially those in good estate and high office ; many who , if they look back towards my benefits , or forward towards the perils which may befall themselves , will not , I think , be disposed to see me stagger unsupported . 
-- Why look you so sad , Varney ? 
my lord , '' said Varney , with well-acted passion , and then resumed the same look of despondency which Leicester had before noted . 
repeated Leicester , `` and wherefore alas , Sir Richard ? 
`` Not so , my lord , '' answered his confident ; `` Varney will be found fighting or dying by your side . 
He paused , and Leicester threw his tablets from him with an air of reckless despite . 
`` It may be as thou say ` st , '' he said ; `` and , in sooth , I care not whether truth or cowardice dictate thy forebodings . 
`` Let me remind you , my lord , '' said Varney , with the same appearance of deep and melancholy interest , `` that you have given me orders to prepare for disarming the Queen 's guard . 
Here there was another pause , which Varney at length broke with the following words : `` It is come to the point I have long dreaded . 
`` Pardon me , my lord , '' said Varney ; `` the use lies here . 
said Leicester , with eyes sternly fixed on his dependant ; `` of whom dost thou dare to speak ? '' 
`` Thou meanest well , good Sir Richard , and wouldst , I think , sacrifice thine own honour , as well as that of any other person , to save me from what thou think ` st a step so terrible . 
`` I do , my lord , '' said Varney ; `` but it is for the welfare of the Earl of Leicester . 
`` Thou speak ` st wild madness , Varney , with the sober face of a preacher . 
`` My lord , '' said Varney , `` unfortunately I can show that but too well . 
At length he answered , `` What other evidence hast thou of this , Varney , save thine own assertion ? 
He repeated these words more than once to himself , as if in the very sound there was a sedative quality ; and again compressing his lips , as if he feared some violent expression might escape from them , he asked again , `` What farther proof ? '' 
`` Enough , my lord , '' said Varney , `` and to spare . 
He then acquainted Lord Leicester how easy it was to prove the circumstance of their interview true , by evidence of Anthony Foster , with the corroborative testimonies of the various persons at Cumnor , who had heard the wager laid , and had seen Lambourne and Tressilian set off together . 
In the whole narrative , Varney hazarded nothing fabulous , excepting that , not indeed by direct assertion , but by inference , he led his patron to suppose that the interview betwixt Amy and Tressilian at Cumnor-Place had been longer than the few minutes to which it was in reality limited . 
`` Why did all of ye -- and in particular thou , Varney -- keep back from me such material information ? '' 
`` Because , my lord , '' replied Varney , `` the Countess pretended to Foster and to me , that Tressilian had intruded himself upon her ; and I concluded their interview had been in all honour , and that she would at her own time tell it to your lordship . 
`` You are but too ready to receive them , however , Sir Richard , '' replied his patron . 
`` Questionless , my lord , '' answered Varney ; `` had I thought otherwise , I had been no keeper of the secret . 
`` Since it must be so , '' answered Varney , `` the lady resorted immediately to the apartment of Tressilian , where she remained many hours , partly in company with him , and partly alone . 
he exclaimed , hastily . 
You may remember , '' answered Varney , `` that he was that night placed with Sir Nicholas Blount , under a species of arrest . '' 
`` No , my lord , '' replied Varney ; `` Carrol and the Warder had never seen the Countess , and Lambourne knew her not in her disguise ; but , in seeking to prevent her leaving the cell , he obtained possession of one of her gloves , which , I think , your lordship may know . '' 
He gave the glove , which had the Bear and Ragged Staff , the Earl 's impress , embroidered upon it in seed-pearls . 
`` Your lordship , '' said Varney , `` might yet further enquire of the lady herself , respecting the truth of these passages . '' 
`` My lord , '' said Varney , `` a tear from my lady would have blotted out all I could have said . 
-- And yet , Varney , so young , so fair , so fawning , and so false ! 
`` I never gave her any other cause of dislike , my lord , '' replied Varney ; `` but she knew that my counsels went directly to diminish her influence with your lordship ; and that I was , and have been , ever ready to peril my life against your enemies . '' 
Can it be so , Varney ? 
-- Varney , thou hast been my servant from a child -- I have raised thee high -- can raise thee higher . 
The agony with which his master spoke had some effect even on the hardened Varney , who , in the midst of his own wicked and ambitious designs , really loved his patron as well as such a wretch was capable of loving any thing ; but he comforted himself , and subdued his self-reproaches , with the reflection , that if he inflicted upon the Earl some immediate and transitory pain , it was in order to pave his way to the throne , which , were this marriage dissolved by death or otherwise , he deemed Elizabeth would willingly share with his benefactor . 
exclaimed Leicester , his transient gleam of hope giving way to the utmost bitterness of feeling and expression ; `` thou art not fit to fathom a woman 's depth of wit , Varney . 
-- Speak not for her , Varney ! 
`` My lord , '' replied Varney , `` the wildness of your distress breaks forth in the wildness of your language . '' 
And -- what is this casket , '' he said , `` which was even now thrust into my hand by a boy , with the desire I would convey it to Tressilian , as he could not give it to the Countess ? 
-- Force it open , Varney ; force the hinges open with thy poniard . '' 
`` She refused the aid of my dagger once , '' thought Varney , as he unsheathed the weapon , `` to cut the string which bound a letter , but now it shall work a mightier ministry in her fortunes . '' 
With this reflection , by using the three-cornered stiletto-blade as a wedge , he forced open the slender silver hinges of the casket . 
The Earl no sooner saw them give way , than he snatched the casket from Sir Richard 's hand , wrenched off the cover , and tearing out the splendid contents , flung them on the floor in a transport of rage , while he eagerly searched for some letter or billet , which should make the fancied guilt of his innocent Countess yet more apparent . 
-- Tell me not of forgiveness , Varney -- She is doomed ! '' 
Varney looked after him , while something of a more human feeling seemed to contend with his habitual sneer . 
`` I am sorry for his weakness , '' he said , `` but love has made him a child . 
He throws down and treads on these costly toys -- with the same vehemence would he dash to pieces this frailest toy of all , of which he used to rave so fondly . 
Well , he has no eye to value things as they deserve , and that nature has given to Varney . 
When Leicester shall be a sovereign , he will think as little of the gales of passion , through which he gained that royal port , as ever did sailor in harbour , of the perils of a voyage . 
While Varney was employed in gathering together and putting them into a secret drawer of a cabinet that chanced to be unlocked , he saw the door of Leicester 's closet open , the tapestry pushed aside , and the Earl 's face thrust out , but with eyes so dead , and lips and cheeks so bloodless and pale , that he started at the sudden change . 
This manoeuvre Leicester repeated twice , without speaking a word , so that Varney began to doubt whether his brain was not actually affected by his mental agony . 
The third time , however , he beckoned , and Varney obeyed the signal . 
When he entered , he soon found his patron 's perturbation was not caused by insanity , but by the fellness of purpose which he entertained , contending with various contrary passions . 
It was afterwards remembered , that during the banquets and revels which occupied the remainder of this eventful day , the bearing of Leicester and of Varney were totally different from their usual demeanour . 
Sir Richard Varney had been held rather a man of counsel and of action , than a votary of pleasure . 
Business , whether civil or military , seemed always to be his proper sphere ; and while in festivals and revels , although he well understood how to trick them up and present them , his own part was that of a mere spectator ; or , if he exercised his wit , it was in a rough , caustic , and severe manner , rather as if he scoffed at the exhibition and the guests , than shared the common pleasure . 
But upon the present day his character seemed changed . 
He mixed among the younger courtiers and ladies , and appeared for the moment to be actuated by a spirit of light-hearted gaiety , which rendered him a match for the liveliest . 
Those who had looked upon him as a man given up to graver and more ambitious pursuits , a bitter sneerer and passer of sarcasms at the expense of those , who , taking life as they find it , were disposed to snatch at each pastime it presents , now perceived with astonishment that his wit could carry as smooth an edge as their own , his laugh be as lively , and his brow as unclouded . 
It was clear , however , that this could not last much longer , and that Elizabeth must finally put another and more severe construction on Leicester 's uncourteous conduct , when the Earl was summoned by Varney to speak with him in a different apartment . 
At the door of the apartment he was met by Varney , who eagerly drew him apart , and whispered in his ear , `` All is well ! '' 
`` He will not know of her departure for some time , '' replied Varney ; `` it shall take place this very evening , and to-morrow he shall be cared for . '' 
`` Not so , by Heaven , Varney ! '' 
Varney saw with great alarm that his lord was wrought up to such a pitch of agitation , that if he gave not way to him , he was perfectly capable of adopting the desperate resolution which he had announced , and which was instant ruin to all the schemes of ambition which Varney had formed for his patron and for himself . 
said Leicester , struck at the change in his own physiognomy , though offended at the freedom with which Varney made the appeal . 
`` No , my lord , '' said Varney , firmly , `` but be master of yourself , and of your own passion . 
-- Go , my lord -- but first take farewell of Richard Varney , with all the benefits you ever conferred on him . 
He served the noble , the lofty , the high-minded Leicester , and was more proud of depending on him , than he would be of commanding thousands . 
But the abject lord who stoops to every adverse circumstance , whose judicious resolves are scattered like chaff before every wind of passion , him Richard Varney serves not . 
He is as much above him in constancy of mind , as beneath him in rank and fortune . '' 
Varney spoke thus without hypocrisy , for , though the firmness of mind which he boasted was hardness and impenetrability , yet he really felt the ascendency which he vaunted ; while the interest which he actually felt in the fortunes of Leicester , gave unusual emotion to his voice and manner . 
Leicester was overpowered by his assumed superiority ; it seemed to the unfortunate Earl as if his last friend was about to abandon him . 
He stretched his hand towards Varney , as he uttered the words , `` Do not leave me -- What wouldst thou have me do ? '' 
`` Be thyself , my noble master , '' said Varney , touching the Earl 's hand with his lips , after having respectfully grasped it in his own ; `` be yourself , superior to those storms of passion which wreck inferior minds . 
While he was speaking , the Earl held his hand fast , compressed his lips hard , and frowned , as if he laboured to catch from Varney a portion of the cold , ruthless , and dispassionate firmness which he recommended . 
When he was silent , the Earl still continued to grasp his hand , until , with an effort at calm decision , he was able to articulate , `` Be it so -- she dies ! 
`` Not one , my lord , '' interrupted Varney , who saw by the quivering eye and convulsed cheek of his patron , that he was about to give way to a burst of emotion , -- `` Not a tear -- the time permits it not -- Tressilian must be thought of '' -- `` That indeed is a name , '' said the Earl , `` to convert tears into blood . 
Varney , I have thought on this , and I have determined -- neither entreaty nor argument shall move me -- Tressilian shall be my own victim . '' 
`` Then , my lord , '' said Varney , `` I first request of you to lay aside the wild , suspected , and half-frenzied demeanour , which hath this day drawn the eyes of all the court upon you ; and which , but for the Queen 's partial indulgence , which she hath extended towards you in a degree far beyond her nature , she had never given you the opportunity to atone for . '' 
`` I must crave your signet-ring , '' said Varney , gravely , `` in token to those of your servants whom I must employ , that I possess your full authority in commanding their aid . '' 
Leicester drew off the signet-ring , which he commonly used , and gave it to Varney with a haggard and stern expression of countenance , adding only , in a low , half-whispered tone , but with terrific emphasis , the words , `` What thou dost , do quickly . '' 
Amply did Leicester that day redeem the pledge he had given to Varney , who soon saw himself no longer under the necessity of maintaining a character so different from his own , as that which he had assumed in the earlier part of the day , and gradually relapsed into the same grave , shrewd , caustic observer of conversation and incident , which constituted his usual part in society . 
He was too wary to exchange on a sudden the sullen personage which he had played before he retired with Varney ; but , on approaching her , it seemed softened into a melancholy , which had a touch of tenderness in it , and which , in the course of conversing with Elizabeth , and as she dropped in compassion one mark of favour after another to console him , passed into a flow of affectionate gallantry , the most assiduous , the most delicate , the most insinuating , yet at the same time the most respectful , with which a Queen was ever addressed by a subject . 
Let Varney care for her with fitting humanity ; but let them rid the Castle of her forthwith . 
Here has Sir Richard Varney asked our permission to depart from the Castle with his infirm lady , having , as he tells us , your lordship 's consent to his absence , so he can obtain ours . 
Certes , we have no will to withhold him from the affectionate charge of this poor young person -- but you are to know , that Sir Richard Varney hath this day shown himself so much captivated with these ladies of ours , that here is our Duchess of Rutland says , he will carry his poor insane wife no farther than the lake , plunge her in , to tenant the crystal palaces that the enchanted nymph told us of , and return a jolly widower , to dry his tears , and to make up the loss among our train . 
-- We have seen Varney under two or three different guises -- you know what are his proper attributes -- think you he is capable of playing his lady such a knave 's trick ? '' 
`` Hear him , my ladies , '' said Elizabeth ; `` like all his sex , he would excuse their cruelty by imputing fickleness to us . '' 
His direction to the valet who attended him , was to send Varney instantly to his apartment . 
The messenger returned after some delay , and informed him that an hour had elapsed since Sir Richard Varney had left the Castle , by the postern-gate , with three other persons , one of whom was transported in a horse-litter . 
`` How came he to leave the Castle after the watch was set ? '' 
said Leicester ; `` I thought he went not till daybreak . '' 
`` He gave satisfactory reasons , as I understand , '' said the domestic , `` to the guard , and , as I hear , showed your lordship 's signet '' -- `` True -- true , '' said the Earl ; `` yet he has been hasty -- Do any of his attendants remain behind ? '' 
`` Michael Lambourne , my lord , '' said the valet , `` was not to be found when Sir Richard Varney departed , and his master was much incensed at his absence . 
I saw him but now saddling his horse to gallop after his master . '' 
`` Bid him come hither instantly , '' said Leicester ; `` I have a message to his master . '' 
The servant left the apartment , and Leicester traversed it for some time in deep meditation -- `` Varney is over zealous , '' he said , `` over pressing -- He loves me , I think -- but he hath his own ends to serve , and he is inexorable in pursuit of them . 
If I rise he rises , and he hath shown himself already but too eager to rid me of this obstacle which seems to stand betwixt me and sovereignty . 
She shall be punished , but it shall be more advisedly . 
He seized upon writing materials , and hastily traced these words : -- `` Sir Richard Varney , we have resolved to defer the matter intrusted to your care , and strictly command you to proceed no farther in relation to our Countess , until our further order . 
`` Tie up thy saucy tongue , sir , '' said Leicester ; `` the jests that may suit Sir Richard Varney 's presence , suit not mine . 
Deliver this letter speedily and carefully into Sir Richard Varney 's hands . '' 
Lambourne mounted , accordingly , and left the Castle by the postern-gate , where his free passage was permitted , in consequence of a message to that effect left by Sir Richard Varney . 
I promise you , it required both your warrant and the Queen 's , to keep me from entering into the game , and cutting that Varney of yours over the head ; and now there is a brawl down in the Pleasance , or what call you the stone terrace-walk , where all yonder gimcracks stand ? '' 
The letter concluded with the most earnest expressions of devoted attachment , and submission to his will in all things , and particularly respecting her situation and place of residence , conjuring him only that she might not be placed under the guardianship or restraint of Varney . 
exclaimed Leicester ; `` but O , that worst of villains , Varney ! 
-- and she is even now in his power ! '' 
My own quarrel with you is ended , my lord ; but there is another to begin with the seducer of Amy Robsart , who has screened his guilt under the cloak of the infamous Varney . '' 
The caution , and indeed the alarm , which Wayland had expressed respecting Varney and Lambourne , led him to judge , that the letter must be designed for the Earl 's own hand , and that he might prejudice the lady , by giving it to any of the domestics . 
The boy confessed to Wayland what we have above told , and the artist , in return , informed him , that his deep anxiety for the fate of the unfortunate lady had brought him back to the neighbourhood of the Castle , upon his learning that morning at a village about ten miles distant , that Varney and Lambourne , whose violence he dreaded , had both left Kenilworth over-night . 
Leicester 's confession , for such it might be called , was wrenched from him piecemeal , yet was upon the whole accurate , excepting that he totally omitted to mention that he had , by implication , or otherwise , assented to Varney 's designs upon the life of his Countess . 
Yet the consciousness of this was what at that moment lay nearest to his heart ; and although he trusted in great measure to the very positive counter-orders which he had sent by Lambourne , it was his purpose to set out for Cumnor-Place , in person , as soon as he should be dismissed from the presence of the Queen , who , he concluded , would presently leave Kenilworth . 
I see you are dying of curiosity to know the happy bride -- It is Amy Robsart , the same who , to make up the May-game yesterday , figured in the pageant as the wife of his servant Varney . '' 
You will furnish them , Master Secretary , with the warrant necessary to secure the bodies of Richard Varney and the foreign Alasco , dead or alive . 
They endeavoured to procure some tidings as they rode along of Varney and his party , but could hear none , as they had travelled in the dark . 
Tressilian did so , and after some inarticulate murmurs , in which the names of Varney and Lady Leicester were alone distinguishable , Lambourne bade him `` make haste , or he would come too late . '' 
We are now to return to that part of our story where we intimated that Varney , possessed of the authority of the Earl of Leicester , and of the Queen 's permission to the same effect , hastened to secure himself against discovery of his perfidy , by removing the Countess from Kenilworth Castle . 
As his return was expected , Sir Richard commanded that he should prepare himself for attending him on an immediate journey , and follow him in case he returned after his departure . 
In the meanwhile , Varney used the ministry of a servant called Robin Tider , one to whom the mysteries of Cumnor-Place were already in some degree known , as he had been there more than once in attendance on the Earl . 
To this man , whose character resembled that of Lambourne , though he was neither quite so prompt nor altogether so profligate , Varney gave command to have three horses saddled , and to prepare a horse-litter , and have them in readiness at the postern-gate . 
The natural enough excuse of his lady 's insanity , which was now universally believed , accounted for the secrecy with which she was to be removed from the Castle , and he reckoned on the same apology in case the unfortunate Amy 's resistance or screams should render such necessary . 
The agency of Anthony Foster was indispensable , and that Varney now went to secure . 
This person , naturally of a sour unsocial disposition , and somewhat tired , besides , with his journey from Cumnor to Warwickshire , in order to bring the news of the Countess 's escape , had early extricated himself from the crowd of wassailers , and betaken himself to his chamber , where he lay asleep , when Varney , completely equipped for travelling , and with a dark lantern in his hand , entered his apartment . 
He paused an instant to listen to what his associate was murmuring in his sleep , and could plainly distinguish the words , `` Ave Maria -- ora pro nobis -- No -- it runs not so -- deliver us from evil -- Ay , so it goes . '' 
`` Praying in his sleep , '' said Varney ; `` and confounding his old and new devotions -- He must have more need of prayer ere I am done with him . 
As Varney at the same time shook the sleeper by the arm , it changed the current of his ideas , and he roared out , `` Thieves ! 
said Varney ; `` art thou not ashamed of thy clamour ? '' 
Foster by this time was broad awake , and , sitting up in his bed , asked Varney the meaning of so untimely a visit . 
`` It augurs nothing good , '' he added . 
`` A false prophecy , most sainted Anthony , '' returned Varney ; `` it augurs that the hour is come for converting thy leasehold into copyhold -- What say ` st thou to that ? '' 
`` Ay , that -- and maybe a trifle more , '' answered Varney . 
`` Heed not my countenance , '' said Varney , `` you see it by this wretched light . 
`` Ay , Sir Richard , '' said Foster , `` you would take no advice . 
here is his signet , '' answered Varney ; and , having thus silenced the objections of his associate , they went together to Lord Hunsdon 's apartments , and , acquainting the sentinel with their purpose , as a matter sanctioned by the Queen and the Earl of Leicester , they entered the chamber of the unfortunate Countess . 
The horror of Amy may be conceived , when , starting from a broken slumber , she saw at her bedside Varney , the man on earth she most feared and hated . 
It was even a consolation to see that he was not alone , though she had so much reason to dread his sullen companion . 
`` Madam , '' said Varney , `` there is not time for ceremony . 
`` It is True , madam , '' replied Varney ; `` so true , that if you do not instantly arise , and prepare to attend us , we must compel you to obey our orders . '' 
`` That remains to be proved , madam , '' said Varney , who had determined on intimidation as the only means of subduing her high spirit ; `` if you put me to it , you will find me a rough groom of the chamber . '' 
Varney at the same time assured her of all safety and honour while in their hands , and promised , that he himself would not approach her , since his presence was so displeasing . 
Her husband , he added , would be at Cumnor-Place within twenty-four hours after they had reached it . 
She endeavoured to delay the completing her dress as long as she could , until , terrified by the impatience of Varney , she was obliged to declare herself ready to attend them . 
When they were about to move , the Countess clung to Foster with such an appearance of terror at Varney 's approach , that the latter protested to her , with a deep oath , that he had no intention whatever of even coming near her . 
`` If you do but consent to execute your husband 's will in quietness , you shall , '' he said , `` see but little of me . 
For thee , Varney , were it my latest word , thou art an equal stranger to both . '' 
Varney replied only , she was at liberty to choose , and walked some paces before them to show the way ; while , half leaning on Foster , and half carried by him , the Countess was transported from Saintlowe 's Tower to the postern-gate , where Tider waited with the litter and horses . 
She saw with some satisfaction , that while Foster and Tider rode close by the litter , which the latter conducted , the dreaded Varney lingered behind , and was soon lost in darkness . 
Besides the desire of inducing the Countess to proceed quietly on her journey , Varney had it also in view to have an interview with Lambourne , by whom he every moment expected to be joined , without the presence of any witnesses . 
He knew the character of this man , prompt , bloody , resolute , and greedy , and judged him the most fit agent he could employ in his farther designs . 
But ten miles of their journey had been measured ere he heard the hasty clatter of horse 's hoofs behind him , and was overtaken by Michael Lambourne . 
Fretted as he was with his absence , Varney received his profligate servant with a rebuke of unusual bitterness . 
`` Drunken villain , '' he said , `` thy idleness and debauched folly will stretch a halter ere it be long ; and , for me , I care not how soon ! '' 
Lord Leicester had detained him on some business of import , and that was enough for Varney , who was but a servant like himself . '' 
Varney was not a little surprised at his unusual tone of insolence ; but , ascribing it to liquor , suffered it to pass as if unnoticed , and then began to tamper with Lambourne , touching his willingness to aid in removing out of the Earl of Leicester 's way an obstacle to a rise , which would put it in his power to reward his trusty followers to their utmost wish . 
`` Look you , Sir Richard , and so forth , '' said Michael , `` some are wiser than some , that is one thing , and some are worse than some , that 's another . 
Here are his mandates , and his last words were , Michael Lambourne , -- for his lordship speaks to me as a gentleman of the sword , and useth not the words drunken villain , or such like phrases , of those who know not how to bear new dignities , -- Varney , says he , must pay the utmost respect to my Countess -- I trust to you for looking to it , Lambourne , says his lordship , and you must bring back my signet from him peremptorily . '' 
`` Ay , '' replied Varney , `` said he so , indeed ? 
`` And was there no one present , '' said Varney , `` when my lord so spoke ? '' 
`` Most true , '' said Varney ; and , making a pause , he looked forward on the moonlight road . 
He looked behind , and there was an expanse , lighted by the moonbeams , without one human being in sight . 
He resumed his speech to Lambourne : `` And will you turn upon your master , who has introduced you to this career of courtlike favour -- whose apprentice you have been , Michael -- who has taught you the depths and shallows of court intrigue ? '' 
said Varney ; and with a pistol , which he had for some time held in his hand , shot Lambourne through the body . 
The wretch fell from his horse , without a single groan ; and Varney , dismounting , rifled his pockets , turning out the lining , that it might appear he had fallen by robbers . 
He secured the Earl 's packet , which was his chief object , but he also took Lambourne 's purse , containing some gold pieces , the relics of what his debauchery had left him , and , from a singular combination of feelings , carried it in his hand only the length of a small river , which crossed the road , into which he threw it as far as he could fling . 
Such are the strange remnants of conscience which remain after she seems totally subdued , that this cruel and remorseless man would have felt himself degraded had he pocketed the few pieces belonging to the wretch whom he had thus ruthlessly slain . 
But Amy saw no chance of obtaining a hearing from any to whom she had an opportunity of addressing herself , and , besides , was too terrified for the presence of Varney , to violate the implied condition , under which she was to travel free from his company . 
The authority of Varney , often so used , during the Earl 's private journeys to Cumnor , readily procured relays of horses where wanted , so that they approached Cumnor-Place upon the night after they left Kenilworth . 
At this period of the journey , Varney came up to the rear of the litter , as he had done before repeatedly during their progress , and asked , `` What does she ? '' 
`` Rest will restore her , '' answered Varney . 
`` We will not trust them , however , friend Anthony , '' said Varney ; `` we must secure her in that stronghold where you keep your gold . '' 
This last consideration rendered Foster tractable ; he only asked permission to ride before , to make matters ready , and , spurring his horse , he posted before the litter , while Varney falling about three-score paces behind it , it remained only attended by Tider . 
Varney , meanwhile , had lurked behind on the stairs , but hearing the door barred , he now came up on tiptoe , and Foster , winking to him , pointed with self-complacence to a piece of concealed machinery in the wall , which , playing with much ease and little noise , dropped a part of the wooden gallery , after the manner of a drawbridge , so as to cut off all communication between the door of the bedroom , which he usually inhabited , and the landing-place of the high winding-stair which ascended to it . 
Varney looked with great attention at the machinery , and peeped more than once down the abyss which was opened by the fall of the trap-door . 
Varney cast once more a fixed and long look down into this sable gulf , and then followed Foster to the part of the manor-house most usually inhabited . 
When they arrived in the parlour which we have mentioned , Varney requested Foster to get them supper , and some of the choicest wine . 
The old woman assured Varney that Alasco had scarce eaten or drunken since her master 's departure , living perpetually shut up in the laboratory , and talking as if the world 's continuance depended on what he was doing there . 
`` I will teach him that the world hath other claims on him , '' said Varney , seizing a light , and going in quest of the alchemist . 
He returned , after a considerable absence , very pale , but yet with his habitual sneer on his cheek and nostril -- `` Our friend , '' he said , `` has exhaled . '' 
`` I will tell thee a surer way , '' said Varney . 
`` Ay , truly is he , '' said Varney ; `` and properly swoln already in the face and body -- He had been mixing some of his devil 's medicines , and the glass mask which he used constantly had fallen from his face , so that the subtle poison entered the brain , and did its work . '' 
`` Nay , I looked not but at the dead carrion , '' answered Varney ; `` an ugly spectacle -- he was swoln like a corpse three days exposed on the wheel -- Pah ! 
said he to Varney . 
said Varney ; `` I have seen and smelled enough to spoil my appetite . 
`` Still , if it were that Satan of thine , '' answered Varney , `` who thus jades thy imagination , thou art in perfect safety , unless he is a most unconscionable devil indeed . 
`` You will know in time , '' said Varney ; -- `` and then this other banquet -- but thou wilt esteem Her too choice a morsel for the fiend 's tooth -- she must have her psalms , and harps , and seraphs . '' 
Sir Richard , and must that then be done ? '' 
said Foster ; `` but how , Sir Richard , how ? 
`` I can not blame thee , '' said Varney ; `` I should be reluctant to do that myself -- we miss Alasco and his manna sorely ; ay , and the dog Lambourne . '' 
`` Ask no questions , '' said Varney , `` thou wilt see him one day , if thy creed is true . 
`` But were the lady to attempt an escape over it , '' replied Varney , `` her weight would carry it down ? '' 
On the next day , when evening approached , Varney summoned Foster to the execution of their plan . 
He left , therefore , the Countess 's door unsecured on the outside , and , under the eye of Varney , withdrew the supports which sustained the falling trap , which , therefore , kept its level position merely by a slight adhesion . 
At length Varney , after walking long to and fro , with his face muffled in his cloak , threw it suddenly back , and exclaimed , `` Surely never was a woman fool enough to neglect so fair an opportunity of escape ! '' 
-- most true , '' said Varney , rushing out , `` I had not thought of that before . '' 
At the same instant , Varney called in at the window , in an accent and tone which was an indescribable mixture betwixt horror and raillery , `` Is the bird caught ? 
`` Why , thou fool , '' said Varney , `` thy toil is ended , and thy reward secure . 
`` Varney , thou art an incarnate fiend ! '' 
`` So pass our troubles , '' said Varney , entering the room ; `` I dreamed not I could have mimicked the Earl 's call so well . '' 
`` Thou art a fanatical ass , '' replied Varney ; `` let us now think how the alarm should be given , -- the body is to remain where it is . '' 
But Varney was taken on the spot ; and , instead of expressing compunction for what he had done , seemed to take a fiendish pleasure in pointing out to them the remains of the murdered Countess , while at the same time he defied them to show that he had any share in her death . 
The despairing grief of Tressilian , on viewing the mangled and yet warm remains of what had lately been so lovely and so beloved , was such , that Raleigh was compelled to have him removed from the place by force , while he himself assumed the direction of what was to be done . 
Varney , upon a second examination , made very little mystery either of the crime or of its motives ; alleging , as a reason for his frankness , that though much of what he confessed could only have attached to him by suspicion , yet such suspicion would have been sufficient to deprive him of Leicester 's confidence , and to destroy all his towering plans of ambition . 
`` I was not born , '' he said , `` to drag on the remainder of life a degraded outcast , -- nor will I so die , that my fate shall make a holiday to the vulgar herd . '' 
From these words it was apprehended he had some design upon himself , and he was carefully deprived of all means by which such could be carried into execution . 
But like some of the heroes of antiquity , he carried about his person a small quantity of strong poison , prepared probably by the celebrated Demetrius Alasco . 
But as Varney in his last declaration had been studious to spare the character of his patron , the Earl was the object rather of compassion than resentment .
