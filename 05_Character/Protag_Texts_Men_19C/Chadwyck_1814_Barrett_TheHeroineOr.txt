It appeared that one of them -LRB- whose name was Jerry Sullivan -RRB- had assaulted the other , on the following occasion . 
A joint sum of money had lately been deposited in Sullivan 's hands , by this other , and a third man , his partner ; which sum Sullivan had consented to keep for them , and had bound himself to return , whenever both should go together to him , and demand it . 
Sometime afterwards , one of them went to him , and told him that the other , being ill , and therefore unable to come for the money , had empowered him -LRB- the partner -RRB- to get it . 
Sullivan , believing him , gave the money , and when he next met the other , mentioned the circumstance . 
The other denied having authorized the act , and demanded his own share of the deposit from Sullivan , who refused it . 
Words ensued , and Sullivan having knocked him down , was brought before the magistrate , to be committed for an assault . 
`` None that I know of , '' answered Sullivan , `` only my arm is subject to a kind of a sort of jerking spasm , ever since I was bewitched by Molly Cranahan the Fairy Woman ; so I do suppose it was a jerking spasm that knocked the man down . '' 
`` It is so , '' replied Sullivan , `` and I hope your worship likes it , as well as I like your worship . '' 
`` Why then , '' cried Sullivan , `` the heavens smile on you for a kind gentleman . '' 
`` Why then , '' cried Sullivan , `` the Devil inconvenience you for a big blackguard . '' 
`` And will your worship , '' said Sullivan , `` approve of this compromise , and stand umpire between us ? '' 
`` Well then , '' said Jerry to his accuser ; `` was not our agreement that I should return the money to yourself and your partner , whenever both of you came together to me , and asked for it ? '' 
`` Then I have not broken our agreement , '' cried Sullivan . 
`` No matter , '' cried Sullivan , `` provided I have it whenever both of you come together and demand it . 
The magistrate , after complimenting me upon my ingenious suggestion , confessed , he said , with much unwillingness , that Sullivan had made out his case clearly . 
The poor accuser was therefore obliged to abide by his covenant , and Sullivan was dismissed , snapping his fingers , and offering to treat the whole world with a tankard . 
`` The case is clear enough , '' said the magistrate , `` so now , Miss , try whether you can advocate your own cause as well as Jerry Sullivan 's . '' 
Jerry , who still remained in the room , came behind me , and whispered , `` Troth , Miss , I have no brains , but I have a bit of an oath , if that is of any use to you . 
Jerry followed me . 
`` Why then , '' cried he , shaking me heartily by the hand , as we walked along , `` only tell me how I can serve you , and 't is I that will ; though , to be sure , you must be the greatest little reprobate -LRB- bless your heart ! -RRB- 
`` I never heard of the title before , '' said Jerry , `` and I warrant 't is no better than it should be . '' 
`` Why then , much good may it do her , '' cried Jerry ; `` but in my mind , a tisicky girl is no great treasure ; and as to the fashion of living a month on a mouthful , let me have a potatoe and chop for my dinner , and a herring at nights , and I would not give a farthing for all the starvation you could offer me . 
cried Jerry ; `` but as I am a poor man , and not over particular , I can contrive to make shift with health and happiness , and to rub through life without binding my hair . 
`` By dad , '' said Jerry , `` that is the first of all ways to lose an acquaintance . '' 
Jerry jumped forward , and arrested his arm . 
`` No , in troth , '' said Jerry ; `` and the more you bid me , the more I wo n't let you go . '' 
`` If her ladyship has set her heart on a robbery , '' said Jerry , `` I am not the man to baulk her fancy . 
So saying , he snatched a parcel of bonnets from the counter , and was instantly knocked down by the shopman . 
He rose , and both began a furious conflict . 
In the midst of it , I was attempting to rush from the shop , when I found my spangled muslin barbarously grasped by the woman , who tore it to pieces in the struggle ; and pulling off the bonnet , pushed me into the street , just as Jerry had stunned his adversary with a blow . 
Taking this opportunity of escape , he dragged me through several streets without uttering a word . 
Jerry 's face was smeared with blood , nothing was on my head : my long locks were hanging loose about me , and my poor spangled muslin was all in rags . 
`` Here , '' said Jerry to an old woman who sold apples at a corner , `` take care of this young body , while I fetch her a coach . '' 
And off he ran . 
In the midst of the fray , Jerry returned with a coach . 
I sprang into it , and he after me . 
`` Drive like a devil , '' cried Jerry , `` and I will pay you like an emperor ! '' 
I write from Jerry 's house , where I have taken refuge for the present . 
Jerry Sullivan is a petty woollen-draper in St. Giles 's , and occupies the lower floor of a small house . 
At first his wife and daughter eyed me with some suspicion ; but when he told them how I had saved him from ruin , they became very civil , and gave me a tolerable breakfast . 
cried Jerry . 
`` I wo n't speak another word to you , '' said Jerry . 
`` I know , '' cried Jerry , `` that I gave you the last blow . '' 
`` Then take the first now , '' cried his wife , as I shut the door . 
Anticipating that I should probably have occasion for Jerry 's services again , I marked the number of his house , and then hastened along the street . 
I dared not venture back to my former lodgings , lest the conspirators there should keep me from the masquerade ; so having called a coach , I drove to Jerry Sullivan 's . 
`` Thank you , Jerry , '' said I. `` And pray is that the way you prove yourself grateful ? '' 
`` That same is the way , sure enough , '' cried Jerry . 
I write from his house ; but must soon conclude my letter , as the time for the masquerade is approaching . 
Having secured a comfortable bed at Jerry 's , and eaten something , I repaired in a coach , to the Pantheon ; and that faithful Irishman escorted me thither . 
We have now just returned to Jerry Sullivan 's . 
Then Stuart and I , having breakfasted , and remunerated our entertainers , set off for Lady Gwyn 's ; while Jerry ran at the side of the chaise , half way down the street , blessing me all over , and hoping that we might meet again in his house ; or if the worst came to the worst , in heaven . 
Jery Sullivan appeared the most eligible agent that I could select ; so now , a light heart making a light foot , I took my airy way towards Monkton Castle , for the purpose of procuring an asylum in some cottage near it , and of writing a letter to Jerry . 
As some days must elapse between my writing to Jerry Sullivan and his coming down -LRB- for I shall have him here if possible -RRB- , I mean to remain at the cottage , till his arrival ; and to go forth every day in the character of a beggar - girl . 
But my first step was a letter to Jerry Sullivan ; and fortunately , I found the stump of a pen , some thick ink , and coarse paper , in the cottage . 
`` Honest Jerry , `` Since I saw you last , I have established all my claims , and am now the Lady Cherubina de Willoughby , illustrious mistress of Gwyn Castle , Monkton Castle , and other estates . 
`` I have now to make a proposal , which , I hope and trust , Jerry , will meet your approbation . 
`` Should this proposal prove acceptable , have the goodness to call on my trusty servant , Jerry Sullivan , St. Giles 's and to accompany him down in my barouche . 
My heart beat high : the carriage approached , stopped ; and who should alight , but Higginson and Jerry Sullivan ! 
After Higginson , with reverence , and Jerry , with familiarity , had congratulated me on my restoration to my estates , the latter began looking hard at the castle . 
`` The people told us this was Monkton Castle , '' said he ; `` but where is the Monkton Castle that your Ladyship is to live in ? '' 
The postillion now came forward , with his hat in his hand . 
said he . 
`` That castle is my house , '' answered I. `` Begging your Ladyship 's pardon , '' said he ; `` what I mean is this : how far are we from where your Ladyship lives ? '' 
cried I. `` Oh , 't is only a way I have got , '' answered Jerry . 
And at every ` you know , ' he put his finger upon his nose , and winked . 
`` And sure 't is for your good I 'm grinning , '' cried he . 
said Jerry . 
`` Why then , '' said Jerry , '' 't is I that will spoil your looking for ever , if you do n't take the horses from the carriage , and set off with yourself in a twinkling . '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said I. `` Jerry , pay him . '' 
`` Deuce a rap have I , '' answered Jerry . 
`` I tell you what , Mr. Blow me ; '' cried Jerry , `` if you do n't unloose your horses this moment , and pack off , by the powers , the three of us will give you such a thrashing between us , as does ` nt often fall to an honest man 's share . '' 
The postillion took the horses from the carriage , in silence ; then , having mounted one of them , and ridden a few paces off , he stopped . 
`` You set of vagabonds and swindlers , '' cried he , `` without a roof over your heads , or a penny in your pockets , to go diddle me out of my day 's labour ! 
and away he cantered , ladyshipping it , till he was out of hearing . 
`` He wants his money , '' said Jerry ; `` and no blame to him . 
said he . 
`` Well , of all the wise freaks -- '' muttered Jerry , standing astride , sticking his knuckles in his ribs , and nodding his head leisurely , as he looked up at the castle . 
cried he . 
I shook his honest hand with warmth , and then asked him if he had performed my commissions . 
`` Your Ladyship shall hear , '' said he . 
cried I. `` All but one , '' said Jerry . 
`` Faith , then , by not shewing your letter , '' answered Jerry ; `` and by knowing the coachmaker myself . 
Jerry , therefore , procured some branches of trees ; and after much labour , and no small ingenuity , constructed a bedstead , as crazy as any that ever creaked under a heroine . 
He then hung it round with curtains of black cloth ; and his own bed being placed upon it , he spread the velvet pall , as a coverlet . 
Just at the close of evening , Jerry came running towards the castle , with a milk-pail upon his head . 
`` See , '' cried he , putting it down , `` how nicely I have choused a little milk-maid ! 
Though I was angry at the means used by Jerry to get the provisions , yet -LRB- as dinner , just then , had more charms for me than moral sentiment -RRB- , instead of instructing him in the lofty doctrines of the social compact , I merely shewed him how to pound the wheat between two flat stones . 
Meantime , I sent the Minstrel to the cottage , for a light and some fuel ; and on his return , made him kindle a fire of wood , in the centre of the Black Chamber . 
This accomplished , I mixed some milk with the bruised wheat , kneaded a cake , and laid it upon the red embers ; while Jerry himself took charge of roasting the potatoes . 
cried Jerry ; `` that would be a proper lie , because , as it happens , I was born in January ; and by the same token , I was one of the youngest children that ever was born , for I saw light five months after my mother 's marriage . 
Well , being born , up I grew , and the first word I said was mammy ; and my hair was quite yellow at first , though 't is so brown now ; and I promised to be handsome , but the symptoms soon left me ; and I remember , I was as proud as Lucifer , the first day I wore trowsers ; and -- '' `` Why now , Jerry , what sort of homely trash is this ? '' 
`` Oh , if 't is the wonderful you want , '' cried Jerry , `` I wo n't disappoint you . 
But as the devil would have it -- '' `` Jerry , '' said I , `` I must insist on hearing no more of these monstrous untruths . '' 
cried he . 
`` Then , ` pon my conscience , '' cried he , '' 't is as like your own story as two peas . 
` Now , Jerry , says he , -LRB- in Irish , -RRB- if any gentleman addresses you , of course it will be to know the price of your chickens ; so you must answer , three shillings , Sir . 
Then to be sure he will be for lowering the price ; so you must say stoutly , No less , Sir ; and if he shakes his head , or looks angry , 't is a sign he wo n't buy unless you bate a little ; so you are to say , I believe I must take two , Sir . ' 
`` Jerry , ' says he , ` here are the rebels attacking the house ; and as I know you are a faithful fellow , take this sword and pistol , and stand by me . ' 
says I. `` Why then , is that Jerry Sullivan ? ' 
says he . 
` You are one of us , ' says he , ` so now turn round and shoot your master , ' says he . 
said I. `` Ah , Jerry , these famous adventures of your 's are ending in nothing . '' 
`` Wait awhile , '' said Jerry . 
`` Why , '' said he , `` the Red Sea is as red as blood , and the Black Sea is as black as ink , and the White Sea is the colour of new milk , or nearer butter-milk , I think ; and the Pacifi-ifi -- What 's that word ? '' 
said he . 
`` It means peaceful or calm , '' answered I. `` Gad , I thought so , '' cried he , `` for the devil a wave that same ocean had on it at all at all . 
`` Take care , Jerry , '' said I , laughing ; `` I am afraid -- '' `` Why then , '' cried he , `` that I may never -- '' `` Hush ! '' 
`` By dad , '' cried he , `` at this rate you had better tell me my own story yourself ; for you seem bent upon having it all just as you like . 
`` Why , then , '' said he , `` I made a little money by reaping , and afterwards , I trudged to London . '' 
asked I. `` By spitting through my teeth , '' said Jerry . 
`` Take care , '' cried I. `` This I susspect is another -- '' `` If you mean lie , '' said Jerry , `` you are out at last . 
`` Why , '' said he , `` going home sorrowful enough , after the ruin of our club , I resolved to drown care in drink ; and accordingly turned into a porterhouse ; where I found three fruit-women from Covent Garden , bound on the same errand . '' 
`` And then they fell a fighting and scratching ; and Anniseed-water -LRB- the present Mrs. Jerry Sullivan -RRB- was getting well cuffed , when I came to her assistance . 
cried he . 
cried Jerry . 
I rose early this morning , and summoned Jerry to the Black Chamber ; for my head was teeming with the most important projects . 
`` Why then , now , speaking in all sober reason , '' said Jerry , `` who but madmen would come , as servants , to a house without a roof ? 
`` Well , from this moment , I say nothing , '' cried Jerry . 
`` So now , your Ladyship , how many of these same feudal Vessels , as you call 'em ; -- these Vessels that are to have no drink -- '' `` Jerry ! 
`` Ay , or they could not live in an old -- '' But Jerry clapped his hand upon his mouth just in time , and then ran down stairs . 
During his absence , I paid a visit to the poor cottagers ; and after having sat with them awhile , and promised them assistance before evening , I returned towards the castle . 
On approaching it , I perceived , to my great surprise , Jerry also advancing , at the head of about twenty men , armed with bludgeons . 
cried Jerry . 
But as minstrels never wear hats , and are always bald ; and as Higginson still cherished his locks , with a spruceness most unmeet for minstrelsy , I persuaded him , after repeated assurances how much handsomer he would look , to let Jerry shave the crown of his head . 
Then suddenly , lifting a prodigious stone , he whirled it at Jerry 's head ; who ducked for his life , and saved it . 
cried Jerry . 
I tried to sooth him ; but he turned from me with a froward shoulder , mounted the turret again , and continued sobbing there , as long as I remained . 
Jerry , whose hat I had distinguished with three feathers ; and on whose black cloak I had fastened a scarlet cape , headed the whole . 
cried Jerry , `` will you refuse so good an offer , after starving all the morning ! '' 
exclaimed Lady Gwyn , `` We have not put a morsel inside our mouths this blessed day , '' said Jerry ; `` and even yesterday we dined upon potatoes and milk , and a sort of a contrivance of a cake , that your Ladyship would ` nt throw to your cat . '' 
I thought I should drop at this exposure of our poverty , and I commanded him to be silent . 
`` Time enough for silence when one has spoken , '' cried he . 
`` Mr. Warden , '' answered I quickly , lest he should speak again . 
`` And for all this fine talk , '' cried Jerry , `` we have not so much as a rap farthing amongst the whole set of us ! 
Or may be , '' -LRB- said he , getting closer and whispering -RRB- , `` may he you would just lend her half-a-crown or so ; -- do now , and , ` pon my soul , I will pay you myself before this day week . '' 
`` And now is it true , '' cried Jerry to Lady Gwyn , `` that the poor soul is really mistress of this house ? '' 
`` Well , bad luck to me , if ever I believed it , till this moment , '' cried Jerry . 
cried Jerry . 
answered I. `` And so , '' cried he to Lady Gwyn , `` you wo n't make her mistress of it ? '' 
`` Why then , '' cried Jerry , `` since one refuses to dine in it till she is mistress of it ; and since t ` other owns , that she ought to be mistress of it , and yet wo n't make her mistress of it ; by the powers , 't is I will make her mistress of it in half a shake ! '' 
So saying , he shouted some words of an uncouth jargon -LRB- Irish , I suppose -RRB- to my Vassals , several of whom instantly darted into the house ; while others began brandishing their sticks in the faces of the guests . 
Jerry himself ran , lifted me from the barouche , and bore me into the hall ; the rest beat back the gentlemen who were attempting to rush between us and the door , and then entered after us . 
Jerry set me down , shut the door , and told me that I was now in quiet possession for ever and ever . 
`` Jerry , '' said I , `` there is no knowing how this will end . 
cried Jerry . 
`` We shall have a bloody battle of it , '' said Jerry . 
`` By the mother that bore me , '' cried Jerry , `` I will defend the house in spite of you ! '' 
cried Jerry , `` and may all the -- Oh ! 
`` Well , Jerry , '' cried I , in a cheering tone . 
`` Well , Jerry , my lad ! '' 
`` Well , Ma'am , '' said Jerry . 
said Jerry . 
`` I think , '' said Jerry , `` it was the bluest business that ever a set of chicken-hearted poltroons botched amongst them ! '' 
`` Come back , dear Jerry , '' cried I. `` Here is my hand . 
I proposed assembling and haranguing the tenantry : Jerry suggested a petition to the charitable and humane . 
At last , after a long silence , he suddenly touched his forehead with his finger : `` I have a thought ! '' 
said he . 
The casket was produced , off he set ; and I proceeded homeward with my vassals . 
Well , a n't Jerry Sullivan the fellow after all ? '' 
cried Jerry . 
cried Jerry , running towards him . 
`` Because you treat me like one ; '' whimpered he , `` while you treat him like a man . '' 
`` Arrah , '' cried Jerry , `` rouse yourself from your snivelling jealousies , and give us a shake of the fist . '' 
`` Or in plain English , '' said Jerry , `` a word to the heart is better than a blow at the head . 
`` Troth , then , '' said Jerry , `` that must be no small compliment , since they are so brackish and so scalding . 
Well , if I took such a dose of tears , I would be after seasoning it with a dram , or my name is not Jerry . '' 
`` And , indeed , I wish Jerry were not your name , '' said I. '' 'T is so vulgar for a Warden . 
I have often thought of altering it to Jeronymo ; which , I fancy , is the Italian for Jerry . 
Nothing can equal Italian names ending in O. '' `` Except Irish names beginning with O , '' cried Jerry . 
`` I will tell you what is finer , '' said Jerry . 
`` Jerry , Jerry , '' said I ; `` run down to the Blàck Chamber , and clean it out quick . 
At last , when I supposed that Jerry had regulated the room above , I conducted his Lordship up stairs ; while I anxiously anticipated his delight at beholding so legendary , fatal , and inconvenient a chamber . 
His astonishment , indeed , was excessive . 
He stared round and round , admired the hangings , the pictures , the bed , the nettles ; every thing . 
`` I see , '' said he , approaching the ashes , `` that you are even classical enough to burn a fire of wood . 
cried Jerry , sure 't is nothing at all at all , but the blade-bone of mutton , which was broiled for your supper last night ! '' 
`` Impossible , Sir , '' said his Lordship . 
`` Pray , Mr. Blunderer , '' whispered I to Jerry , `` did I not bid you clean out the room ? '' 
`` You did ` nt say a word about the blade-bone , '' answered Jerry . 
repeated I. `` Do n't I tell you -- '' cried Jerry . 
`` Now curse me , '' said he , `` if you a n't all this time confounding the blade-bone of mutton , with the leg of mutton , that you bade me put under the bed . 
`` And accordingly , '' whispered he , `` I put it under the velvet pall , ' cause I thought it might be seen under the bed . '' 
`` Well , that , at least , shewed some sort of discretion , '' said I. `` Though , with all my pains , '' said Jerry , `` there is the man in the tin clothes , has just stripped down that same pall , and discovered the mutton , and the saucepan , and the bag of salt , and the pewter spoons , and the brandy bottle , and the -- '' `` Oh , Jerry , Jerry ! '' 
I then called his Lordship , and drew off his attention , by commencing an account of what had happened me , since our parting . 
He listened with great eagerness ; and , after my recital , begged of the Warden to accompany him down stairs , that they might consult together , upon my present situation . 
and Jerry crying , `` grin and bear it ! '' 
Down I hastened ; and beheld Jerry belabouring that nobleman ; whose mouth was already gushing blood . 
`` Not till I beat a rainbow into his face ! '' 
cried Jerry . 
to go and offer me half your fortune , if I would assist him in running away with you . '' 
cried his Lordship . 
said I. `` So now , Sullivan , take your choice -- ask pardon , or quit my service , this very moment . '' 
`` But can his asking pardon , restore the teeth he has knocked down my throat ? '' 
exclaimed his Lordship , with a finger in his mouth . 
`` Two teeth , '' lisped he . 
`` Two front upper teeth , '' lisped he again . 
cried he . 
`` See yourself , '' cried he , lifting his lip . 
cried he . 
cried he , starting . 
shouted he . 
`` By Heaven , '' cried he ; `` I can get other teeth at a Dentist 's ; -- a composition of paste , which would amaze you ! 
exclaimed he ; `` I am more desperate than despair ! 
He commenced a tremendous imprecation ; but was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a gentleman on horseback , with two servants after him . 
I beheld Jerry , with several Vassals , come running towards us . 
They reach us : the tide of battle turns ; his Lordship and the servants are well beaten with bludgeons , and Jerry himself does the honours to Betterton , in a kicking . 
`` Now , '' said I , `` I constitute you , Sullivan , Commander of the forces ; and you , Higginson , Commander of the Castle . 
Go , Sullivan , dispatch scouts , plant sentinels and outposts , repair the breaches , and blockade the windows with stones . '' 
`` Silence , lads , '' cried Jerry , breaking into full brogue , `` and I will make a bit of a speech ; but as to the long words her Ladyship used , I got a surfeit of 'em once , so I 'll pass 'em over now ; tho ' I do suppose her honourable Ladyship meant all for the best . 
Jerry , therefore , called in both the wings , and strengthened the centre . 
Jerry led the van . 
Jerry marched back , holding Montmorenci fast ; the troops followed , escorting eight other prisoners , and Higginson , with his leg of mutton , worn to the bone , brought up the rear . 
Palpitating with transport , I commanded Jerry to tie the prisoners ' hands behind their backs ; to place sentinels over them , and to confine them in the Green Chamber of the Northern Tower . 
said Jerry , `` his feet in particular ; for though he talks big , he runs fast . 
Leaving Jerry to perform this office , I descended , and found my men within the walls , wiping their faces , and bandaging their wounds ; but they forgot all in their cordial greetings . 
Next , I placed ten men , under Higginson , within the doorway , to guard the stairs ; two to watch the prisoners in the Black Chamber ; and the remainder , under Jerry , to man the battlements above . 
At length the enemy began his march . 
I thanked them in silent gestures and tears of joy ; and Jerry exclaimed : `` Well , mistress , was n't burning the hay a fine device ? 
cried Jerry , `` a word beginning that way will never do . 
`` Nay , my honest fellow -- '' `` Never honest-fellow me , '' cried Jerry . 
cried Jerry , `` if you 're for boiling , go boil your own tongue hard , like a calve 's , and then it wo n't wag so glib and sly ; -- ay , and go boil that nose of your 's white , like veal . 
`` Jerry , '' said I , `` dear Jerry , we must surrender . '' 
exclaimed Jerry , `` Why then , death alive , for what ? '' 
cried he ; `` poo , do as I do . 
`` None , '' said he , blushing through his very eyeballs . 
`` We must surrender , '' said Jerry , shaking his head . 
Before Jerry departed , however , I promised to call upon him in London , after the expiration of the twenty-four hours . 
When Jerry had marched almost out of sight , he halted his men , faced them towards the castle and made them give three last and parting cheers . 
However , judging by the description which her Ladyship gave , that Sullivan was one of my party , back he posted to London , and sought out Jerry . 
Jerry , who had only just returned from the castle , told him all ; and acquainted him with my promise of calling at the shop , the moment of my arrival in town . 
He therefore saw the coachmaker , paid him for the barouche , informed him that I was not a swindler , and brought Jerry to depose , that Betterton and Grundy were the persons who had assaulted the constables . 
Honest Jerry Sullivan -LRB- whom Stuart has enabled to set up a handsome shop -RRB- , was at the house before me .
