`` Why , how many legs have our citizen hogs , as you call them , Monsieur ? '' 
are you going to New-Orleans , Monsieur ? '' 
Pray , '' said he , turning to the communicative traveller , `` will Monsieur be good enough to tell me whether I am travelling north or south , to New-Orleans or Passamaquoddy ? '' 
`` Due north -- in the very eye of the North star -- to Passamaquoddy , and not to New-Orleans , Monsieur , '' answered the other . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the little villain , turning to me , and offering a pinch of snuff with a low bow -- `` Monsieur , when you get into a stage coach , do you ever condescend to inquire where it is going ? 
However , Monsieur , it is an ill wind that blows nobody good . 
I am going no farther North than this place , shall finish my business here this afternoon , and to-morrow , if Monsieur pleases , we will set out for the South , which I assure you is the very best way to New-Orleans . '' 
`` Pray , Monsieur , what a clock is it ? '' 
`` He must have his pockets full of guineas , '' said the little Frenchman in a whisper , winking at the same time at the communicative traveller . 
In one of these I overheard the landlady say , in reply to some question of the communicative traveller , who seemed to be an old acquaintance , `` we killed him last night , poor old creature ; I was almost sorry for him . '' 
exclaimed the little Frenchman , stooping down to examine the body , `` he has killed our driver . '' 
`` Not exactly , '' cried the fellow , jumping on his two legs as brisk as a grasshopper -- `` but if I do n't have him up before the justice for shooting at a fellow for only coming in to light his lantern , to see to put together his horses , darn my soul . '' 
Here 's Monsieur Tonson come again ! '' 
Monsieur , I am so happy ! 
Monsieur , '' cried the little Frenchman , `` you do n't know how we have missed your agreeable society . 
`` Is Monsieur ill ? '' 
If Monsieur has no money , never mind , I will pay for his dinner . '' 
`` I hope Monsieur , my friend and myself shall take lodgings together . 
I assure you I shall not rob Monsieur , '' said he , with an impertinent , significant smile . 
replied he , `` is Monsieur going to New-Orleans again ? 
But in truth we are sorry to lose your very agreeable company , Monsieur , and hope we shall meet again when you come back from New-Orleans . '' 
It is a proof of the generous credulity of honest John Bull that he still continues to trust , and be cheated by the turbulent spirit of democracy , as the editors of the Quarterly Review justly style it , in their usual strain of genteel irony . 
Relating the story of my disappointment to my worthy landlord , I thought he looked rather shy , as if he expected it to be the prelude to a long score . 
But I at once satisfied his doubts by showing him a few guineas , and telling him I always paid my bill every Saturday night . 
He then resumed his confidence , and proceeded to let me into the secrets of this unprincipled and profligate city , which being the general rendezvous of people from all parts of this puissant and polished republic , -LRB- as the Quarterly calls it , -RRB- presents at one view a picture of the blessings of pure and undefiled democracy . 
exclaimed the little Frenchman , `` here is our old friend , Monsieur John Bull , the agreeable gentleman , come again . 
Somebody must be robbing him beyond doubt . 
Let us rescue him by all means . '' 
`` By a little mahogany-faced Frenchman and a communicative traveller , '' answered I. `` Monsieur is under a grand mistake , '' cried the little Frenchman . 
`` By no means , '' cried the little Frenchman -- `` Monsieur has only been reading the Quarterly Review , and is a little afraid of the spirit of democracy . 
He shall shoot him one day with a silver bullet . '' 
`` I came , '' replied the bandit , `` from New-Orleans , which , as Monsieur knows -LRB- making me a low bow -RRB- is not far from Portsmouth , in Alabama . 
I am going to Charleston , to which place I hope to have the pleasure of Monsieur 's company , -LRB- making me another low bow ;-RRB- my business , it seems , is principally to rob and murder Monsieur , -LRB- another bow , -RRB- and I came to put him in bodily fear , by reason of sharpening my razors at night , which I generally do before I shave myself ; '' making me another low bow , and offering his box . 
cried the little man , `` what is the matter -- what has Monsieur John Bull done , that you will knock him down , eh ? '' 
`` I am wrong , '' said he , `` because he is a stranger I perceive . 
Had he been one of my own countrymen , I would have lickedhim for his ill manners . '' 
`` Why , what did Monsieur do ? '' 
`` I spoke to him twice , and he would not answer me . 
He was a stranger and alone , and I thought I would speak to him . '' 
said the little man , `` do n't you know this is the great Monsieur John Bull , the bulwark of religion , the grand restorer of the liberties of Europe , who gained the battle of Waterloo all by himself , and who is the most learned , polite , and refined gentleman , in the whole world ? 
We were just roasting a John Bull for not drinking his allowance of whiskey , when these gentry thought proper to interfere , but we soon did their business . '' 
Just as I left the box , I heard the little Frenchman say in reply to some question , `` Monsieur is not mad -- diable ! 
`` There is a way , Monsieur , '' quoth the little Frenchman with an insinuating diabolical smile . 
`` Well , if Monsieur will neither appeal to posterity , nor to the immortal gods , there is no more to be said . 
`` I am sorry , to lose Monsieur 's agreeable company -- but as I am going north , and Monsieur south , who knows but we may meet again ? '' 
` To the end of the world , John , ' replied she ; and away we scampered the next day . 
` To the end of the world , John , ' said the brave girl . 
-- what is that , friend John ? '' 
If thou talkest Latin here , nobody will understand thee , friend John . 
That will be a bad speculation , friend John . 
quoth the old quaker , with a sly glance at his round portly figure ; `` I have lived upon them all my life , and never made the discovery , friend John . '' 
` Thee should set them to reading Sir Humphrey Davy , friend John , ' quoth my neighbour -- ` they hav 'n' t learning enough to relish thy Latin turnips . ' 
` I am sorry for thy loss friend John , ' said the old quaker , ` but I told thee our earth was not strong enough for a beast with such little short legs , and such a huge body . ' 
` Thy cattle are rather lean , friend John , ' said he , ` but there is one comfort , they will not sink into the marshes and perish , like thy fat Teeswater bull . ' 
` John , ' said the old quaker , ` what art thou about this season ? 
`` Friend John , thou wilt never prosper till thou callest things by their honest christian names . 
John , John , '' exclaimed the old quaker , `` remember thy turnips with the Latin name . '' 
Every time I went to the quaker to borrow money , he would say , after letting me have it , -- ` Friend John , thee hadst better plant corn and sow wheat and rye , as we do , though they do n't contain quite so much of the saccharine matter . ' 
The old quaker came to me one day , when the thermometer was at ninety , and said in his sly way -- ` Friend John , if thee is cold , I will lend thee my great coat , for verily it is a bitter day , for the season . ' 
I took no notice of what he said , for though I really did feel a little uncomfortable , it would have been too great a triumph to these people , to see me adopting any of their notions . 
` Friend John , ' said he , ` hast thou ever read in Sir Humphrey Davy , or any of thine oracles , that borrowing day is always sooner or later followed by payday ? 
`` Hearing of this , the old quaker came to me and said : -- ` Friend John , if thou goest on in this way , thy farm will , by-and-by , be without wood , and will not sell for wherewithal to pay my mortgages . 
He did so ; my farm was sold at public sale by the sheriff , and bought in by the old quaker to save himself from loss . 
When I was on the point of quitting the neighbourhood , he came to me and said : ` Friend John , thou art going away among strangers without money . 
Farewell , friend John , I wish thee better success another time . '' '
