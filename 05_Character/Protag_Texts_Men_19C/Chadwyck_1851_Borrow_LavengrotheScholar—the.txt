`` Get back with you , Belle , Moll , '' said the man , still staring at me , `` here 's something not over canny or comfortable . '' 
`` Stay , Belle , '' said the man , putting himself before the young virago , who was about to rush upon me , `` my turn is first '' -- then , advancing to me in a menacing attitude , he said , with a look of deep malignity , ``` Afraid ' was the word , was n't it ? '' 
`` Hands off , Belle , '' said the other woman ; `` do you call it fair play to interfere ? 
But Belle paid no heed to the injunction , and tugged so hard at the handkerchief , that the Flaming Tinman was nearly throttled ; suddenly relinquishing his hold of me , he started on his feet , and aimed a blow at my fair preserver , who avoided it , but said coolly : -- `` Finish t ` other business first , and then I 'm your woman whenever you like ; but finish it fairly -- no foul play when I 'm by -- I 'll be the boy 's second , and Moll can pick up you when he happens to knock you down . '' 
`` I can never stand this , '' said I , as I sat on the knee of Belle , `` I am afraid I must give in ; the Flaming Tinman hits very hard , '' and I spat out a mouthful of blood . 
said Belle , picking me up . 
`` Why , this long right of yours , '' said Belle , feeling my right arm ; `` if you do , I should ` nt wonder if you yet stand a chance . '' 
I heard Belle exclaim ; `` there is nothing like Long Melford for shortness , all the world over . '' 
During this proceeding Belle had stood looking on without saying anything ; at last , perceiving that the man had harnessed his horse to the other cart , and that both he and the woman were about to take their departure , she said , `` You are not going , are you ? '' 
Arrived there , I found Belle seated on the stone by the fire-place . 
Her hair was all dishevelled , and she was in tears . 
`` They were bad people , '' said she , `` and I did not like them , but they were my only acquaintance in the wide world . '' 
I found Belle seated by a fire , over which her kettle was suspended . 
During my absence she had prepared herself a kind of tent , consisting of large hoops covered over with tarpauling , quite impenetrable to rain , however violent . 
`` I am glad you are returned , '' said she , as soon as she perceived me ; `` I began to be anxious about you . 
`` I knew it would do you good , '' said Belle ; `` I remembered that when the poor women in the great house were afflicted with hysterics , and fearful imaginings , the surgeon , who was a good kind man , used to say , ` Ale , give them ale , and let it be strong . 
Thereupon Belle prepared tea , and , as we were taking it , she said -- `` What did you see and hear at the public-house ? '' 
`` It matters very little to me , '' said Belle ; `` I merely inquired of you , for the sake of a little conversation -- you were silent , and it is uncomfortable for two people to sit together without opening their lips -- at least I think so . '' 
`` Really , young man , '' said Belle , `` you are not over complimentary ; but who may this wonderful company have been -- some young ... ? '' 
and here Belle stopped . 
said Belle . 
Belle looked at me for a moment , and then appeared to be lost in thought -- `` America ! '' 
said she , musingly -- `` America ! '' 
`` I heard nothing about that , '' said Belle ; `` what I heard was , that it is a great and goodly land , where people can walk about without jostling , and where the industrious can always find bread ; I have frequently thought of going thither . '' 
`` I shall go by myself , '' said Belle , `` unless -- unless that should happen which is not likely -- I am not fond of Radicals no more than I am of scoffers and mockers . '' 
`` I do n't wish to say you are , '' said Belle ; `` but some of your words sound strangely like scoffing and mocking . 
`` I ca n't speak with you , '' said Belle ; `` but I see you dislike the country . '' 
said Belle . 
said Belle . 
Belle , I have determined to give you lessons in Armenian . '' 
said Belle . 
`` I am afraid we shall have to part company before I have learnt it , '' said Belle ; `` in the mean time , if I wish to say anything to you in private , somebody being by , shall I speak in the language of the roads ? '' 
Belle , I will now give you a lesson in Armenian . '' 
`` I suppose you mean no harm , '' said Belle . 
`` Stop till I have removed the tea things , '' said Belle ; and , getting up , she removed them to her own encampment . 
`` I am ready , '' said Belle , returning , and taking her former seat , `` to join with you in anything which will serve to pass away the time agreeably , provided there is no harm in it . '' 
`` Belle , '' said I , `` I have determined to commence the course of Armenian lessons by teaching you the numerals ; but , before I do that , it will be as well to tell you that the Armenian language is called Haik . '' 
`` I am sure that word will hang upon my memory , '' said Belle . 
said Belle . 
`` I only remember number one , '' said Belle , `` and that because it is me . '' 
Belle , I am afraid I shall have some difficulty with you as a scholar . '' 
Belle made no answer . 
Her eyes were turned in the direction of the winding path which led from the bottom of the hollow , where we were seated , to the plain above . 
`` Gorgio shunella , '' she said , at length , in a low voice . 
`` Dovey odoi , '' said Belle , nodding with her head towards the path . 
Thereupon I conducted the man in black to the fire-place , where Belle was standing , who had risen from her stool on my springing up to go in quest of the stranger . 
The man in black looked at her with evident curiosity , then making her rather a graceful bow , `` Lovely virgin , '' said he , stretching out his hand , `` allow me to salute your fingers . '' 
`` I am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers , '' said Belle . 
`` I never permit anything of the kind , '' said Belle , `` I do not approve of such unmanly ways , they are only befitting those who lurk in corners or behind trees , listening to the conversation of people who would fain be private . '' 
`` Ay , indeed I do , '' said Belle ; `` the young man may receive your excuses , and put confidence in them if he please , but for my part I neither admit them , nor believe them ; '' and thereupon flinging her long hair back , which was hanging over her cheeks , she seated herself on her stool . 
`` Come , Belle , '' said I , `` I have bidden the gentleman welcome , `` I beseech you , therefore , to make him welcome ; he is a stranger , where we are at home , therefore , even did we wish him away , we are bound to treat him kindly . '' 
The man in black , after proffering two or three excuses for occupying what he supposed to be my seat , sat down upon the stone , and I squatted down , gypsy fashion , just opposite to him , Belle sitting on her stool at a slight distance on my right . 
`` A bad countenance , '' said Belle , in the language of the roads , observing that my eyes were fixed on his face . 
`` So do I , perhaps , '' retorted Belle ; `` and , to tell you the truth , I like your tone as little as your face . '' 
`` Belle , '' said I , after the man in black had departed , `` we did not treat that man very hospitably ; he left us without having eaten or drunk at our expense . '' 
`` You offered him some tea , '' said Belle , `` which , as it is mine , I should have grudged him , for I like him not . '' 
Belle , do you know where to procure any good Hollands ? '' 
`` I think I do , '' said Belle , `` but ... '' `` I will have no buts . 
Belle , I expect that with as little delay as possible you procure , at my expense , the best Hollands you can find . '' 
Time passed on , and Belle and I lived in the dingle ; when I say lived , the reader must not imagine that we were always there . 
She went out upon her pursuits , and I went out where inclination led me ; but my excursions were very short ones , and hers occasionally occupied whole days and nights . 
If I am asked how we passed the time when we were together in the dingle , I would answer that we passed the time very tolerably , all things considered ; we conversed together , and when tired of conversing I would sometimes give Belle a lesson in Armenian ; her progress was not particularly brilliant , but upon the whole satisfactory ; in about a fortnight she had hung up one hundred Haikan numerals upon the hake of her memory . 
I found her conversation highly entertaining ; she had seen much of England and Wales , and had been acquainted with some of the most remarkable characters who travelled the roads at that period ; and let me be permitted to say that many remarkable characters have travelled the roads of England , of whom fame has never said a word . 
I loved to hear her anecdotes of these people ; some of whom I found had occasionally attempted to lay violent hands either upon her person or effects , and had invariably been humbled by her without the assistance of either justice or constable . 
I could clearly see , however , that she was rather tired of England , and wished for a change of scene ; she was particularly fond of talking of America , to which country her aspirations chiefly tended . 
She had heard much of America , which had excited her imagination ; for at that time America was much talked of , on roads and in homesteads -- at least , so said Belle , who had good opportunities of knowing -- and most people allowed that it was a good country for adventurous English . 
The people who chiefly spoke against it , as she informed me , were soldiers disbanded upon pensions , the sextons of village churches , and excisemen . 
Belle had a craving desire to visit that country , and to wander with cart and little animal amongst its forests : when I would occasionally object , that she would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse customers , she said that she had not wandered the roads of England so long and alone , to be afraid of anything which might befall in America ; and that she hoped , with God 's favour , to be able to take her own part , and to give to perverse customers as good as they might bring . 
She had a dauntless heart , that same Belle . 
Such was the staple of Belle 's conversation . 
As for mine , I would endeavour to entertain her with strange dreams of adventure , in which I figured in opaque forests , strangling wild beasts , or discovering and plundering the hoards of dragons ; and sometimes I would narrate to her other things far more genuine -- how I had tamed savage mares , wrestled with Satan , and had dealings with ferocious publishers . 
Belle had a kind heart , and would weep at the accounts I gave her of my early wrestling with the dark Monarch . 
She would sigh , too , as I recounted the many slights and degradations I had received at the hands of ferocious publishers ; but she had the curiosity of a woman ; and once , when I talked to her of the triumphs which I had achieved over unbroken mares , she lifted up her head and questioned me as to the secret of the virtue which I possessed over the aforesaid animals ; whereupon I sternly reprimanded , and forthwith commanded her to repeat the Armenian numerals ; and , on her demurring , I made use of words , to escape which she was glad to comply , saying the Armenian numerals from one to a hundred , which numerals , as a punishment for her curiosity , I made her repeat three times , loading her with the bitterest reproaches whenever she committed the slightest error , either in accent or pronunciation , which reproaches she appeared to bear with the greatest patience . 
One evening Belle and myself received another visit from the man in black . 
After a little conversation of not much importance , I asked him whether he would not take some refreshment , assuring him that I was now in possession of some very excellent Hollands , which , with a glass , a jug of water , and a lump of sugar , were heartily at his service ; he accepted my offer , and Belle going with a jug to the spring , from which she was in the habit of procuring water for tea , speedily returned with it full of the clear , delicious water of which I have already spoken . 
He then made Belle a low bow , slightly motioned to me with his hand as if bidding farewell , and then left the dingle with rather uneven steps . 
Belle drove the little cart containing her merchandise about the neighbourhood , returning to the dingle towards the evening . 
As for myself , I kept within my wooded retreat , working during the periods of her absence leisurely at my forge . 
On the third day Belle arrived somewhat later than usual ; I was lying on my back at the bottom of the dingle , employed in tossing up the shoes which I had produced , and catching them as they fell -- some being always in the air mounting or descending , somewhat after the fashion of the waters of a fountain . 
said I to Belle , `` it must be long past four by the day . '' 
`` I have been almost killed by the heat , '' said Belle ; `` I was never out in a more sultry day -- the poor donkey , too , could scarcely move along . '' 
said Belle . 
`` One has now fallen on your chin , '' said Belle . 
Belle went to her own little encampment ; and as for myself , after having flung the donkey 's shoes into my tent , I put some fresh wood on the fire , which was nearly out , and hung the kettle over it . 
`` I am fond of sitting by a wood fire , '' said Belle , `` when abroad , whether it be hot or cold ; I love to see the flames dart out of the wood ; but what kind is this , and where did you get it ? '' 
`` That makes good the old rhyme , '' said Belle , `` which I have heard sung by the old women in the great house : -- `` And on fairer form of queen , ash fire never shone , '' said I , `` than on thine , O beauteous queen of the dingle . '' 
`` I am half disposed to be angry with you , young man , '' said Belle . 
said I. Belle made no reply . 
`` Something less would content me , '' said Belle , sighing , as she rose to prepare our evening meal . 
So we took tea together , Belle and I. `` How delicious tea is after a hot summer 's day , and a long walk , '' said she . 
Belle sighed . 
she presently demanded . 
said Belle . 
`` That 's your affair , not mine , '' said Belle ; `` it seems hard that the master should ask the scholar . '' 
Belle , there are ten declensions in Armenian ! '' 
Belle , I insist on your declining an Armenian noun . '' 
`` I have done so already , '' said Belle . 
`` I do n't like the language , '' said Belle . 
`` Welsh , I have heard , is vulgar , '' said Belle ; `` so , if I must learn one of the two , I will prefer Armenian , which I never heard of till you mentioned it to me ; though , of the two , I really think Welsh sounds best . '' 
`` I neither like the word nor the sound , '' said Belle . 
Come , let us begin -- `` A master.Of a master , & c. Repeat -- '' `` I am not much used to say the word , '' said Belle , `` but to oblige you I will decline it as you wish ; '' and thereupon Belle declined Master in Armenian . 
said Belle `` That which implies more than one , for example , Masters ; you shall now go through masters in Armenian . '' 
`` Never , '' said Belle , `` never ; it is bad to have one master , but more I would never bear , whether in Armenian or English . '' 
`` My dislike is not pretended , '' said Belle ; `` I hate the sound of it , but I love my tea , and it was kind of you not to wish to cast a cloud over my little pleasures ; the thunder came quite time enough to interrupt it without being anticipated -- there is another peal -- I will clear away , and see that my tent is in a condition to resist the storm ; and I think you had better bestir yourself . '' 
Isopel departed , and I remained seated on my stone , as nothing belonging to myself required any particular attention ; in about a quarter of an hour she returned , and seated herself upon her stool . 
`` How dark the place is become since I left you , '' said she ; `` just as if night were just at hand . '' 
`` We shall have plenty anon , '' said Belle ; `` do you hear ? 
`` Go in , '' said Belle , `` but you go in alone ; as for me , I will seek my own . '' 
`` You almost tempt me , '' said Belle , `` to make you decline mistress in English . '' 
said Belle , angrily . 
`` The rain is increasing , '' said Belle . 
`` Nor I of you , '' said Belle ; `` so I will come . 
`` I hope we shall not be flooded in this hollow , '' said I to Belle . 
`` There is no fear of that , '' said Belle ; the wandering people , amongst other names , call it the dry hollow . 
`` No , '' said Belle , `` I rather like to hear it . '' 
`` There is something awful in it , '' said Belle ; `` and then the lightning -- the whole dingle is now in a blaze . '' 
`` There are all kinds of noises above us , '' said Belle ; `` surely I heard the crashing of a tree ? '' 
You would hardly believe , Belle , that though I offered at least ten thousand lines nearly as good as those to the booksellers in London , the simpletons were so blind to their interest as to refuse purchasing them ! '' 
`` I do n't wonder at it , '' said Belle , `` especially if such dreadful expressions frequently occur as that towards the end ; -- surely that was the crash of a tree ? '' 
`` What a pity , '' said Belle , `` that the fine old oak , which you saw the peasants cutting up , gave way the other night , when scarcely a breath of air was stirring ; how much better to have fallen in a storm like this , the fiercest I remember . '' 
said Belle , `` hark ! '' 
`` No , '' said Belle , `` but I hear a voice . '' 
I was about to tell Belle that she must have been mistaken , when I heard a shout -- indistinct , it is true , owing to the noises aforesaid -- from some part of the field above the dingle . 
`` I will soon see what 's the matter , '' said I to Belle , starting up . 
As I was hesitating whether to run to the assistance of the postillion or endeavour to disengage the animals , I heard the voice of Belle exclaiming , `` See to the horses , I will look after the man . '' 
Belle , in the meantime , had raised up the man , who was much stunned by his fall ; but , presently recovering his recollection to a certain degree , he came limping to me , holding his hand to his right thigh . 
`` I will help , '' said Belle , and without loss of time laid hold of one of the traces . 
`` But we three can , '' said Belle ; `` at least , I think so ; and I know where to find two poles which will assist us . '' 
`` I care not for a little wetting , '' said Belle ; `` moreover , I have more gowns than one -- see you after the horses . '' 
In a minute or two Belle arrived with two poles , which , it seems , had long been lying , overgrown with brushwood , in a ditch or hollow behind the plantation . 
With these both she and I set to work in endeavouring to raise the fallen chaise from the ground . 
As we were descending the narrow path , Belle leading the way , and myself the last of the party , the postillion suddenly stopped short , and looked about him . 
`` Let me hear no more of this nonsense , '' said Belle ; `` if you are afraid , you can go back to your chaise -- we only seek to do you a kindness . '' 
`` You brought it on yourself , '' said Belle ; `` you suspected us , and he wished to pass a joke upon you ; he would not hurt a hair of your head , were your coach laden with gold , nor would I. '' `` Well , '' said the man , `` I was wrong -- here 's my hand to both of you , '' shaking us by the hands ; `` I 'll go with you where you please , but I thought this a strange lonesome place , though I ought not much to mind strange lonesome places , having been in plenty of such when I was a servant in Italy , without coming to any harm -- come , let us move on , for 't is a shame to keep you two in the rain . '' 
Belle in the meantime had repaired to her own place of abode . 
Belle , the postillion , and myself , sat just within the tent , by a fire of charcoal which I had kindled in the chafingpan . 
There we sat bending over it : Belle , with her long beautiful hair streaming over her magnificent shoulders ; the postillion smoking his pipe , in his shirt-sleeves and waistcoat , having flung aside his great coat , which had sustained a thorough wetting ; and I without my wagoner 's slop , of which , it being in the same plight , I had also divested myself . 
... '' `` Mind how you get on , friend , '' said Belle , in a deep serious tone . 
said I to Belle , Belle made no answer ; but , placing her elbows on her knees , buried her face in her hands . 
I demanded of Belle . 
`` I ask you once more , '' said I , addressing myself to Belle , `` what you think of the history which this good man has made for us ? '' 
`` What should I think of it , '' said Belle , still keeping her face buried in her hands , `` but that it is mere nonsense ? '' 
`` I was never at boarding-school , '' said Belle , `` unless you call . 
`` There you are right , '' said Belle , lifting up her head and looking the postillion full in the face by the light of the charcoal fire , `` for I was bred in the workhouse . '' 
... '' `` Ay , ay , '' said the postillion , `` let us hear ... '' `` Of good blood , '' continued Belle ; `` my name is Berners , Isopel Berners , though my parents were unfortunate . 
... '' `` I do n't care what the proverb says , '' said Belle ; `` I say my blood is the best -- my name is Berners , Isopel Berners -- it was my mother 's name , and is better , I am sure , than any you bear , whatever that may be ; and though you say that the descent on the father 's side is the principal thing -- and I know why you say so , '' she added with some excitement -- `` I say that descent on the mother 's side is of most account , because the mother . 
`` We do not come from Gretna Green , '' said Belle . 
`` We have never been to church , '' said Belle , `` and to prevent any more guessing on your part , it will be as well for me to tell you , friend , that I am nothing to the young man , and he , of course , nothing to me . 
`` And for my part , '' said Belle , with a sob , `` a more quiet agreeable partner in a place like this I would not wish to have ; it is true he has strange ways , and frequently puts words into my mouth very difficult to utter , but -- but . 
... '' and here she buried her face once more in her hands .
