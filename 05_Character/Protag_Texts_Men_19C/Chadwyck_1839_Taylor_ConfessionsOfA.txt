`` By all means , Meer Sahib ; we delight to see good and stout-looking fellows . 
`` Well , Meer Sahib , '' said the Nuwab to me , `` how like you this ? 
said I ; `` the works of Alla are wonderful , and assuredly these fellows are of his especial handywork . 
`` How is this , Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` I did but jest , Meer Sahib ; you know I am not one who wars with women , except when they come before me in the fair and lawful exercise of my vocation . 
`` Well , Meer Sahib , I am ready ; what is it ? '' 
`` I beg to represent , '' said Peer Khan , `` that I know both roads , but not perfectly ; still I should think what the Meer Sahib counsels the best , for the other is a sad lonely one , and few travellers go by it : as to the chance of being pursued , we must trust to our good Tukdeer -LRB- destiny -RRB- , which has brought us thus far without an accident , and Inshalla ! 
`` May your condescension increase , Meer Sahib , '' said he ; `` but putting the enam out of the question , you know very well that there is not a man among us who would not give his blood tomorrow , or any time he might be called upon , for you . 
Now , Meer Sahib , believe that a man can be killed before he touches the ground . '' 
`` It is no use speaking of him , '' said Mohun Lall ; `` the fellow is dead , and I would that all his brethren were hanging as high as he is ; but I have heard a strange piece of news since you left me , Meer Sahib , which I do not care telling you , and you may perhaps be able to give me some assistance . '' 
Zenatbee was just saying that it was that vile wretch Sukeena , come to pretend condolence , while in reality she rejoiced at our misfortune , which left her without a rival ; and I was saying -- no matter what I was saying -- when we heard a faint cry , as if of astonishment , and a bustle , and we did not know what to think ; when in rushed our lost Zora , our pearl , our diamond ; and then I thought my old heart would break with joy , for my liver seemed to be melted ; and I have done nothing since , Meer Sahib , but sit opposite to her , and stroke her face with my hands , and gaze into her eyes , to assure myself that I am not mistaken . 
Meer Sahib , if you knew how I have sat day after day , and wept till I am reduced to a mere shadow of what I was ! 
`` Ah , he is a good Syud , '' said the old woman ; `` I like to see the young fond of their devotions ; but it is ever thus with the noble race from Hindostan . '' 
Bhudrinath laughed immoderately ; but seeing the gravity of my face , he said , `` Never mind , Meer Sahib , care not for my merriment ; but truly thy face wore so lack-a-daisical an expression , that for my life I could not have refrained . 
Now , Meer Sahib , did not this bhurwa come begging and beseeching for employment , and when I said I would try him , and asked his terms , he said he was miserably poor , and would take whatever was given him ; was it not so ? 
Beat him on the mouth with a shoe ! 
spit on him ! 
may he be defiled so that Ganges ' water would not purify him ! 
may his mother , sisters , and all his female relatives be '' -- `` Nay , my good friend , '' said the Sahoukar 's clerk , `` be not thus rash and hot-headed , nor waste your breath upon so mean a wretch ; since you have employed him something must be given , it is the custom , and next time you will know better ; say , may I pay him the one per cent , which will be three hundred and six rupees ? '' 
cried my father : `` for the love of the Prophet , get me off what You can ; I swear by your head and eyes that I am a poor man , and only an agent ; is it not so , Meer Sahib ? 
`` Nay , '' said my father , `` let him have his due ; you said one hundred and fifty , -- that he shall have ; do you , Meer Sahib , go with this worthy sahoukar to his kothee , and bring the money ; I dare say he will give you a guard back , and you can hire a porter for the gold and silver . '' 
`` Meer Sahib , kind Meer Sahib , '' said the Dullal , as we approached our dwelling , `` you will forget all that has passed ; Bhugwan knows I was only jesting with you ; I love to play such tricks , -- nay , I have always been of a jesting disposition ; '' and he laughed in his terror . 
`` So , Meer Sahib , '' said he , `` you are still in the humour for a frolic ; how many lives will satisfy your worship to night ? 
`` Both , Meer Sahib , both ; but methinks you need not be so ready to ask , when we have not seen your face ever since we have been in the city . 
I must own , Meer Sahib , it was tempting ; it would even have been so for you or me , -- how much more for the Khan ! 
`` I will do so for one , Meer Sahib ; I have confidence in you in spite of your want of faith ; '' and he laughed . 
`` You have not been with us , Meer Sahib , since the Mohorum , '' said the old woman as she cracked all her fingers against her temples . 
`` I say the truth , Meer Sahib ; I swear the foolish girl 's head has been turned by your beauty ; '' and she stroked my chin caressingly . 
cried I. `` Yes , Meer Sahib ; my home is at Beeder , whither I will accompany you ; the city is no longer safe for me : my life would be forfeited were I ever to enter it again , and fall in with that prince of devils , Nusrut Ali Khan , whose house is now dishonoured , and whose beard we have spat upon . '' 
`` I had feared you would not have bound yourself by this tie , Meer Sahib , '' said she , `` and my mind sorely troubled me on the subject ; but now I am easy , and I will give my precious child to you with joy and confidence : may you be blessed in her , and see your children 's children . 
`` That is a noble weapon , Meer Sahib , '' said he ; `` may I be allowed to look at it ? '' 
`` Nay , Meer Sahib , I want it not ; but I am curious in these matters , and have a choice collection , which I will one day show you . '' 
`` And when shall you be ready to move , Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` Always , Meer Sahib ; a soldier should never be out of his harness . 
`` Meer Sahib , those rogues will never come down ; you had better give them a volley and disperse them . '' 
`` Now , my sons , '' cried I to my followers , `` whenever a fellow raises his body to fire , do you mark him . '' 
But the Nuwab is a powerful man , Meer Sahib ; you had better not risk yourself alone with him ; as for the rest , the men have secured them , -- that is , they have arranged already who are to do their business . '' 
`` He has not , Meer Sahib , that I know of , and he is as strong a man as any we have with us ; with him and another of his men you can not fail ; but let Surfuraz Khan be the Shumshea , he is a good one . '' 
`` This is an unblest country , Meer Sahib , '' said he , as we rode along . 
Meer Sahib , '' cried he ; `` what dost thou think ? 
`` You say well , Meer Sahib ; yours are good words , very good words ; and , Inshalla ! 
`` Meer Sahib , '' said he , `` the Bhutteara is faithful ; he has got news of a Sahoukar going our road , who is to leave this place in about a week ; he says we are certain of him , but that we must quit this spot , and march about within a few coss of the town , leaving two or three men with him to carry information . '' 
cried I , `` he is a worthy man ; we will listen to his advice , and be off tomorrow early . 
Three of the best runners shall stay here as he counsels to bring us the news . '' 
`` But he stipulates for a large reward in case we are successful . '' 
`` I see nothing against it , '' said I : `` he will be worthy of it if he is true to his word . '' 
`` Oh , for that you need not fear ; he is faithful so long as you pay him . '' 
`` Then he shall have it . 
How much does he want ? '' 
`` No , I do not , '' Meer Sahib . 
`` By the way I came about fourteen coss , '' said he , `` but by a path which I know the city is not more than half the distance . '' 
Accordingly , guided by him through a wild track which I should never have found alone , we reached Saugor towards evening , and after occupying our former ground , I hurried to the Bhutteara 's , where I was pretty sure of meeting my friends . 
But Oh Meer Sahib , Peroo will never come for that message ; he is too old a bird to be caught with chaff . '' 
`` Depend on it he will ; he will hear the tinkling of the silver , and will run to it as ever lover did to his mistress 's signal . 
`` As true as that I breathe : ah , Meer Sahib , have not your men seen the preparations , and will not you hear the same tomorrow from them ? 
Meer Sahib , '' was the salutation of the Sahoukar as we met at the spot whither Bhikaree had guided us . 
that is like yourself , Meer Sahib , '' said he , as I had just given utterance to a joke which caused his fat sides to shake , -- `` that is like yourself . 
Surely on some melancholy being , and you have partaken of his thoughts ever since . '' 
`` Why truly I can hardly tell you , Meer Sahib . 
The Thugs , they say , are people who feign one thing or other , till they get unwary travellers into their power , and then destroy them ; I have heard too that they have handsome women with them who pretend distress on the roads , and decoy travellers who may have soft hearts , to help them ; then they fasten on them , and they have some charm from the Shitan which enables them to keep their hold till their associates come up , despite of all the efforts of the person so ensnared to gain his liberty . 
`` True , true , '' he replied ; `` the news is welcome , for my mouth is dry , and I have not as yet washed it ; we will stop for a short time ; besides , my stomach is empty , and I have sweetmeats with me which I will share with you , Meer Sahib ; it is ill travelling without something in the inside . '' 
`` I would not exchange places with them for anything you could name , Meer Sahib , and perhaps it were well to put them out of their suspense . '' 
`` But he must be of rank , '' said Motee , `` therefore I humbly suggest that you , Meer Sahib , should undertake to see who he is , and to secure him if possible . '' 
`` Meer Sahib , '' she said at length , `` what will you think of me ? 
He pondered long ere he spoke ; at last he said , -- `` Meer Sahib , this is a difficult business indeed , and I hardly know what to advise ; go to her tomorrow ; be a man , and give not way to this boyish passion , which ill suits you ; try to persuade her that you can not do as she wishes ; speak to her kindly , yet firmly , of her home , of her relatives , and of the guilt which must cleave to you both from the connexion she proposes . 
`` For the love of Alla , '' said she , `` Meer Sahib , do something for my poor mistress ! 
`` Forsake you , Meer Sahib -- never ! '' 
What say you , Ghuffoor Khan , will the Meer Sahib serve with you ? 
I liked the Meer Sahib from the moment I saw him , and now that he is properly dressed , by Alla ! 
`` Come , '' cried the Khan to me , `` come then , Meer Sahib , take a tilting-spear from one of those fellows ; here is a rare piece of ground , and I must see whether you are master of your weapon . '' 
said he , `` thou art no stranger at this work , Meer Sahib ; thou hast played me a trick . '' 
The Rajpoot laughed , and I was glad he bore the defeat so good-humouredly , for I had expected the contrary ; he allowed that he had been vanquished , and cried out to all that it had been a fair encounter , and that he had used the utmost of his skill : `` So beware , '' he continued , `` how any of you engage the Meer Sahib ; you all know what I am , and I have been fairly beaten . '' 
cried all the men who were around me ; `` but , Meer Sahib , why not help ourselves at once ? 
`` Sit down , Meer Sahib , '' said the fattest of them , who appeared to be the chief , `` sit down ; let us talk over this matter calmly and deliberately . 
`` You have not cared for yourself , Meer Sahib , '' said Peer Khan ; `` you have taken nothing . '' 
Meer Sahib , this is rare work ; a thousand rupees in a morning 's ride is better than our own profession , though we have been lucky in our time . '' 
`` What do you think he will ask ? '' 
`` I know not , '' I answered ; `` but you had better be liberal at once , or he will sack your town , and you know what Pindharees are ; they have few scruples , and some of you may be tortured . '' 
`` Say at once , Meer Sahib , '' said another of the merchants who had not yet spoken , `` say what we should offer , and how many Pindharees are there ? 
`` I tell you all , '' said the fat sahoukar , `` the worthy Meer Sahib speaks the truth . 
`` Meer Sahib , you are a kind friend and give good advice ; without you we should not have known what to do . '' 
`` Again , '' said I , `` let none of you have long faces , but all look as if you were rejoiced at his coming . 
How is this , Meer Sahib ? '' 
Speak for us , good Meer Sahib , are you not our friend and our brother ? '' 
We have also received good counsel from your servant the Meer Sahib ; and agreeably to his instructions we have drawn up a list of a few trifles and some ready money which we are desirous of laying at the feet of your Highness . '' 
`` Put that down , Meer Sahib , '' said Cheetoo . 
`` Put down fifteen thousand rupees for the horse-shoes , this , Meer Sahib , will make the sum an even four lakhs ; and gentlemen , '' continued he to the sahoukars , `` I must trouble you to pay with as little delay as possible , or we must help ourselves . '' 
`` You see , Meer Sahib , '' said he , `` by your excellent conduct I have secured , first , seventy-five thousand rupees ; and what is over , after every proper Pindharee has got his forty rupees , will make the sum pretty near a lakh ; which is , you will say , a good beginning . '' 
`` And for yourself , Meer Sahib ? '' 
cried he , `` Meer Sahib , is that you ? 
`` You have had a watchful eye upon the times , Meer Sahib , and I expected it from you . 
The Mahrattas will then rise to a man : I will join them ; for I have been promised a high command in their armies , and territories after their conquest ; and we will rise , Meer Sahib -- yes , we , I say , for these stirring times are the fit ones for such as myself and you -- Inshalla ! 
`` Nay , interfere not , '' said the Khan , setting his teeth ; `` you and I , Meer Sahib , are friends -- let us remain so ; but we shall quarrel if I am hindered in my purpose ; and has he not said he preferred it to pure water ? '' 
`` Your words are as sweet as the wine itself , good Meer Sahib ; truly I will be with thee . 
I will tell my Saees to bring my horse and picket him among yours ; no one will see me , and I will bring no one with me . 
said he to his Saees , who was trotting after him , `` mind , you are to bring my horse and saddle to the Meer Sahib 's tent as soon as you see me going towards it . 
`` For that we are prepared , Meer Sahib ; a Thug must do his duty in any grade when occasion calls for his services . 
I tell you , Meer Sahib , that many a Pindharee has died by the hand of his fellow since we left Nemawur . '' 
`` Shame on us if we do not , Meer Sahib ; I am as strong a man as he is , and your roomal never fails . 
`` Is that you , Meer Sahib ? '' 
Meer Sahib , I have fasted all day on purpose to do justice to it ; and I should have been here an hour sooner , but I was summoned to the durbar about some trifle or other ; and I have kept you waiting . '' 
`` Now for the wine , Meer Sahib ; the pilao is dry without it , and my throat lacks moisture . '' 
Think , Meer Sahib , how we true believers will quaff in Paradise , -LRB- if what we get there will be as good , -RRB- surrounded by twenty Hooris , and each vying with the other to please us ! 
`` Ay , it is to be regretted certainly , Meer Sahib , but what there is , we must make the most of ; '' and he took another draught . 
And is it not the case , Meer Sahib , that they all sit round a table , and drink , and roar out songs , till they fall down intoxicatedThe Khan probably referred to proceedings of a very antiquated character . 
`` Then I will take employ with them , Meer Sahib ; this stuff would tempt many a better Moosulman than I am to serve an infidel . 
`` That is finished , Meer Sahib ; thou saidst thou had another ? '' 
`` I feel happy now , Meer Sahib . 
`` Nay , I care not , Meer Sahib ; though the devil came , I would pluck him by the beard : let him come . 
Ah , Meer Sahib , we were happy dogs when we were encamped in the Krishna . 
There was one charmer -- but why speak of them , Meer Sahib , -- why speak of them ? '' 
`` We shall enjoy their company the more when we get to Nemawur , '' said I. `` But here is Motee with his sitar . '' 
But the wine , Meer Sahib , pour it out for me ; thou art my Saqi , thou knowest . 
that was good ; but oh , Meer Sahib , it hath a different flavour from the last . '' 
`` It is good , and that is all I care for , Meer Sahib . 
`` More wine , Meer Sahib , ` Saqi mera ! ' 
`` About half the bottle , '' said I. `` Then give Motee a cup , Meer Sahib ; he deserves it . '' 
cried he , when he had sung a verse , `` my throat is dry ; I want more wine , I think , Meer Sahib ; but the truth is , I caught a cold some days ago , and am still hoarse . '' 
Sing , man , and I will play ; it can not spoil that , at any rate ; and the Meer Sahib hath provided an antidote for this night at least . '' 
`` It will not do , Meer Sahib , after the fatigue -LRB- a hiccup -RRB- and the trouble I have had -LRB- hiccup -RRB- all day , shouting and bullying these rascally Pindharees -LRB- hiccup -RRB- . 
How can it be expected , Meer Sahib , that I , Ghuffoor Khan , the leader of three thousand horse , should play and sing like a Goweya ? 
But these hiccups , Meer Sahib , what is to cure them ? '' 
''' `` I do not doubt it , Meer Sahib . 
`` Enough , Meer Sahib , '' said Peer Khan , who was holding his feet ; `` enough ! 
he is dead . '' 
`` What shall we do with the horse , Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` We can not take him with us , for there is not a man in the camp who does not know Ghuffoor Khan 's horse ; and we have no time to stain him . '' 
`` How , Meer Sahib ? 
`` This is a most mysterious affair , Meer Sahib , '' said he ; `` Ghuffoor Khan is gone ; and Alla or the Shitan only knows whither ! 
`` I have not , Meer Sahib , as yet ; but here they are , and I want you to help me to question them . 
Come , Meer Sahib , we must be off -- they are moving . '' 
no , Meer Sahib . 
I made a cut at the Pindharee who wounded him , but the darkness deceived me : I missed him . '' 
`` The disfigurement of my face is not all , Meer Sahib , '' said he , throwing off the dirty , ragged sheet which covered him . 
`` You of course remember , Meer Sahib , '' said he , `` that fatal night when , just as we were on the point of making off with our booty , we were attacked . 
Meer Sahib , how can I tell you that Ramdeen Singh 's was instantly recognised by the Pindharee , who vehemently demanded our blood from Cheetoo ? 
`` It was done , Meer Sahib ! 
`` May you never have occasion , Meer Sahib . '' 
`` Now we are all right , Meer Sahib . 
Ah , Meer Sahib , we shall be the brothers of owls and jackasses if he ever sees one rupee ! '' 
`` He will do nothing , Meer Sahib ; he will run from place to place , and his army may fight if they can or will : he will never draw a sword . 
I am just come from Benares , and the sahoukar who employed me has sent for more , which I am to bring down to him . '' 
`` You are fortunate , Meer Sahib , and particularly in knowing Soobhan Khan , who is a worthy man and one deservedly respected ; I have known him for many years ; he has always been a good friend to me , and has got me employment when I most required it , by becoming security for me to a large amount . 
`` Nay , there is nothing to be ashamed of , Meer Sahib ; and as for being a Pindharee , the best in the land were with him ; and a gallant army they were when the first Lubhur assembled at Nemawur . '' 
Now , however , you and I , Meer Sahib , must not separate . 
`` But I fear for you , Meer Sahib , '' said he . 
`` Compare his power and your own slight frame . 
`` His power , Khan ! '' 
`` There , '' cried the Jemadar of the Rokurreas , `` there is the moon ; when she has risen over the trees yonder we will bid you farewell , kind Meer Sahib ; we have been happy in your company , and free from alarms and danger . 
`` Ay , '' said Ganesha , who was present , `` let us go : I long to see the Meer Sahib act . 
`` Yet you are both , Meer Sahib , '' said Ganesha , with a malicious grin ; `` and your men would follow you to the death . '' 
`` Let him alone , '' said he ; `` he is a proud boy , and bickerings among us lead to no good : you must not think on what he has said . '' 
`` Oh , Meer Sahib , by your soul , by your mother 's honour , do something . 
`` Meer Sahib , '' said he , after a long silence , `` I am not what I was , -- I never shall be again ; I am broken in spirit , and am no longer fit for my profession . 
At last he said , -- `` No , no , Meer Sahib , this is folly . 
said he , `` what now , Meer Sahib ? 
`` Thanks for your kindness ; may your condescension increase , '' said he ; `` but the bunij , Meer Sahib ? 
Who is he in the tents yonder ? 
`` No , they are not Thugs , Meer Sahib , for I have tried them with the pass-word . 
`` True , Meer Sahib ; but no violence I pray ; have some consideration for my good name . 
`` But you have forgotten me , Meer Sahib : am I not to partake of your bounty ? '' 
`` How much , Meer Sahib ? 
`` By all means , '' said he ; `` anything in the jungle is acceptable ; but for your company , Meer Sahib , we should have had a dull march . 
said Ganesha to me in a voice full of alarm and apprehension : `` Meer Sahib , the Feringhees are upon us ! '' 
`` Good , '' said Ganesha ; `` but be quick , Meer Sahib , I shall be in a torment of apprehension until the whole are fairly under the ground . '' 
`` What folly is this , Meer Sahib ? '' 
Are you a fool , Meer Sahib , to risk such a chance ? '' 
`` He will never find out the difference between us and his parents , '' said I ; `` and I will not be interfered with . '' 
Now go and cry , Meer Sahib , for the loss of your plaything . '' 
`` Go , Meer Sahib , you are a boy and a fool : I do not fear you . '' 
Still I applauded his bravery , and he continued : `` Yes , Meer Sahib , these Thugs are the greatest villains unhung ; and I praise the Prophet , that I have gained some information about them , which I will give to my masters the Europeans . 
`` Never , '' said the old man ; `` never ; years have passed since then , and the lad , if he lives , is about your own age , Meer Sahib ; and -- Ya Alla ! '' 
`` It can not be , then , '' said the old man , turning away with an air of disappointment ; `` yet the resemblance is very striking , and I pray you , Meer Sahib , to pardon an old man 's mistake ; it may be that my eyes are failing me . 
`` I did , Meer Sahib , and my father will tell you that I have not overrated its efficacy . '' 
`` Nor has he , '' said the other ; `` many charms have I seen , but none equal to it : when around the neck of the wearer , no evil comes to her , no disease attacks her , and the eye of the malevolent or envious rests in vain upon her . 
`` Keep a stout heart , Meer Sahib , '' said the old man ; `` you have bought your experience with sorrow , to be sure , yet a constant attention to the wants of the holy wanderers will no doubt have its effect in the end , and their prayers will be offered for the health of your child and her long life . '' 
`` Ay , our friends of last night , I suppose , Meer Sahib . 
`` True , Meer Sahib , '' he replied ; `` but we had better put it off today . 
`` Manjeh , '' was the reply : '' 't is ready , Meer Sahib . '' 
`` Let the Meer Sahib ride on my tattoo , '' said a voice like music ; `` I am cramped and stiff , and I shall be glad to walk awhile . '' 
`` As you will , Meer Sahib , but you have only to say the word , and she dismounts . 
`` Yes , Meer Sahib , a hare . 
`` You are merry , Meer Sahib , '' cried Laloo , who I saw was at his place ; `` tell us your thoughts , that we may laugh too ; and by Alla ! 
`` Nay , Meer Sahib , this can not be , '' replied the Shekh : `` behold I am ready , I will accompany you ; my poor house is not far off , and Alla forbid I should be the means of trespassing upon your time . '' 
`` Not without the pan and utr , Meer Sahib , '' said the elder ; `` it can not be , that we should let you go like a dog . '' 
`` Is he to be bunij ? '' 
`` And they are here , Meer Sahib ; pearls from Surat and from Serendeeb , -- jewels that a monarch might be proud to wear . '' 
`` From a poor man , like you , Meer Sahib , a Syud and a soldier , I would take six thousand rupees , but from a Rajah and an infidel I would ask eight . '' 
`` Yes , father , '' said the lad , `` listen to what the brave Meer Sahib says ; and I will accompany you , and see the world beyond our town . 
`` Eight thousand rupees , you said , Meer Sahib ? 
To tell you the truth , '' continued he , `` I got them from a Pindharee , who served with Cheetoo , or Dost Mahomed , I know not which ; he kept them as long as he could , but the Lubhurs were broken up by the Feringhees -LRB- a sad blow to our free trade -RRB- , and though a few horsemen , his own followers , stuck to him , yet he had nothing to give them ; at last , when they became mutinous , and threatened his life for their pay , he was obliged to sell these , and I was the purchaser . '' 
said I. `` Yes , they were not dear , Meer Sahib ; a man in necessity rarely drives a hard bargain . 
`` Well , Meer Sahib , I have almost determined ; but it will be necessary to tell those inside , '' and he pointed with his thumb to the zenana ; `` and as you said you had to go to the kotwal on some business , if you could look in here after it is all over , about the time of evening prayer , I shall be able to give you a decisive answer . 
Much as we affect to despise women , you know , I dare say , Meer Sahib , that it makes one uncomfortable to undertake anything , more especially a journey , without consulting them . '' 
`` You are mad , Meer Sahib , '' said he ; `` this plan is not feasible . 
`` God forbid that you should say so , Meer Sahib ; but look at the matter . 
`` Seldom indeed , Meer Sahib ; but can I do aught ? '' 
said he ; `` and therefore , Meer Sahib , I pray you accompany me even now , better in disguise perhaps , and show me the house . 
`` It is my wish to go , -- my great wish , Meer Sahib ; but when I mentioned it in my zenana , though the proposition met with no opposing words or tears , they one and all declared that a lucky day must be fixed , without which it would be clearly of no use my going at all . 
You know what women are , Meer Sahib ; suffice it to say , that I could not overcome their scruples ; for the more I argued and persuaded , the more strongly they opposed ; and in fact , the matter became so serious , that to pacify them -- mind you -- to pacify them -- I sent ten rupees to a Brahmin who lives hard by , who is a noted astrologer , and the only one here in whom any confidence is placed . 
But you know , Meer Sahib , tomorrow 's conjunction of planets may have a different effect , and as you will stay '' -- `` Indeed , Shekhjee , '' said I , `` I can not stay . 
At length he said : `` Meer Sahib , you remember our agreement -- the two hundred rupees ? 
`` Impossible , Meer Sahib , '' said he despondingly . 
`` Exactly , Meer Sahib : you have hit upon the very cause . 
`` Rejoice with me , my friend , '' cried he , `` my kind Meer Sahib ! 
Ah how wise he is , Meer Sahib , and how honest ! 
-- you called him a rogue , but see , he might have kept me in suspense for a month , and refused to consult the stars at all until he had been well paid . 
Well , after all , it is the power of Alla , and doubtless these infidels hold some communion with him , which is denied to those of the true faith . '' 
`` A trifle , Meer Sahib ; a few pice to purchase oil for the temple was all he wanted . '' 
cried I ; `` truly it is grateful to the heart to see such conduct in this selfish world , where every one appears to strive how he can overreach his neighbour . 
Of course he has no prospective advantage ? '' 
`` None , Meer Sahib , none ! 
`` I will follow your advice in all things , Meer Sahib . 
`` Ah , Meer Sahib , I have had great amusement , as no doubt you have also . '' 
`` He is , he is fairly caught . 
The net is around him ; one pull and he is a lost man . 
`` Yes , Meer Sahib , even so ; I was as much astounded as you are , but the mystery was soon solved ; he proved to be a priest of our holiest of temples , Bindachul , who had travelled into these parts , and having picked up some astronomical lore at Benares , set up here for an astrologer , and found the trade so profitable that he has not returned to Bindachul . 
`` You have had the best proof , Meer Sahib ; has he not done the errand he promised ? 
And when did a Brahmin of Bindachul ever break his faith ? 
He dare not : Bhowanee would smite him on the spot , or kill him by lingering torments . '' 
`` And how , '' I asked , `` are we to convey this share to him , whatever it may turn out to be ? '' 
`` Easily enough ; we can get a hoondee on this place , and send it to him in a letter , or we can despatch a man with it . '' 
And he is right , Meer Sahib ; it would do no good . '' 
`` Put him out of his pain , '' said he ; `` the man is dying : what matters another thrust ? 
he can be buried with the rest . 
We can wrap him up in his sheet afterwards . '' 
He would have died in a short time ; I did but rid him of his misery . 
`` So he is dead ! '' 
cried the Lughaees ; `` he could not have lived long after that cut : the fellow who gave it would have done for more of us had not some of us seized on him ; but we have laid him quietly , -- he will break no more good men 's heads : and as for poor Anundee , he must be buried with the rest , for to burn him is impossible in this lonely place . '' 
exclaimed the Rajah ; `` gag him if he attempts to utter a word to influence the informer ; we will do justice in this matter ; and you , Meer Sahib , -LRB- turning to a respectable-looking person who was seated near him , -RRB- you shall be able to tell the Sahib-logue that justice can be done in the Durbar of Jhalone . 
said he in a low tone , `` how can it be , Meer Sahib ? 
`` My news is bad , Meer Sahib , and I am the unwilling messenger of tidings which will grieve your soul and add to your misery . '' 
`` You must know it sooner or later , Meer Sahib -- she is dead . '' 
`` They did , Meer Sahib . 
Alla in his mercy had taken her from her scene of suffering , almost before she knew to its full extent the horrible reality . 
When we had finished our meal , he said to me , `` Meer Sahib , you say there is no water for some coss in the direction I am going ; and therefore , if you will kindly watch my clothes and arms , I will bathe in this well . '' 
I should have starved most likely had I not killed him . 
Besides he was the first traveller I met after those good omens ; he was neither blind nor lame ; assuredly therefore he was bunij . 
It must have been his fate to die , or I should not have gone to sleep under that tree . 
Had I met him in the road , I should have hesitated to attack him ; indeed , unarmed as I was , I dared not have done so . 
`` Look you , Meer Sahib , '' said he , `` I believe I can muster as many as fifteen Thugs , in and near this place . 
`` She does , Meer Sahib ; she often speaks of you , but we have told her you are dead , and she no longer thinks of you as one whom she may ever meet again . '' 
`` Think not of the past , Meer Sahib , what happened was predestinated , and was the will of the All-powerful ! '' 
`` I will not , Meer Sahib ; she is now at play with a neighbour 's child in the zenana , and if you will follow me I will show her to you . 
`` We will not disturb them , Meer Sahib , '' said the Moola in a whisper as he pushed open the door gently ; `` look in , so that you may not be seen ; you will easily distinguish your daughter . '' 
`` I have , good Meer Sahib , '' said I , -LRB- for he was also a Syud ;-RRB- `` listen , for what I would communicate to you will be for your benefit , if you will enter into my plans . '' 
`` What would you have me do , Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` Listen then , Meer Sahib , '' said I ; `` I trust you , -- you are a Syud and I also am one ; you dare not deceive me , and incur the wrath of Alla . '' 
`` I have come , as you see , Meer Sahib , '' he said ; `` and behold , here are the files for you -- they are English , and new and sharp ; here too is the ghee . 
`` Without it you would not have seen me tonight , I can tell you , Meer Sahib . 
`` Only one , Meer Sahib ; the rest sleep soundly after midnight . '' 
`` These are new , Meer Sahib , and English . 
`` You were a fool , O Meer Sahib , for this wild attempt . 
`` Now , '' said the Darogha , `` get out if you can , Meer Sahib . 
he asked , `` so you know not of it , Meer Sahib ? 
`` He spoke the truth , Meer Sahib . 
my soul has ever told me that he knew something of me . 
I have striven in vain to bring any scene in which he was concerned with me to my recollection , and always failed . 
`` You have guessed truly , Meer Sahib . 
They were your parents , Meer Sahib . '' 
`` Well , '' continued he , `` not long after they had arrived , Ismail and Ganesha went into the bazar , dressed in their best clothes , to scrape an acquaintance with your father , and , as Ismail told us afterwards , this was effected through you ; he saw you playing in the streets , gave you some sweetmeats , and afterwards rescued you from the violence of some of the village boys who would have robbed you of them . 
Does your memory aid you now , Meer Sahib , or shall I finish the relation ? '' 
He resumed . 
`` Yes , Meer Sahib , your sister . 
But he now spoke to one bereft of sense -- of any feeling save that of choking , withering , blighting agony . 
`` Beware , Meer Sahib , '' said the Darogha , as he presented me with the money , `` beware of following your old profession ; you are old , your blood no longer flows as it used , and what you have been you should forget . 
`` You can easily overtake them , Meer Sahib , '' he said ; `` and if your old fame as a leader fails in procuring you a welcome reception , a few lines from me may aid you . '' 
`` Where is now your journey to Calcutta , O Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the other , `` the Jemadar 's day is past , and his wit deserted him when he must needs approach the den of the tiger , as if he would not be smelt out ! 
Truly we have done a good deed , '' said he to the other , `` and the Sahib-logue will be pleased with us . '' 
`` Not only , '' said he , `` do you know , Meer Sahib , that it is all true , but there are others as well as myself who can speak to these facts ; and know , moreover , that many graves have been opened , and the remains of your victims have been disinterred . '' 
`` But why should it be either , Meer Sahib ? '' 
`` I am , Meer Sahib ; `` lead on , and remember that my sword is loose in the scabbard . 
and what brings you here , Meer Sahib , so late or so early , which you please ? 
But go and rouse Ganesha , I have some work in hand for him , and have no time to lose ; it must be finished by daylight . '' 
`` Do not stand chattering there , or your share may be forgotten , Potailjee ; bring Ganesha to me , -- or tell him I am here , he will come fast enough . ''
