Her bit lassies , Kate and Effie , were better off ; for , some years before , Nanse Banks had taken up a teaching in a garret-room of a house , at the corner where John Bayne has biggit the sclate-house for his grocery-shop . 
On the Monday morning , when Charlie was to go away to meet the Irville carrier on the road , we were all up , and I walked by myself from the Manse to the clachan to bid him farewell , and I met him just coming from his mother 's door , as blithe as a bee , in his sailor 's dress , with a stick , and a bundle tied in a Barcelona silk handkerchief hanging o'er his shoulder , and his two little brothers were with him , and his sisters , Kate and Effie , looking out from the door all begreeten ; but his mother was in the house , praying to the Lord to protect her orphan , as she afterwards told me . 
Miss Girzie , whom they called Lady Skim-milk , had been in a very penurious way as a seamstress , in the Gorbals of Glasgow , while her brother was making the fortune in India , and she was a clever needle-woman -- none better , as it was said ; and she having some things to make , took Kate Malcolm to help her in the coarse work ; and Kate , being a nimble and birky thing , was so useful to the lady , and the complaining man the Major , that they invited her to stay with them at the Bread-land for the winter , where , although she was holden to her seam from morning to night , her food lightened the hand of her mother , who , for the first time since her coming into the parish , found the penny for the day 's dark more than was needed for the meal-basin ; and the tea-drinking was beginning to spread more openly , insomuch , that by the advice of the first Mrs Balwhidder , Mrs Malcolm took in tea to sell , and in this way was enabled to eke something to the small profits of her wheel . 
Charles Malcolm 's return from sea -- Kate Malcolm is taken to live with Lady Macadam -- Death of the first Mrs Balwhidder . 
When we got to the door of his mother 's house , she was sitting at the fire-side , with her three other bairns at their bread and milk , Kate being then with Lady Skimmilk at the Breadland sewing . 
In the midst of all this , Effie Malcolm had run off to the Breadland for her sister Kate , and the two lassies came flying breathless , with Miss Girzie Gilchrist , the Lady Skim-milk pursuing them like desperation , or a griffon , down the avenue ; for Kate , in her hurry , had flung down her seam , a new printed gown , that she was helping to make , and it had fallen into a boyne of milk that was ready for the creaming , by which ensued a double misfortune to Miss Girzie , the gown being not only ruined , but licking up the cream . 
For this , poor Kate was not allowed ever to set her face in the Bread-land again . 
Kate , who was really a surprising lassie for her years , was taken off her mother 's hands by the old Lady Macadam , that lived in her jointure house , which is now the Cross Keys Inn . 
Her lady ship was a woman of high-breeding , her husband having been a great general , and knighted by the King for his exploits ; but she was lame , and could not move about in her dining-room without help , so hearing from the first Mrs Balwhidder how Kate had done such an unatonable deed to Miss Girzie Gilchrist , she sent for Kate , and finding her sharp and apt , she took her to live with her as a companion . 
This was a vast advantage , for the lady was versed in all manner of accomplishments , and could read and speak French with more ease than any professor at that time would do in the College of Glasgow ; and she had learnt to sew flowers on satin , either in a nunnery abroad , or a boarding - school in England , and took pleasure in teaching Kate all she knew , and how to behave herself like a lady . 
There being a vacancy for a school-mistress , it was proposed to Mrs Malcolm , that , under her superintendance , her daughter Kate , that had been learning great artifices in needle-work so long with Lady Mac-Adam , should take up the school , and the Session undertook to make good to Kate the sum of five pounds sterling per annum , over and above what the scholars were to pay . 
But Mrs Malcolm said she had not strength herself to warsle with so many unruly brats , and that Kate , though a fine lassie , was a tempestuous spirit , and might lame some of the bairns in her passion ; and that self-same night , Lady Macadam wrote me a very complaining letter , for trying to wile away her companion ; but her ladyship was a canary-headed woman , and given to flights and tantrums , having in her youth been a great toast among the quality . 
It would , however , have saved her from a sore heart , had she never thought of keeping Kate Malcolm . 
For this year her only son , who was learning the art of war at an academy in France , came to pay her , his lady mother , a visit . 
He was a brisk and light-hearted stripling , and Kate Malcolm was budding into a very rose of beauty ; so between them a hankering began , which , for a season , was productive of great heaviness of heart to the poor old cripple lady ; indeed , she assured me herself , that all her rheumatics were nothing to the heart-ache which she suffered in the progress of this business . 
But that will be more treated of hereafter ; suffice it to say for the present , that we have thus recorded how the plan for making Kate Malcolm our school-mistress came to nought . 
Being thus destitute , it happened that Miss Sabrina heard of the vacancy in our parish , as it were , just by the cry of a passing bird , for she could not tell how ; although I judge myself that William Keckle the elder had a hand in it , as he was at the time in Glasgow ; and she wrote me a wonderful well-penned letter , bespeaking the situation , which letter came to hand on the morn following Lady Macadam 's stramash to me about Kate Malcolm , and I laid it before the Session the same day ; so that by the time her auntie 's concern was taken off her hands , she had a home and a howff among us to come to , in the which she lived upwards of thirty years in credit and respect , although some thought she had not the art of her predecessor , and was more uppish in her carriage than befitted the decorum of her vocation . 
Her 's , however , was but a harmless vanity ; and , poor woman , she needed all manner of graces to set her out , for she was made up of odds and ends , and had but one good eye , the other being blind , and just like a blue bead ; at first she plainly set her cap for Mr Loremore , but after ogling and gogling at him every Sunday in the kirk for a whole half year and more , Miss Sabrina desisted in despair . 
A toad found in the heart of a stone -- Robert Malcolm , who had been at sea , returns from a northern voyage -- Kate Malcolm 's clandestine correspondence with Lady Macadam 's son . 
It was during this visit to his lady mother , that young Laird Macadam settled the correspondence with Kate Malcolm , which , in the process of time , caused us all so much trouble ; for it was a clandestine concern , but the time is not yet ripe for me to speak of it more at large . 
The nature of Lady Macadam 's amusements -- She intercepts letters from her Son to Kate Malcolm . 
Nevertheless , with all her vagaries , she had the element of a kindly spirit , that would sometimes kythe in actions of charity , that showed symptoms of a true Christian grace , had it been properly cultivated ; but her morals had been greatly neglected in her youth , and she would waste her precious time in the long winter nights , playing at the cards with her visitors ; in the which thriftless and sinful pastime , she was at great pains to instruct Kate Malcolm , which I was grieved to understand . 
What , however , I most misliked in her ladyship , was a lightness and juvenility of behaviour , altogether unbecoming her years , for she was far past three score , having been long married without children . 
Her son , the soldier officer , came so late , that it was thought she would have been taken up as an evidence in the Douglas cause . 
She was , to be sure , crippled with the rheumatics , and no doubt the time hung heavy on her hands ; but the best friends of recreation and sport must allow , that an old woman , sitting whole hours jingling with that paralytic chattel a spinnet , was not a natural object ! 
As for the music , she was at great pains to instruct Kate , which , and the other things she taught , were sufficient , as my lady said herself , to qualify poor Kate for a duchess or a governess , in either of which capacities , her ladyship assured Mrs Malcolm , she would do honour to her instructor , meaning her own self ; but I must come to the point anent the affair . 
I went into the dining-room , where her ladyship was wont to sit ; but she was not there -- only Kate Malcolm all alone , busily picking bits of paper from the carpet . 
When she looked up , I saw that her eyes were red with weeping , and I was alarmed , and said , `` Katty , my dear , I hope there is no danger ? '' 
The flunkie had that night brought two London letters from the Irville post , and Kate Malcolm being out of the way when he came home , he took them both into her ladyship on the silver server , as was his custom ; and her ladyship , not jealousing that Kate could have a correspondence with London , thought both the letters were for herself , for they were franked , so , as it happened , she opened the one that was for Kate , and this , too , from the young laird , her own son . 
She could not believe her eyes when she saw the first words in his hand of write , and she read , and she better read , till she read all the letter , by which she came to know that Kate and her darling were trysted , and that this was not the first love-letter which had passed between them . 
She , therefore , tore it in pieces , and sent for me , and screamed for Kate ; in short , went , as it were , off at the head , and was neither to bind nor to hold on account of this intrigue , as she , in her wrath , stigmatized the innocent gallanting of poor Kate and the young laird . 
I listened in patience to all she had to say anent the discovery , and offered her the very best advice ; but she derided my judgment , and because I would not speak outright to Mr Loremore , and get him to marry Kate off hand , she bade me good night with an air , and sent for him herself . 
He , however , was on the brink of marriage with his present worthy helpmate , and declined her ladyship 's proposals , which angered her still more . 
But although there was surely a great lack of discretion in all this , and her ladyship was entirely overcome with her passion , she would not part with Kate , nor allow her to quit the house with me , but made her sup with her as usual that night , calling her sometimes a perfidious baggage , and at other times , forgetting her delirium , speaking to her as kindly as ever . 
At night , Kate as usual helped her ladyship into her bed , -LRB- this she told me with tears in her eyes next morning -RRB- and when Lady Macadam , as was her wont , bent to kiss her for good night , she suddenly recollected `` the intrigue , '' and gave Kate such a slap on the side of the head , as quite dislocated for a time the intellects of the poor young lassie . 
Next morning , Kate was solemnly advised never to write again to the laird , while the lady wrote him a letter , which , she said , would be as good as a birch to the breech of the boy . 
Nothing , therefore , for some time , indeed throughout the year , came of this matter , but her ladyship , when Mrs Balwhidder soon after called on her , said that I was a nose of wax , and that she never would speak to me again , which surely was not a polite thing to say to Mrs Balwhidder , my second wife . 
This stramash was the first time that I had interposed in the family concerns of my people , for it was against my nature to make or meddle with private actions , saving only such as , in course of nature , came before the Session ; but I was not satisfied with the principles of Lady Macadam , and I began to be weary about Kate Malcolm 's situation with her ladyship , whose ways of thinking I saw were not to be depended on , especially in those things wherein her pride and vanity were concerned . 
He was a lad of greater sobriety of nature than Charles ; douce , honest , and faithful ; and when he came home , though he brought no limes to me to make punch , like his brother , he brought a Muscovy duck to Lady Macadam , who had , as I have related , in a manner educated his sister Kate . 
The murder of Jean Glaikit -- The young Laird Macadam comes down and marries Kate Malcolm -- The ceremony performed by me , and I am commissioned to break the matter to Lady Macadam -- Her behaviour . 
Knowing how much her ladyship was averse to the notion he had of Kate Malcolm , he did not write of his coming , lest she would send Kate out of the way , but came in upon them at a late hour , as they were wasting their precious time , as was the nightly wont of my lady , with a pack of cards ; and so far was she from being pleased to see him , that no sooner did she behold his face , but like a tap of tow , she kindled upon both him and Kate , and ordered them out of her sight and house . 
The young folk had discretion : Kate went home to her mother , and the laird came to the Manse , and begged us to take him in . 
He then told me what had happened , and that having bought a Captain 's commission , he was resolved to marry Kate , and hoped I would perform the ceremony , if her mother would consent . 
So we then stepped over to Mrs Malcolm 's house , where we found that saintly woman , with Kate , and Effie , and Willie , sitting peacefully at their fire-side , preparing to read their bibles for the night . 
When we went in , and when I saw Kate , that was so lady-like there , with the decent humility of her parent 's dwelling , I could not but think she was destined for a better station ; and when I looked at the Captain , a handsome youth , I thought surely their marriage is made in Heaven ; and so I said to Mrs Malcolm , who , after a time consented , and likewise agreed that her daughter should go with the Captain to America , for her faith and trust in the goodness of Providence was great and boundless , striving , as it were , to be even with its tender mercies . 
For her ladyship had come to herself , and thinking on her own rashness in sending away Kate and the Captain in the way she had done , she was like one by herself ; all the servants were scattered out and abroad in quest of the lovers , and some of them , seeing the chaise drive from Mrs Malcolm 's door , with them in it , and me coming out , jealoused what had been done , and told their mistress outright of the marriage , which was to her like a clap of thunder ; insomuch , that she flung herself back in her settee , and was beating and drumming with her heels on the floor , like a mad woman in Bedlam , when I entered the room . 
From Yule till Pace-Monday there had been a gradual subsidance of our personal and parochial tribulations , and the spring , which , though late , set in bright and beautiful , was accompanied with the spirit of contentment , so that , excepting the great concern that we all began to take in the American rebellion , especially on account of Charles Malcolm that was in the man of war , and of Captain Macadam that had married Kate , we had throughout the better half of the year but little molestation of any sort . 
Shortly after her funeral , which was managed by a gentleman sent from her friends in Edinburgh , that I wrote to about her condition , the Major , her son , with his lady , Kate Malcolm , and two pretty bairns , came and stayed in her house for a time , and they were a great happiness to us all , both in the way of drinking tea , and sometimes taking a bit dinner , their only mother now , the worthy and pious Mrs Malcolm , being regularly of the company . 
In this year , also , Captain Malcolm , her brother , married a daughter of a Glasgow merchant , so that Mrs Malcolm , in her declining years , had the prospect of a bright setting ; but nothing could change the sober Christianity of her settled mind ; and although she was strongly invited , both by the Macadams and the Howards , to see their felicity , she ever declined the same , saying -- `` No !
