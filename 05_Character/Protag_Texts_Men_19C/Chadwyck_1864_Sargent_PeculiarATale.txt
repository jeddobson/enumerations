A white man , a Mr. Vance , whose life I had saved , wanted to buy and free me . 
I made him spend his money so it would show for more than just the freeing of one man . 
Six witnesses , whose affidavits he gives , namely , Samuel Aves , Robert Earle , John Wilkins , Dan Williams , Thomas Thornton , and William Hudson , testify to having repeatedly seen Margaret Rule lifted from her bed up near to the ceiling by an invisible force . 
They seemed to have shared the benediction of Sir William Berkeley , once Governor of Virginia , who wrote : `` I thank God there are no free schools nor printing , and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years . '' 
`` Vance of New Orleans , '' was the reply . 
`` Mr. Vance , I 'm yourn . 
Yer mus ' liquor with me , Mr. Vance . 
`` The bar is crowded just now ; let 's wait awhile , '' replied Vance . 
asked Mr. Vance . 
`` I see the North are threatening to send in armed immigrants , '' said Vance ; `` and one John Brown swears Kansas shall be free soil . '' 
asked Vance . 
`` Them niggers , Mr. Vance , air under my car ' , an ' I 'm takin ' 'em to Texas fur Kunnle Barnwell . 
inquired Vance . 
said Vance , musingly . 
asked Mr. Vance . 
The Colonel drew forth from his vest pocket a dirty card , and presented it to Mr. Vance . 
`` Shall be proud to do yer business , Mr. Vance , '' said the Colonel . 
`` I must have a talk with that handcuffed fellow of yours by and by , '' remarked Vance . 
`` Yer 'll find him a right knowin ' nigger . 
He kn read an ' write , an ' that air 's more 'n we kn say of some white folks in our part of the kintry . '' 
asked Vance . 
`` Nobody ever knowed his raal name , '' returned the Colonel ; `` an ' so we called him Gashface , seein ' as he 'd a bad gash over his left cheek . 
He was a half mulatto , with woolly hair , an ' so short-sighted he weared specs . 
Wall , that bloody cuss hahz run off more niggers nor all the abolitioners in the Northwest , -- damned ef he haint ! 
Two millions of dollars would n't pay fur all the slaves he 's helped across the line . 
He guv his hull time ter the work , an ' was crazy mad on that one pint . 
asked Vance . 
`` Let 's go and have a talk with your smart nigger , '' interrupted Vance . 
`` Wake up here , Peek , '' said Hyde , kicking him not very gently ; `` here 's my friend , Mr. Vance , come ter see yer . '' 
The slave started , and his eyes had a lurid glitter as they turned on Hyde ; but they opened with a wild and pleased surprise as they caught the quick , intelligible glance of Vance , whose right hand was pointing to an inner pocket of his coat . 
The change of expression in the slave was , however , too subtle and evanescent for any one except Vance himself to recognize it ; and he was not moved by it to take other notice of the negro than to imitate the Colonel 's example by pushing Peek with his foot , at the same time saying , `` I wish I had you on a sugar-plantation down in Louisiana , my fine fellow ! 
`` You 'll do that , will you , '' said Vance , laying both hands on the slave 's throat , shaking him , and muttering words audible to him only . 
Peek , seeming to struggle , thrust his fettered hands into the bosom of his antagonist , as if to knock him down ; but Vance pushed him up against the bulwarks of the boat , and held him there , with his grasp on his throat , till the slave begged humbly for mercy . 
Vance then let him go , and turning to Colonel Hyde , with perfect coolness , said , `` That 's the way to let a nigger know you 're master . '' 
The bar-keeper was a black man , and between him and Vance there passed a flash of intelligence . 
`` What shall it be , Mr. Vance ? '' 
The bar-keeper , with that nimbleness and dexterity which high art alone could have inspired , compounded a preparation of whiskey , lemon , and sugar with bitters , crushed ice , and a sprig of mint , and handed it to the Colonel , at the same time placing a decanter labelled `` Gin '' before Vance . 
He looked inquiringly at Vance , and the latter said , `` Go and play , Colonel ; I 'll rejoin you by and by . '' 
The Colonel winked , and answered , `` All right , '' and Vance walked away . 
`` That 's Mr. Vance of Noo Orleenz , '' replied the Colonel ; `` he 's my partik ` lar friend , an ' a perfek high-tone gemmleman , I do n't car ' whar ' the other is . '' 
As Vance reascended to the upper deck , he encountered the children at play . 
Vance caught her up , and her parents , with Mr. Onslow and Hattie , gathered round her , while the boy looked on in speechless distress . 
Then opening her eyes on Mr. Vance , who , seating himself , held her in his lap , she began to grieve in a low , subdued whimper . 
said Vance . 
he added , while the moisture began to suffuse his own eyes . 
Then , taking from his pocket a small morocco case , he said to Mrs. Berwick , `` I have some diluted arnica here , madam , the best lotion in the world for a bruise . 
And , pulling from a side pocket of his coat a fresh handkerchief of the finest linen , he wet it with the liquid , and applied it tenderly to the bruise , all the while engaging the child 's attention with prattle suited to her comprehension , and telling her what a brave good little girl she was . 
he asked . 
said Vance , thoughtfully . 
Then , gazing in the child 's face , he rejoined : `` How strange ! 
Vance picked up from the deck a little sleeve-button of gold and coral . 
`` This must belong to Miss Clara , '' said Vance , `` for it bears the initials C. A. B. '' The mother took it and fixed it in the little dimity pelisse which the child wore . 
Hattie now offered to receive Miss Clara from Vance 's arms ; but , with an utterance and gesture of remonstrance , the child signified she did not choose to be parted without a kiss ; so he bent down and kissed her , while she threw her little arms about his neck . 
Then seeing the boy , who felt like a culprit for chasing her , she called him to her and gave him absolution by the same token . 
Thanking Vance for his service , Mr. Berwick walked away with Leonora . 
`` That 's a noble boy of yours , sir , '' said Vance , addressing himself to Mr. Onslow . 
All the father 's displeasure vanished with the compliment , and he replied , `` Yes , Robert isa noble boy ; that 's the true word for him . '' 
`` I fear , '' resumed Vance , `` I gave you some cause just now to form a bad opinion of me because of my conduct to one of the waiters . '' 
Then , changing the subject , Vance remarked , `` How do you succeed in Texas in your attempt to substitute free labor for that of slaves ? '' 
`` I have heard , Mr. Onslow , '' said Vance , `` that since your removal to Texas you have liberated your slaves . '' 
`` Shall we not , '' asked Vance , `` at least grant the slaveholder the one quality he so anxiously claims , -- that which he expresses in the word chivalry ? '' 
Mr. Onslow again walked away , and then , coming close up to Vance , said in low tones : `` But retribution must come , -- as sure as God lives , retribution must come , and that speedily ! 
Vance grasped Onslow by the hand , but seemed too excited to speak . 
Then , as if half ashamed of his emotion , he said , `` Will there be men at the South , think you , to array themselves on the side of freedom , in the event of a collision ? '' 
said Vance . 
Then , lowering his tone , he remarked : `` Have you not been imprudent in confiding your views to a stranger , who could have you lynched at the next landing-place by reporting them ? '' 
Vance started at the word actor , then said , looking up at the stars : `` What a beautiful night ! 
Vance whispered a word in reply . 
Mr. Vance encountered the Berwicks once more on the hurricane deck and interchanged greetings . 
`` I fancy I see two marked traits in your little girl , already , '' said Vance to the mother , after he had saluted the child ; `` she is strong in the affections , and has a will-power that shows itself in self-control . '' 
`` Such is her individuality , '' continued Vance . 
`` I feel that I am among friends , '' said Vance . 
The party arranged themselves in chairs ; and Mr. Vance was about to take up his parable , when the figure of Colonel Delancy Hyde was seen emerging from the stairs leading from the lower deck . 
Mr. Vance , I 'm yourn , '' exclaimed the Colonel , with effusion . 
Vance took from his pocket the Colonel 's card , and read aloud the contents of it . 
`` If you 're disposed to listen to a story , Colonel , '' said Vance , `` take a chair . '' 
And he pointed to one the furthest from Mrs. Berwick . 
And Vance drew from his pocket a small visiting card crowded close with stenographic characters in manuscript . 
The Colonel reinforced himself with a plug of tobacco , and Vance began to recite what he called , for the occasion , `` The Autobiography of Gashface . '' 
The latter rose , and said , `` Sorry to go , Mr. Vance ; but the fak is , I 'm in fur a hahnd at euchre , an ' jest cum up ter see ef you 'd jine us . '' 
`` You 're too gallant a man , Colonel Delancy Hyde , '' replied Vance , `` not to agree with me , when I say , Duty to ladies first . '' 
`` Yer may bet yer pile on that , Mr. Vance ; the ladies fust ollerz ; but Madame will ` scuze me , I reckon . 
`` Business before pleasure , Colonel , '' said Vance . 
The companions having disappeared , Vance proceeded with his story . -RSB- 
In person about three inches shorter than I -LRB- and I am five feet six -RRB- , slender , lithe , and willowy , yet compactly rounded , straight , and singularly graceful in every movement ; a neck and bust that might have served Powers for a model when the Greek Slave was taking form in his brain ; a head admirably proportioned to all these symmetries ; a face rather Grecian than Roman , and which always reminded me of that portrait of Beatrice Cenci by Guido , made so familiar to us through copies and engravings ; a portrait tragic as the fate of the original in its serene yet mournful expression . 
Can it be , William , you desire it ? '' 
No , William , not for me , -- not for me the position of your wife ! '' 
Be sure , O William , tender and true , my heart will hold eternally one only image . 
I went to New Orleans , and assuming , by legislative permission , the name of William Vance , I entered into cotton speculations . 
* Should any person question the probability of the incidents in Vance 's narrative , we would refer him to the `` Letter to Thomas Carlyle '' in the Atlantic Monthly for October , 1863 . 
AT the conclusion of Vance 's narrative , Mr. Onslow rose , shook him by the hand , and walked away without making a remark . 
`` Peek freed himself , '' replied Vance . 
Greatly surprised and interested , the Berwicks followed Vance to the railing , and looked down on Peek as he reclined in the sunshine reading a newspaper . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself , '' returned Vance . 
`` Not many , I fear , either among blacks or whites , '' replied Vance . 
`` I would admit him , '' replied Vance , `` to all the civil rights of the white . 
`` To which , '' replied Vance , `` I will reply in these words of one of your Northern divines , ` What a strange reason for oppressing a race of fellow-beings , that if we restore them to their rights we shall marry them ! ' 
`` God will find a way , '' returned Vance . 
`` I deny , '' said Vance , `` that property in slaves can morally exist . 
`` I have laid my plans for taking all these negroes ashore at midnight at our next stopping-place , '' replied Vance . 
Vance placed it in a small water-proof wallet . 
The report that Mr. Vance of New Orleans was lost proves to be untrue . 
Fourteen years had made but little change in Vance . 
Just then a man on horseback , in the dress of a civilian , and followed by a slave , also mounted , rode forward nearer to where Vance sat at his window . 
Seeing the loafer stand feeling of his eye as if had been hurt , Vance said to him from the window : `` Go to the apothecary 's , and tell him to give you something to bathe it in . '' 
And Vance dropped into the hat something wrapped in a newspaper which the loafer incredulously unfolded . 
Finding in it a five-dollar gold-piece , he stared first at the money , then at Vance , and said : `` Strannger , I 'd say , God bless yer , if I did n't think , what a poor cuss like I could say would rayther harm than help . 
`` Go and attend to your eye , my friend , '' said Vance . 
An ' if ever I kun do yer a good turn , jes call on -- '' Vance could not hear the name ; but he bowed , and the loafer moved on . 
Looking in another direction , Vance saw Ratcliff dismount , throw the reins to his attendant , and disappear in a vestibule of the hotel . 
Vance rose and wildly paced the room . 
His whole frame quivered to the very tips of his fingers , which he stretched forth as if to clutch some invisible antagonist . 
He muttered incoherent words , and , smiting his brow as if to keep back thoughts that struggled too tumultuously for expression , cried : `` O that I had him here , -- here , face to face , -- weaponless , both of us ! 
Seating himself in an arm-chair , Vance calmed his vindictive thoughts . 
In memory he went back to that day when he first heard Estelle sing ; then to their first evening in Mrs. Mallet 's little house ; then to the old magnolia-tree before it . 
That house he had bought and given in keeping to Mrs. Bernard , a married granddaughter of old Leroux , the Frenchman . 
Vance took from the pocket of his vest a little circular box of rosewood . 
Unscrewing the cover , he revealed a photograph of Estelle , taken after her marriage . 
On the opposite circle was a curl of her hair of that strangely beautiful neutral tint which Vance had often admired . 
This he pressed to his lips . 
`` Dear saint , '' he murmured , `` I have not forgotten thy parting words . 
Vance shut the box , replaced it in his pocket , and cried , `` Come in ! '' 
No sooner was the door closed upon the waiter , than Vance exclaimed : `` Is it possible ? 
Peek threw off his disguises , and Vance seized him by the hand as he might have seized a returning brother . 
`` No , Mr. Vance , I 'm still a wanderer over the earth in search of them . 
`` Excuse me , Mr. Vance , I 'd rather stand . '' 
`` None that have been of much use , Mr. Vance . 
`` What do you mean , Mr. Vance ? '' 
slavery is so crafty and remorseless in working on human passions , '' sighed Vance . 
`` When you and I parted at Memphis , Mr. Vance , I went to Montreal . 
`` Yes , Mr. Vance . 
`` Are you , then , a secessionist , Mr. Vance ? '' 
`` The Colonel , '' replied Vance , `` for a time wooed fortune in Kansas , but did n't win her . 
`` I confess I 've a weakness for the Colonel , '' said Vance , `` though unquestionably he 's a great scoundrel . '' 
`` Did you ever learn , Mr. Vance , what became of that yellow girl he coveted ? '' 
`` My first endeavor , after the accident , '' said Vance , `` was to serve the man to whom I had owed my own life ; and it was not till I saw you secure from Hyde , and your scalds taken care of , I learnt from Judge Onslow that the Berwicks , husband and wife , had died from their wounds . '' 
Vance started up and paced the floor , striking both palms against his forehead . 
he exclaimed . 
`` Can you , of all men , Mr. Vance , not guess ? 
He could sell the child as a slave . 
Or , if he wanted to make her bring a little better price , he could tinge her skin just enough to give it a slight golden hue . '' 
Vance wet a towel in iced water , and pressed it on his forehead . 
`` But you pierce my heart , Peek , by the bare suggestion of such things , '' he said . 
Vance sat down , and for five minutes seemed lost in meditation . 
Then , starting up , he said : `` Where would you next go in pursuit of your wife and child ? '' 
He had no sooner gone than Vance went down-stairs to the dining-hall . 
Most of the guests had finished their dinners ; but at a small table near that at which he took his seat were a company of four , lingering over the dessert . 
Vance was just lifting a spoonful to his lips ; but he returned it to his plate as he heard the name of Onslow , and looked round . 
Yes , it was surely he ! 
On his right sat the young man addressed as Kenrick . 
At the latter Vance hardly looked , so intent was he on Onslow 's response . 
Holding up his glass , and amorously eyeing the salmon hue of the wine , he exclaimed : `` Agreed ! 
All this while Vance had been gazing on Kenrick intently , as if wrestling in thought with some inexplicable mystery . 
Vance still sat at his table , and from behind a newspaper glanced occasionally at the two young men who had so excited his interest . 
Kenrick cordially accepted the proffered apology , and then asked : `` May I speak frankly to you , Robert , -- speak as I used to in the old times at William and Mary 's ? '' 
Vance put down his newspaper , and then , immersed in meditation , slowly passed out of the dining-hall and up-stairs into his own room . 
but you havea claim , '' said Vance -LRB- for it was he -RRB- ; `` you are unhappy , and the unhappy are my brothers and my sisters . 
He knocked at the door . 
It was opened by Madame Bernard , a spruce little Frenchwoman , who had married a journeyman printer , and who felt unbounded gratitude to Vance for his gift of the rent of the little house . 
`` Is it you , Mr. Vance ? 
The gentleman 's name is Vance , is it ? '' 
`` Yes ; is he not an acquaintance ? '' 
`` I never saw him till three minutes ago . 
He noticed me resting , and , I fear , weeping in the street , and he asked me in here to rest . '' 
`` ' T was just like him . 
He 's so good , so generous ! 
He gives me the rent of this house with the pretty garden attached . 
He reserves for himself this room , which I daily dust and keep in order . 
T was a hired piano , and was returned to the owner ; but Mr. Vance found it in an old warehouse , not long ago , had it put in order , and brought here . ' 
You should hear Mr. Vance play on it . '' 
`` Does he play well ? '' 
I 've heard Thalberg , Vieuxtemps , Jael , Gottschalk ; and Mr. Vance plays better than any of them . '' 
`` Is he a professor ? '' 
But he puts a soul into the notes . 
Mrs. Bernard had opened the door that Vance might hear . 
At the conclusion he knocked and entered . 
he asked . 
`` Yes , Mrs. Bernard , '' said Vance , `` run at once to the police-station . 
exclaimed Clara , deceived by Vance 's grave acting . 
`` We will spare you this time , '' said Vance , with a smile that made his whole face luminous ; `` but should outsiders in the street hear you , they may not be so forbearing . 
Vance played some extemporized variations on the Carnival of Venice ; and Clara , who had regarded Mrs. Bernard 's praises as extravagant , now concluded they were the literal truth . 
`` Now , mademoiselle , '' said Vance , `` what can I do before I go ? '' 
Vance felt that this was the summing-up of the whole matter . 
He looked with new interest on the `` little lady . '' 
Not from her features , but from the maturity of their expression , he judged she might have reached her eighteenth year . 
Eyes -- he could not quite see their color ; but they were vivid , penetrating , earnest . 
Where had he seen a face like it ? 
After a few moments of contemplation , he said : `` Do not think me impertinently curious . 
He held out his hand , and Clara gave hers , and cast down her eyes . 
said he . 
And yet how she longed to kneel at his feet and confess all ! 
She was not quite sure how he had received her antislavery confessions . 
He might be a friend of Mr. Ratcliff . 
Vance lingered for a moment holding her hand , as if to invite her to a further confidence ; but she said nothing , and he left the room . 
Vance stopped on the stairs and listened , keeping time approvingly . 
he said . 
Then telling the little landlady not to interrupt Miss Brown 's studies , he quitted the house , walking in the direction of the hotel . 
Clara practised till she could play from memory the charming composition commended by Vance . 
`` Are you related to Mr. Vance ? '' 
He saw me in the street , weary and distressed . 
He asked me in here . 
From his looks I judged he was a man to trust . 
I gladly accepted his invitation . '' 
`` Truly he 's a friend in need , Mademoiselle . 
I saw him do another kind thing to-day . '' 
`` And was that the last you saw of Mr. Vance ? '' 
VANCE passed on through the streets , wondering what could be the mystery which had driven his new acquaintance forth into the wide world without a protector . 
Should he speak of her to Miss Tremaine ? 
But not unless he could do it without betrayal of confidence . 
There was something in Perdita that reminded him of Estelle . 
Yet he missed in Perdita that diaphanous simplicity , that uncalculating candor , which seemed to lead Estelle to unveil her whole nature before him . 
As these thoughts flitted through his mind , excluding for the moment those graver interests , involving a people 's doom , he heard the shouts of a crowd , and saw a man , pale and bloody , standing on a table under a tree , from a branch of which a rope was dangling . 
Vance comprehended the meaning of it all in an instant . 
He darted toward the spot , gliding swift , agile , and flexuous through the compacted crowd . 
Vance put a summary stop to Judge Lynch 's proceedings , breaking up the court precisely as Bernard had related . 
Here Vance saw his wound dressed , hired an extra attendant to nurse him , and then , in tones of warmest sympathy , asked the sufferer what more he could do for him . 
He had been so blinded by blood that he had not recognized Vance . 
But now , seeing him , he started , and strove to raise himself on his elbow . 
Vance and the surgeon prevented the movement . 
`` This is Mr. Vance , '' replied the surgeon . 
`` Vance ! 
Vance ! '' 
And yit I 've seen him afore somewhar . '' 
said the patient , touching Vance 's fingers carefully as he might have touched some fragile flower . 
Giving a few dollars to the surgeon for the patient 's benefit , Vance quitted the hospital . 
An hour afterwards , in his room at the St. Charles , he penned and sent this note : -- `` To Perdita : I shall not be able to see you again to-day . 
Vance meanwhile , after a frugal dinner , eliminated from luxurious viands , rang the bell , and sent his card to Miss Tremaine . 
Having heard Madame Brugière , the fashionable widow , speak of Mr. Vance as the handsomest man in New Orleans , Laura was possessed with the desire of bringing him into her circle of admirers . 
She calculated that Vance would pass there on his way to his room . 
`` Is that Mr. Vance , papa ? '' 
-- `` O , do introduce him . 
They say he 's such a superb musician . 
We must have him to try our new piano . '' 
-- `` I 'm but slightly acquainted with him . '' 
He goes into the best society , you know . '' 
`` He 's very rich , too , '' added Laura . 
`` Good evening , Mr. Vance ! 
We shall be happy to see you in our parlor , Mr. Vance . '' 
Vance bowed , and complimented the lady on a tea-rose she held in her hand . 
-- `` Never till now , '' he replied . 
You 've fairly won it , Mr. Vance ; but there 's a condition attached : you must promise to call and try my new piano . '' 
He bowed , and passed on . 
-- `` How old should you take Mr. Vance to be ? '' 
-- `` He 's too old to be caught by any chaff of yours , my dear ! '' 
A few evenings afterwards , as Laura sat lonely in her private parlor , a waiter put into her hand a card on which was simply written in pencil , `` Mr. Vance . '' 
She did not try to check the start of exultation with which she said , `` Show him in . '' 
As Vance entered , Laura said to herself , `` I know I 'm right as to his age ! '' 
During the last two lustrums of his nomadic life , he had rather reinvigorated than impaired his physical frame . 
He never counteracted the hygienic benefits of his Arab habits by vices of eating and drinking . 
Abjuring all liquids but water , sleeping often on the bare ground under the open sky , he so hardened and purified his constitution that those constantly recurring local inflammations which , under the name of `` colds '' of some sort , beset men in their ordinary lives in cities , were to him almost unknown . 
And so he was what the Creoles called bien conservé . 
That consummate ease and grace which play-goers used to admire in James Wallack were remarkable in Vance , whether in motion or in repose . 
-- `` To be sure I can , Mr. Vance ! 
-- `` I 'll do it , Mr. Vance . 
And Vance , seating himself at the instrument , exerted himself as he had rarely done to fascinate an audience . 
Vance was growing dangerous . 
And handing the cards to Vance , she asked , `` Shall I introduce them ? '' 
Kenrick drew near , and said : `` Mr. Vance , allow me the honor of taking you by the hand . 
`` Miss Tremaine reigns absolute in this room , '' rejoined Vance ; `` and from the slavery she imposes we have no desire , I presume , to be free . '' 
Thank you , Mr. Vance , for vindicating my authority . '' 
He seemed to unite with a feminine gentleness the traits that make a man popular and beloved among men ; a charming companion , sunny-tempered , amiable , social , ever finding a soul of goodness in things evil , and making even trivialities surrender enjoyments , where to other men all was barren . 
Vance rose to go . 
Vance complied with her request , singing a favorite song of Estelle 's , Reichardt 's `` Du liebes Aug ' , du lieber Stern , Du bist mir nah ' , und doch so fern ! '' 
* Then , pressing Laura 's proffered hand , and bowing , he left . 
AFTER an early breakfast the following morning , Vance proceeded to the hospital . 
The patient had been expecting him . 
`` He followed -- '' `` Sit down , Mr. Vance , please , '' interrupted the patient . 
Vance drew a chair near to the pillow and sat down . 
`` It all kum ter me last night , Mr. Vance ! 
`` My dear fellow , '' interrupted Vance , who saw the man was suffering , `` you 're fatiguing yourself too much . 
`` No , Mr. Vance . 
`` My friend , '' said Vance , `` you 've got at the truth at last , though I fear you 've been long about it . '' 
`` Yer may bet high on that , Mr. Vance ! 
interrogated Vance . 
I war n't brung up ter be very tender ` bout niggers , Mr. Vance ; but the way niggers was treated on that air plantation was too much even for my tough stomach . 
I 've seen niggers shot down dead by McTavish fur jest openin ' thar big lips to answer him when he was mad . 
There war n't ten uv his slaves out uv a hunderd , that war n't scored all up an ' down the back with marks uv the lash . '' 
inquired Vance . 
`` I did n't do nothin ' else ; but I did it slack , an ' McTavish he found it out , and begun jawin ' me . 
An ' I guv it to him back , and we hahd it thar purty steep , an ' bymeby he outs with his revolver , but I war too spry for him . 
I tripped him up , an ' he hahd ter ask pardon uv a mean white wunst in his life , an ' no mistake . 
Vance administered a spoonful , and the patient resumed his story . 
T was thar I fust saw you , Mr. Vance . '' 
exclaimed Vance , restraining his emotion . 
`` I 'm nobody else , Mr. Vance , an ' it ai n't fur nothin ' I 've got yer here to har what I 've ter tell . 
When the Pontiac blowed up , I an ' the Kunnle -LRB- he 's ` bout as much uv a kunnle as I 'm uv a bishop -RRB- , we found ou ` selves on that part uv the boat whar least damage was did . 
`` Yes , Mr. Vance , an ' it soon began ter sink . 
The Kunnle an ' I -- '' `` Stop a moment , '' said Vance ; and , drawing out paper and pencil , he made copious notes . 
`` As I war sayin ' , Mr. Vance , the Kunnle an ' I got four life-presarvin ' stools , lahshed 'em together , an ' begun ter make off for the shore . 
asked Vance . 
A drop uv water , Mr. Vance . '' 
asked Vance , giving the water . 
`` No , Mr. Vance . 
asked Vance . 
`` Yes , Mr. Vance . 
He swar 'd us both ; then writ down all we said , read it over ter us , and we put our names ter it , an ' ' t was witnessed all right . 
What bekummed of youall that time , Mr. Vance ? '' 
`` I landed on the Arkansas side , '' said Vance . 
`` Wall , Mr. Vance . 
The Kunnle swelled round consid ` rable , and got his name inter the newspapers . 
He 'd made a bad spec , ahter all . 
He 'd lost his niggers ; an ' the yuller gal , she as he hoped ter sell in Noo Orleenz fur sixteen hunderd dollars , she turned out a fool . 
Wall , Mr. Vance , uv all the mean things I ever done , the meanest was to let the Kunnle , whan we got ter Noo Orleenz , take that poor little patient thing , as I had toted all the way down from Memphis , an ' sell her ter the highest bidder . '' 
With an irrepressible groan , Vance walked to the window . 
When he returned , he looked with pity on Quattles , and said , `` Proceed ! '' 
`` Yer see , Mr. Vance , I owed the Kunnle two hunderd dollars , he 'd won from me at euchre . 
He offered ter make it squar ef I 'd give up my int ` rest in the child . 
But the Kunnle , he tried to comfort me like . 
Says he , ` The child was fairly ourn , seein ' as how we saved it from drownin ' . ' 
Vance obeyed , and drew forth a small bag of wash-leather . 
This he emptied on the coverlet , the contents being a few dimes and five-cent pieces , a tonga-bean , and a small pill-box covered with cotton-wool and tied round with twine . 
Vance opened it , and took out a pair of little sleeve-buttons , gold with a setting of coral . 
Examining them , he found on the under surface the inscription C. A. B. in diminutive characters . 
Take 'em an ' keep 'em , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` Not a rag , Mr. Vance . 
asked Vance , who , having drawn the cipher in old English , held it before the patient 's eyes . 
Vance glanced at the cover . 
Vance put the box in his pocket . 
`` Only this , '' replied Vance : `` How shall I manage Hyde ? '' 
Vance carefully recorded the mysterious words ; then asked , `` Do you remember Peek , the runaway slave Hyde had in charge ? '' 
`` In coorse I do , '' said Quattles , twisting with pain from his wound . 
`` Should you ever see that nigger , Mr. Vance , tell him that Amos Slink , St. Joseph Street , kn tell him su ` thing ' ` bout his wife . 
Amos wunst tell 'd me how he ` coyed her down from Montreal . ' 
`` Do it , Mr. Vance . 
`` Yes , Mr. Vance , I kn do without it altogether . '' 
`` One word , Mr. Vance . '' 
But I 'm not up to it , Mr. Vance . 
And kneeling at the little cot , Vance , holding a hand of the sufferer , prayed for him so tenderly , so fervently , and so searchingly withal , that the poor dying outcast wept as he had never wept before . 
Leaving the hospital , Vance stepped into an office , and drew up , in the form of a deposition , all the facts elicited from Quattles . 
His next step was to find Amos Slink . 
Vance made a liberal purchase of hospital clothing ; and then adverted to the past exploits of Amos in the `` nigger-catching '' line . 
`` Could n't do it , Mr. Vance . 
Vance not only secured the letters , but got Mr. Slink to go with him to the hospital to identify Quattles . 
Then , on his way , enlisting three friends who were good Union men , one of them being a justice of the peace , Vance led them where the wounded man lay . 
Vance then read his notes aloud to Quattles , whose competency to listen and understand was formally attested by the surgeon . 
`` He 'll not rally again , '' said the surgeon . 
Vance first went to the apothecary whose name was on the pill-box . 
Vance then proceeded to the office of L' Abeille , turned to the newspaper of that day , and there , in the advertising columns , found a sale advertised by P. Ripper & Co. , auctioneers . 
Not pausing to indulge the emotions which these cruel words awoke , Vance went in search of Ripper & Co. . 
thought Vance . 
IT being too late to take the boat for Natchez , Vance proceeded to the St. Charles . 
Entering the dining-hall , he was about taking a seat , when he saw Miss Tremaine motioning to him to occupy one vacant by her side . 
But what could he do ? 
`` I 'm so glad to see you , Mr. Vance ! 
`` I 'll do what I can , Mr. Vance . 
`` O no , Mr. Vance , I shall turn her over to you for conversion . '' 
Vance was sorry he had an engagement . 
He rose , bowed , and left . 
`` Why , '' sighed Laura , `` ca n't other gentlemen be as agreeable as this Mr. Vance ? 
He knows all about the latest fashions ; all about modes of fixing the hair ; all about music and dancing ; all about the opera and the theatre ; in short , what is there the man does n't know ? '' 
Let us follow Vance to the little house , scene of his brief , fugitive days of delight . 
He stood under the old magnolia in the tender moonlight . 
She opened it , and saw Vance . 
Tacitly accepting him as her teacher , she played it without embarrassment . 
Vance checked her here and there , and suggested a change . 
He uttered no other word of praise than to say : `` If you 'll practise six years longer four hours a day , you 'll be a player . '' 
`` No , Mr. Vance . '' 
And he played the well-known air , now appropriated by the hand-organs . 
`` Sing me something , '' he said . 
Vance went up to her . 
He could see that she was with difficulty curbing her tears . 
There was that in her attitude which reminded Vance of Estelle . 
For a moment it was as if he had thrown off the burden of twenty years , and was living over , in Clara 's presence , that ambrosial hour of first love on the very spot of its birth . 
Be wary , Vance ! 
`` Let us talk over your affairs , '' he said . 
`` No , Mr. Vance ! 
Vance reflected a moment , and then , as if a plan had occurred to him by which he could provide for her without her knowing it , he replied : `` We shall probably meet at the St. Charles . 
`` I 'll not fail to remember you in that event , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` Honor bright , Mr. Vance ! '' 
Thank you , Mr. Vance ! '' 
`` I 'll heed your caution , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` I hope so , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` Good by , Mr. Vance . '' 
Vance gave his directions to the Bernards , and then strolled home to his hotel . 
As he traversed the corridor leading to his room , he encountered Kenrick . 
Will you walk in , Mr. Vance ? '' 
`` Come up to the confessional , Mr. Vance ! 
`` You puzzle me , Mr. Vance . '' 
Vance took him by the hand and led him to a full-length looking-glass . 
asked Vance . 
`` Two rather personable fellows , '' replied Kenrick , laughing ; `` one of them ten or twelve years older than the other ; height of the two , about the same ; figures very much alike , inclining to slimness , but compact , erect , well-knit ; hands and feet small ; heads , -- I have no fault to find with the shape or size of either ; hair similar in color ; eyes , -- as near as I can see , the two pairs resemble each other , and the crow 's - feet at the corners are the same in each ; features , -- nose , -- brows -- I see why you 've brought me here , Mr. Vance ! 
asked Vance , `` for I ca n't . 
But his name was not Kenrick . '' 
Vance told his whole story , pausing occasionally to calm down the excitement which the narrative caused in his hearer . 
`` I ca n't help thinking , Charles , '' said Vance , `` that your zeal has the purer origin . 
`` Cousin , '' said Vance , `` all you lack is to join the serpent with the dove . 
`` We must not be seen together much , '' resumed Vance . 
There 's a Mr. Vance in the house , to whom I 've spoken of your singing . 
He 's wild to hear you . 
I would n't disappoint him on any account . '' 
`` Well , I mean to set my cap for Mr. Vance . '' 
He 's fine-looking , of the right age , very rich , and so altogether fascinating ! 
Clara simply thought Kenrick a very agreeable young man : handsome , but not so handsome as Onslow ; clever , but not so clever as Vance ! 
ON coming down to the breakfast-table one morning , Kenrick was delighted to encounter Vance , and asked , `` What success ? '' 
`` Cousin William , '' said Kenrick , `` I would n't take the testimony of our own humane overseer as to slavery . 
`` A favorite remark , '' said Vance , `` with our smug apologists of slavery , is , that an owner 's interests will make him treat a slave well . 
`` And yet , '' remarked Vance , `` horrible as these things are , how small a part of the wrong of slavery is in the mere physicalsuffering inflicted ! '' 
`` This war , '' resumed Vance , `` is not sectional , nor geographical , nor , in a party sense , political : it is a war of eternally antagonistic principles , -- Belial against Gabriel . '' 
asked Vance . 
Vance was the earliest of the visitors . 
On being introduced to Clara , he bowed as if they had never met before . 
Then , seating himself by Laura , he devoted himself assiduously to her entertainment . 
It was plain that Vance was deeply interested in the superficial , but showy Laura . 
As soon as she had gone , Vance rose , and , taking a seat by Clara , offered her his hand . 
`` My dear young friend , '' he said , `` tell me everything . 
That she might disclose to him her whole situation ! 
She was on the point of uttering that one name , Ratcliff , -- a sound that would have inspired Vance with the power and wisdom of an archangel to rescue her , -- when there were voices at the door , and Laura entered , followed by Onslow . 
asked Laura of Vance . 
`` It justifies all your praises , '' was the reply ; and then , seeing that Clara was not in the mood for display , he took her place at the piano , and rattled away just as Laura requested . 
Vance rose to go , and said to Laura , `` May I call on Miss Brown to-morrow with some new music ? '' 
Hardly had Clara left the hotel , before Vance called . 
He had come , fully resolved to wring from her , if possible , the secret of her trouble . 
Much to his disappointment , he learned she had gone and would not return . 
He called a second time , and saw Miss Tremaine . 
`` Only think of it , Mr. Vance , '' said the intrepid Laura , `` it turns out that Miss Brown has been having a love affair with one of her father 's clerks , a low-born Yankee . 
Vance , however , looked the narrator sharply and searchingly in the face . 
She met his glance with an expression beaming with innocence and candor . 
VANCE sat in his room at the St. Charles . 
He seemed plunged in meditation . 
His fingers were playing with a little gold cross he wore round his neck ; a trinket made very precious by the dying kiss and pious faith of Estelle . 
It recalled to him daily those memorable moments of their last earthly parting . 
And she now seemed so near to him , so truly alive to him , in all his perplexities , that he would hardly have been surprised to see her suddenly standing in immortal youth by his side . 
How could he , while thus possessed with her enchanting image , evoke from his heart any warmer sentiment than that of friendship for any other woman ? 
He thought of the so-called Perdita . 
He feared he would have to leave the city without getting any further light than Miss Tremaine had vouchsafed on the mystery that surrounded that interesting young person . 
One thing , on reconsideration , puzzled him and excited his distrust in Laura 's story . 
Perdita had pretended that the name Brown was improvised for the occasion , -- assumed while she was conversing with him . 
He had not yet heard from Peek . 
The immediate matter for consideration , however , was the danger that began to darken over Vance 's own path . 
It had been ascertained by leading Secessionists , interested in providing for the financial wants of the Rebellion , that Vance had drawn more than a hundred thousand dollars of special deposits of gold from the banks since the fall of Sumter . 
The question was now put to him by the usurpers , What had been done with that money ? 
He was summoned to appear before the authorities with an explanation . 
A committee would be in session that very evening to hear his statement . 
There was still another subject to awaken his concern . 
Vance had made preparations for the escape of Kenrick and himself . 
Everybody supposed she was a sort of spy on United States cruisers . 
For two days she had lain there with steam all up , ready to start at a moment 's warning . 
Her crew appeared to be all ashore , except the captain , mate , engineer , cook , and two stewards . 
While Vance was meditating on his arrangements , a card was brought to him . 
`` Show him in , '' said Vance to the servant . 
As Simon entered , Vance recognized him as the individual who had aided him the day of the rescue of Quattles from the mob . 
`` There 's a sort of freemasonry , Mr. Vance , '' said Winslow , `` that assures me I may trust you . 
Wary and suspicious , Vance bowed , but made no reply . 
Mr. Vance , I want your counsel , and , it may be , your aid . 
They sat down , and the old man resumed : `` I have lived in this city more than forty years , Mr. Vance , but for some time I 've foreseen that there would be little hope for a man of Northern birth unless he would consent to howl with the pack for secession and a slave confederacy . 
inquired Vance . 
interposed Vance . 
`` I know something of the man 's temper , '' said Vance . 
`` Nothing could be more opportune , '' replied Vance , `` than your coming . 
`` Yes , use your golden keys to unlock their chains in this case , '' said Vance . 
Winslow obeyed , and Vance , opening his parlor door , met Kenrick . 
`` Well , cousin , '' asked Vance , `` are you all ready ? 
exclaimed Vance , thoughtfully . 
Vance opened it , and there stood Peek . 
said Vance , grasping him by the hand , drawing him in , and closing the door . 
And then , seeing the negro 's hesitation , Vance turned to Kenrick , and said : `` Cousin , this is the man to whom you need no introduction . 
`` Now , Peek , '' said Vance , `` pull off that hot wig and those green spectacles , and , unless you would keep us standing , sit down and be at ease . 
`` None , Mr. Vance . 
Vance pointed to Kenrick , who replied : `` I know him well . 
Vance spoke first . 
`` Go on , Peek , '' he said . 
The rest grew furious , and at last made an entrance by a back door , rushed in , and overpowered William Onslow , the son , who had received a ball in his neck . 
I claimed to be a Secesh nigger , and the passes Mr. Vance had given me confirmed my story . 
You can read it , Mr. Vance . 
Peek ended his narrative , and Vance , taking the proffered letter , slowly drew it from the envelope and unfolded it . 
`` You did well , '' remarked Vance . 
He then read aloud as follows : -- `` Stricken down by a death-wound , I write this . 
`` I foresee , '' said Vance , `` that Onslow will be of our party of escape this night . '' 
`` There 's yet another service you can render , '' said Vance ; and he gave five raps on the door of his chamber . 
`` You 're among friends , '' said Vance . 
`` I hope so , '' replied Vance . 
`` You know how it is with me , Mr. Vance , '' said Peek . 
He will remain , Mr. Winslow . 
Vance sat down and leaned his head on his hands to consider if there was anything he had left undone . 
Sick at heart , Kenrick handed the card to Vance , who read it , and said : `` The sooner a disagreeable duty is discharged , the better . 
`` That reminds me that I must do the same , '' said Vance ; and , taking a large sum in bank-bills from his pocket-book , he gave it to Peek to use as he might see fit , first for the common cause , and secondly for prosecuting inquiries in regard to the kidnapped child of the Pontiac , and his own family . 
Turning to Vance and Winslow , Peek remarked : `` I thank you for your confidence , gentlemen . 
`` I wish our banks deserved it as well , '' said Vance ; then he added : `` And now , Peek , make your arrangements carefully , and be with the carriage at the door just under my window at nine o'clock precisely . '' 
Peek compared watches with Vance , promised to be punctual , and took his leave . 
Vance rang the bell , and ordered a private dinner for two . 
Unlocking a drawer , he took from it two revolvers and handed one to Winslow , with the remark , `` You are skilled in the use of the pistol , I suppose ? '' 
And Vance thrust the pistols into the side pockets of his own coat . 
`` Come , '' said Vance , `` we must eat . 
`` Here 's the dinner , '' said Vance . 
said Vance . 
Before the dinner was over , each man felt that the day had not been unprofitable , since he had earned a friend . 
And William , the brave and gentle ! 
Vance goes with us . '' 
I supposed him an ultra Secessionist . '' 
`` He has a stronger personal cause than even you to strike at slavery . '' 
Well , he shall find me no tame ally . 
VANCE 'S plan was to escape down the river in his little steam-tug , and join some one of the blockading fleet of the United States , either at Pass à l'Outre or at the Balize . 
The unexpected accession of two fellow-fugitives led him to postpone his departure from the St. Charles to nine o'clock . 
His own and Kenrick 's baggage had been providently put on board the Artful Dodger the day before . 
Winslow , in order not to jeopard any of the proceedings , had accepted Vance 's offer to get from the latter 's supply whatever articles of apparel he might need . 
At ten minutes before nine , the four fugitives met in Vance 's room . 
Vance and Onslow grasped each other by the hand . 
`` The negro who is to drive us , '' said Vance , `` is the man to whom your father confided his last messages . '' 
Vance told him he should ride on the outside with Peek . 
At nine o'clock Vance put his head out of the window . 
A rain-storm had set in , but he could see by the gas-lights the glistening top of a carriage , and he could hear the stamping of horses . 
`` All right , '' said he . 
`` You have learnt one of the first arts of the soldier , I see , '' said Vance . 
Mr. Vance and Mr. Winslow have supplied me with ten times as much as I shall require . '' 
Vance was ready for it . 
He simply twisted the lasso till Myers cried out with pain and promised to submit . 
Then pitching him on board the steam-tug , Vance left him under the guard of Kenrick and the Captain . 
Winslow followed them on board ; and Vance , turning to Peek , said : `` Now , Peek , drive for dear life , and take back your horses . 
`` Never fear for me , Mr. Vance . 
Vance saw a telegraph-pole close by , the wires of which communicated with the forts on the river below . 
Climbing to the top of it , he took from his pocket a knife , having a file on one of its blades , and in half a minute severed the wire , then tied it by a string to the pole so that the place of the disconnection might not be at once discovered . 
The next moment he cast off the hawser and leaped on board the tug . 
There was now a discussion as to Vance . 
Who knew him ? 
Had Vance contributed to the cause ? 
He had paid a thousand dollars for the relief of the suffering at the hospital . 
Did anybody know what he was worth ? 
A cotton-broker present knew of his making `` thirty thousand dollars clean '' in one operation in the winter of 1858 . 
Did he own any real estate in the city ? 
His name was not down in the published list of holders . 
If he owned any , it was probably held under some other person 's name . 
Among tax-payers he was rated at only fifty thousand dollars ; but he might have an income from property in other places , perhaps at the North , on which he ought to pay his quota in this hour of common danger . 
It was decided to send to see why Vance did not come ; and a third officer was despatched to find him . 
But let me say that Mr. Kenrick would see us all in the profoundest depths before he would put himself in our power or acknowledge our jurisdiction ; Mr. Vance can keep his own counsel and will not brook dictation , or I 'm no judge of physiognomy ; Captain Onslow has a foolish sensitiveness which leads him to resent murder and outrage when practised against his own family ; and as for old Winslow , he has n't lived seventy years not to know better than to place himself within reach of a tiger 's claws . 
Vance had abandoned his original intention of trying the Pass à l'Outre . 
Having learned from a pilot that the Brooklyn , carrying the Stars and Stripes , was cruising off the Southwest Pass , he resolved to steer in that direction . 
Vance ordered the Stars and Stripes to be run up , and the engines to be reversed . 
Vance saw his opportunity , and , with the quickness of one accustomed to dead-shots , decided on his range . 
Vance fired a second shot , but this time over her , as a summons for surrender . 
Vance went on board , found in the Commodore an old acquaintance , and after recounting the adventures of the last twelve hours , gave up the two steamers for government use . 
It was then arranged that he and his companions should take passage on board the store-ship Catawba , which was to sail for New York within the hour ; while all the persons captured on board the Rebel , together with the detective carried off by Vance , should be detained as prisoners and sent North in an armed steamer , to leave the next day . 
`` There 's one man , '' said Vance , -- `` his name is Ratcliff , -- who will try by all possible arts and pleadings to get away . 
`` I 'll take your word for it , Vance , that he is n't to be trusted . '' 
`` More , Mr. Vance , more ! 
Vance and the Commodore shook hands and parted . 
Vance was rowed back to the Artful Dodger . 
On his way , looking through his opera-glass , he could see Ratcliff in the cutter , gnawing his rage , and looking the incarnation of chagrin . 
The Catawba was making her toilet ready for a start . 
She lay at a short distance from the Artful . 
Vance , Winslow , Kenrick , and Onslow went on board , where the orders of the Commodore had secured for them excellent accommodations . 
This man was he who has passed so long in this story under the adopted name of Vance . 
`` Make this allowance for me , Mr. Vance : I have many conflicting interests to reconcile ; many conflicting facts and assertions to sift and weigh . 
`` I think not , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` But are you a prophet , Mr. Vance ? '' 
`` A great man , '' said Vance , `` ought to lead and fashion public opinion in stupendous emergencies like this , -- ought to throw himself boldly on some great principle having its root in eternal justice , -- ought to grapple it , cling to it , stake everything upon it , and make everything give way to it . '' 
`` But I am not a great man , Mr. Vance , '' said the President , with unaffected naïveté . 
asked Vance . 
`` Mr. Vance , you eager philanthropists little know how hard it often is for less impulsive and more conservative men to withstand the urgency of those feelings that you give way to at once . 
exclaimed Vance , `` I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot . 
* `` Well , Mr. Vance , we will suppose the Mississippi opened ; New Orleans , Mobile , Charleston , and Richmond captured , -- the Rebellion on its last legs ; -- what then ? '' 
`` With the capture of New Orleans and Vicksburg , and the opening of the Mississippi , you have Secessia on the hip , and her utter subjugation is merely a question of time . 
When she cries peccavi , and offers to give in , I would say to the people of the Rebel States : ` First , Slavery , the cause of this war , must be surrendered , to be disposed of at the discretion of the victors . 
`` But you say nothing of confiscation , '' Mr. Vance . 
`` Undoubtedly , Mr. Vance , the interests of the masses , North and South , are identical . '' 
`` When the mass of the people at the South , '' continued Vance , `` come to see , as they will eventually , that we have been fighting the great battle of humanity and of freedom , for the South even more than for the North , for the white man even more than for the black , there will be such a reaction as will obliterate every trace of rancor that internecine war has begotten . 
Vance rose to take his leave . 
`` Mr. President , '' said he , `` I thank you for this interview But there 's one thing in which you 've disappointed me . '' 
Sit down , Mr. Vance , and let me make up for my remissness . '' 
Vance resumed his seat . 
asked Vance . 
Vance pressed it with a respectful cordiality , and withdrew from the White House . 
There was a knock at the door , and Vance entered . 
he asked cheerily . 
`` Better and better , my dear Mr. Vance . '' 
`` Let me feel of his pulse . 
He ate two boiled eggs and a lamb chop for breakfast , not to speak of a slice of aerated bread . '' 
He will be ready soon for a bullet through his other lung . 
But he must not get restless . 
There 's plenty of fighting in store for him . '' 
`` Mr. Vance , I 've been pondering the strange story of your life ; your interview with my father on board the Pontiac ; the loss of the Berwicks ; the supposed loss of their child ; the developments by which you were led to suspect that the child was kidnapped ; Peek 's unavailing search for the rascal Hyde ; the interview with Quattles , confirming your suspicion of foul play ; and finally your interview last week in New York with the mulatto woman , Hattie Davy . 
Vance took from his pocket a small circular box which he unscrewed , and there , in the centre of a circle of hair , lay the button . 
He handed the box to the wounded soldier . 
exclaimed Vance . 
said Vance . 
`` Again I say , impossible , '' quoth Vance . 
Suddenly the Lieutenant noticed the little sleeve-button in Onslow 's hand , and , while the blood mounted to his forehead , turning to him said , `` How did you come by this , Robert ? '' 
inquired Vance . 
`` Now I know you 're raving , '' said Vance ; `` for , till now , it has n't been out of my pocket since Quattles gave it me . '' 
Startling as a severe blow was this declaration to Vance . 
It forced upon his consideration a possibility so new , so strange , so distressing , that he felt crushed by the thought that there was even a chance of its truth . 
Such an opportunity , thrust , as it were , by Fate under his eyes , had it been allowed to escape him ? 
His emotions were those of a blind man , who being suddenly restored to sight , learns that he has passed by a treasure which another has picked up . 
He paced the room . 
He struck his arms out wildly . 
He pushed up the sleeves of his coat with an objectless energy , and then pulled them down . 
he groaned , `` too intent on thy own little burrow to see the stars out-shining ! 
And then , as if ashamed of his ranting , he sat down and said : `` How strange that this possibility should never have occurred to me ! 
said Vance . 
exclaimed Vance , fiercely , arresting Kenrick 's hand so he could not examine the button . 
ejaculated Vance , releasing him , and sinking into an arm-chair . 
And then , after several seconds of profound sighing , he drew forth from his pocket-book an envelope , and said : `` This contains the testimony of Hattie Davy in regard to certain personal marks that would go far to prove identity . 
`` Tell me , Captain , '' said Vance to Onslow , `` did you ever notice in Perdita any physical peculiarity , in which she differed from most other persons ? '' 
interrupted Vance . 
exclaimed Vance , dashing one hand against the other . 
Vance took from the envelope a paper , and unfolding it pointed to these lines which Onslow and Kenrick perused together : -- `` You tell me one of her eyes was dark blue , the other dark gray . 
`` Do you remember , Charles , '' said Vance , `` our visit to the hospital the day after our landing in New York ? '' 
`` Do you remember , '' continued Vance , `` among the nurses quite a young girl , who , while carrying a salver of food to a wounded soldier , was asked by you if you should not relieve her of the burden ? '' 
`` It will be very difficult to do that , I fear , '' said Vance , `` even supposing we can find and identify the true heir . '' 
Then putting it down , and turning to Vance , he said , with a sweet sincerity in his tone : `` Cousin , where my wishes are so strongly enlisted , you can judge better than I of my duty . 
`` Truly I think your place is here , '' said Vance . 
It was for Vance . 
He opened it , and finding it was from Peek , read as follows : -- `` Dear Mr. Vance : On leaving you at the Levee I drove straight for the stable where my horses belonged . 
Two days after your departure the newspapers contained flaming accounts of the treacherous seizure of the Artful Dodger by Messrs. Vance , Winslow , & Co. , -- their pursuit by the Rebel , the encounter , the Rebel 's discomfiture , the ` abduction ' of Mr. Ratcliff , the funeral of his poor wife , etc. . 
Here there was a cry of pain from Vance , so sharp and sudden that Kenrick started forward to his relief . 
`` I 'll finish reading the letter by myself , '' replied Vance , taking his departure without ceremony . 
Seated in his own apartment , he continued the reading : -- `` Do not think me fanciful , Mr. Vance , but the moment I set eyes on this young woman the conviction struck me , She is the lost Clara for whom we are seeking . 
Clara was much moved when she learnt that the same Mr. Vance , whose acquaintance she had made , was the one who had known the parents , and was now seeking for their daughter . 
Mr. Vance , I thought of Naomi , and wondered if she would be living to share the promised fortune . 
We have seen with what profound emotion Vance received the information , that the man whose formidable power was enclosing Clara in its folds was the same whose brutality had killed Estelle . 
Vance could no longer doubt that Clara and Perdita were identical . 
He looked in his memorandum-book to assure himself of the name of Clara 's father . 
Then putting on his hat Vance hurried to the War Office . 
Vance looked at his watch , and then passed out into the paved corridor and walked up and down . 
He thought of Clara , -- of the bracelet of his wife 's hair on her wrist . 
It moved him to tears . 
Was there not something in the identity in the position of these two young and lovely women that seemed to draw him by the subtle meshes of an overruling fate to Clara 's side ? 
Vance took the words into his believing heart , and thenceforth they were a reality from the sense of which he could not withdraw himself , and would not have withdrawn himself if he could . 
He looked again at his watch , and re-entered that inner office of the War Department , to which none but those high in government confidence were often admitted . 
Suddenly she remembered it was that fearful `` John Brown Hallelujah Chorus , '' which Vance had played and sung for her the first evening of their acquaintance . 
It was that of Vance . 
He lifted her flaccid form from the posture in which she had thrown herself , -- lifted and supported it against his breast as if to give her the full assurance of safety and protection . 
She opened her eyes upon him as thus they stood , -- eyes now beaming with reverential gratitude and transport . 
He looked at them closely . 
`` Yes , '' said he , `` there they are ! 
Clara instinctively threw an arm over Vance 's shoulder . 
But Vance was too swift for him . 
Placing Clara in a chair , quick as the tiger-cat springs on his prey , he darted upon Ratcliff , and before the latter could pass out on to the landing , relocked the door and took the key . 
`` Now look at me well , '' said Vance . 
Vance stood with a look like that of St. George spearing the dragon . 
The past , with all its horrors , surged up on his recollection . 
He thought of that day of Estelle 's abduction , -- of the escape and recapture , -- of that scene at the whipping-post , -- of the celestial smile she bent on him through her agony , -- of the scourging he himself underwent , the scars of which he yet bore , -- of those dreadful hours when he clung to the loosened raft in the river , -- of the death-scene , the euthanasia of Estelle , of his own despair and madness . 
And here , before him , within his grasp , was the author of all these barbarities and indignities ! 
Vance carried in a secret pocket a pistol , and wore a small sword at his side . 
Vance looked inquiringly about the room . 
Vance , with the easy knack of an adroit wrestler , threw him on the floor , then dragging him toward the closet , pulled from a nail a thick leather strap which hung there , having been detached from a trunk . 
Suddenly , in the midst of these inflictions , Vance felt his arm arrested by a firm grasp . 
He disengaged himself with a start that was feline in its instant evasiveness , turned , and before him stood Peek , interposing between him and the prostrate Ratcliff . 
`` Stand aside , Peek , '' said Vance ; `` I have hardly begun yet . 
`` Not one more blow , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` No , Mr. Vance , I 'll not think so poorly of you as to believe you 've done any such thing . 
`` Have I ever done that which entitles me to ask a favor of you , Mr. Vance ? '' 
Vance recoiled for a moment , then replied : `` You have used the last appeal ; but ' t will not serve . 
`` You shallnot give him another blow , '' said Peek . 
Then , in a moment , Vance seemed to regret the act . 
He jumped forward , helped the negro up , begged his pardon , saying : `` Forgive me , my dear , dear Peek ! 
And the tears sprang to Vance 's eyes . 
`` No harm done , Mr. Vance ! 
And Peek turned on him such an expression , at once tender and benignant , that Vance , seeing they understood each other , was reassured . 
-- standing on the upper deck of one of the smaller steamers , and almost one of the first persons he saw , was Mr. Vance . 
Peek shouted his name , and Vance , leaping on shore , threw his arms impulsively round the brawny negro , and pressed him to his breast . 
In a few clear words , Peek made Vance comprehend the precise state of affairs , and in five minutes the latter , at the head of a couple of hundred soldiers , and with Peek walking at his side , was on his way to the jail . 
Vance turned to an orderly , and said , `` Arrest this man . '' 
`` Now , sir , '' said Vance , cocking his pistol and taking out his watch , `` Produce Antoine Lafour in five minutes , or I will shoot you dead . '' 
`` Yes , Antoine , and this is Mr. Vance , and here 's the old flag , and you 're no longer a slave . '' 
Peek checked him , and bade him remember the company he was in ; and Antoine bowed to Vance and said : `` ` Scuze me , Kunnle . 
Peek smiled significantly at Vance , and the latter , approaching the deputy who had not yet been released from custody , remarked : `` You have a man named Hyde confined there . '' 
Ignorant of the great event of the day , not perceiving the old flag , and supposing that he had been called out to be shot , Hyde walked up to Vance , and said : `` Kunnle , you look like a high-tone gemmleman , and afore I 'm shot I want ter make a confidential request . '' 
said Vance , shading his face with his cap so as not to be recognized . 
Wall , ter come ter the pint : I want you ter write a letter ter Dorothy , jes tellin ' her that the reason why Delancy ca n't remit is that Delancy has been shot ; and tellin ' her he sent his love and all that -- whar you ca n't come it too strong , Kunnle , for yer see Dorothy an ' I , we was ` bout the same age , and used ter make mud-pies together , and sail our boats together down thar in the old duck-pond , when we was childern ; an ' so yer see -- '' Vance looked into his face . 
Yes , the battered old reprobate was trying to gulp down his agitation , and there were tears rolling down his cheeks . 
Vance was touched . 
he said . 
Mr. Vance ? 
Mr. Vance ! '' 
`` Wall , how in creation -- '' `` It 's all right , Hyde , '' interrupted Vance . 
Awestruck and stunned , he stared stupidly , first at Vance , then at the flag , and finally at Peek . 
The roll of the drum , accompanied by Vance 's orders to the soldiers , roused him , and then attaching himself to Peek , he marched on with the rest , Peek beguiling the way with much useful and enlightening information . 
They had not marched farther than the next carriage-stand when Vance , leaving Captain Onslow in command , with orders to bivouac in Canal Street , slipped out of the ranks , and beckoning to Peek and his companions , they all , including Antoine and Hyde , entered a vehicle which drove off with the faithful Victor running at its side . 
Behold them now in Vance 's old room at the St. Charles . 
During the interval of waiting for Victor 's return , `` Tell me now , Peek , '' said Vance , `` of your own affairs . 
`` I must make the acquaintance of that Charlton , '' said Vance . 
`` Those letters we must have , Hyde , '' said Vance . 
`` Well , Hyde , go into the next room and write a letter to your nephew , telling him to start at once for New York city , and report himself to Mr. William C. Vance , Astor House . 
I 'll give you a couple of hundred dollars to enclose for him to pay his expenses , and a couple of hundred more for your sister . '' 
Colonel Hyde moved with alacrity to comply with Vance 's bidding . 
Mr. Winslow and Captain Onslow now entered , followed by Colonel Blake , between whom and Vance a friendship had sprung up during the voyage from New York . 
cried Vance . 
`` Captain Onslow , '' said Vance , `` arrest the man at once . '' 
`` Sit down , Mr. Semmes , '' said Vance ; `` I have a few questions to put to you . 
Happily for Semmes , before he could perjure himself irretrievably , there was a knock at the door , and Antoine entered , followed by the bloodhound , bearing something tied in a white handkerchief , in his mouth . 
Darting forward , just as Vance received from Antoine the little bundle the dog had been carrying , the lawyer exclaimed : `` Colonel Vance , I do not know , but I can conjecturewhere the girl is . 
Vance paused , and looked the old lawyer straight in the eyes till the latter withdrew his glance , and resorted to his snuff-box to cover his discomfiture . 
Deep as he was , he saw that he had been fathomed . 
But Vance bowed politely , and said : `` We will see , sir , if your information agrees with that of the dog . '' 
He untied the handkerchief , took out the paper-weight , and underneath it found Clara 's note , which he opened and read . 
None but Semmes and Peek noticed the slightly sarcastic stress which Vance put on this last word from his lips . 
Vance now knelt on one knee , and resting on the other the fore-legs of the bloodhound , patted his head and praised him in a manner which Victor , by his low , gratified whine , seemed fully to comprehend and appreciate . 
Peek , who had been restless ever since the words `` 21 Camelia Place '' had fallen on his ears , here said : `` Lend me your revolver , Mr. Vance , and do n't leave till I come back . 
`` I will trust you with the preliminary reconnoissance , Peek , '' said Vance , giving up the weapon . 
Mr. Semmes , now realizing that by some display of zeal , even if it were superserviceable , he might get rid of the ill odor which would follow from lending himself to Ratcliff 's schemes , approached Vance and said : `` Colonel , it was only quite recently that I heard of the suspicions that were entertained of foul play in the case of that little girl claimed by Ratcliff as a slave . 
`` I like your suggestion , Mr. Semmes , '' said Vance , in a tone which quite reassured the lawyer ; `` go on and make all the investigations in your power bearing on this case . 
In his rapid and penetrating judgments of men , Vance rarely went astray ; and when Semmes , who was thinking of a little private business of his own with the President of the Lafayette Bank , remarked , `` If you can dismiss me now , Colonel , I will meet you an hour hence at any place you name , '' Vance knew the old lawyer would keep his promise , and replied : `` Certainly , Mr. Semmes . 
It was arranged that Antoine and Sam , well armed , and supported by the bloodhound , should remain and look after Ratcliff , not precipitating action , however , and not communicating with Clara , whose relief Peek had generously resolved should first come from the hands of Vance . 
Here he told Vance all he had done , and introduced the two women , -- Vance greeting Esha with much emotion , as he recognized in her that attendant at his wife 's death-bed for whom he had often sought . 
Into one stepped Winslow , Hyde , and Vance ; into another Semmes , Blake , Onslow , and Blake 's trusty servant , Sergeant Decazes , the escaped slave . 
Vance darted up to the room where Clara 's note had instructed him he could find her . 
Seeing the key on the outside , he turned it , opened the door , and presented himself to Clara in the manner already related . 
As Vance left the house , with Clara on his arm , several of Ratcliff 's slaves gathered round them . 
To all these Vance promised immediate freedom and help . 
`` Vance ! '' 
Vance had donned his citizen 's dress . 
He wore a blue frock , fastened by a single black silk button at the top , a buff vest , white pantaloons , and summer shoes . 
Without a shoulder-strap , he looked at once the soldier and the gentleman . 
Rapidly and keenly he took Charlton 's physiognomical measure , then glanced at Pompilard . 
inquired Vance . 
`` Now , Mr. Charlton , '' said Vance , `` what I have to say is , that I am called Colonel Vance ; that I am recently from New Orleans ; that while there it became a part of my official duty to look at certain property held in your name , but claimed by another party . '' 
`` Claimed by a rebel and a traitor , Colonel Vance . 
`` I shall be obliged to you for the interview , Colonel Vance . '' 
`` Thank you for the suggestion , Colonel Vance . 
`` That would suit me precisely , Colonel Vance . '' 
Charlton put out his hand , but Vance bowed without seeming to notice it , and passed out of the house into the carriage . 
`` Mr. Pompilard , '' said he , as the carriage moved on , `` are you willing to take me on trust , say for the next hour , as a gentleman , and comply with my reasonable requests without compelling me to explain myself further ? 
Call me , if you please , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` Truly , Mr. Vance , '' replied Pompilard , `` I do not see how I risk much in acceding to your proposition . 
Yes , I willtrust you , Mr. Vance . '' 
`` That we can do , Mr. Vance . 
Vance looked at it . 
`` I must n't be outdone , '' said he , `` by a lady . 
As the carriage crossed the Bowery and bowled into Lavinia Street , Pompilard remarked : `` There are some advantages , Mr. Vance , in being on the East River side . 
`` A modest little place we have taken for the summer , Mr. Vance . 
`` Take a seat , Mr. Vance . 
Instantly a great tumult was heard in the room over Vance 's head . 
It was the first money his literary efforts had ever brought him . 
Thenceforth the thousands would pour in upon him in an uninterrupted flood . 
Vance was of course introduced to all the inmates , and made a partaker in their good spirits . 
Vance handed them into the carriage . 
He and Pompilard took the back seat . 
`` Mrs. Pompilard , '' said Vance , `` we are on our way to the Astor House , where I propose to introduce to you a young lady . 
Vance and his party had now been several days in New York , occupying contiguous suites of rooms at the Astor House . 
Never had Vance showed his influence in so marked a degree as in the change he had wrought in Hyde . 
Detecting in the rascal 's affection for a widowed sister the one available spot in his character , Vance , like a great moral engineer , had mounted on that vantage-ground the guns which were to batter down the citadels of ignorance , profligacy , and pride , in which all the regenerative capabilities of Hyde 's nature had been imprisoned so long . 
The idea of having that poor toiling sister -- her who had `` fust taught him to make dirt-pies , down thar by the old duck-pond '' -- rescued with her children from poverty and suffering , placed in a situation of comfort and respectability , was so overpowering to the Colonel , that it enabled Vance to lead him like a child even to the abjuring of strong drink and profanity . 
Cut off from bragging of his Virginia birth and his descent from the Cavaliers , -- made to see the false and senseless nature of the slang which he had been taught to expectorate against the `` Yankees , '' -- Hyde might have lost his identity in the mental metamorphosis he was undergoing , were it not that a most timely substitute presented itself as a subject for the expenditure of his surplus gas . 
Vance had collected and arranged a body of proofs for the establishment of Clara 's identification as the daughter of Henry Berwick ; but , if Colonel Hyde 's memory did not mislead him , there was collateral evidence of the highest importance in those old letters from Charlton , which might be found in a certain trunk in the keeping of the Widow Rusk in Alabama . 
A boy , travel-soiled and dusty , apparently fifteen years old , dressed in a butternut-colored suit , wearing a small military cap marked C. S. A. , and bearing a knapsack on his back , suddenly accosted Colonel Hyde with the inquiry , `` Does Mr. William C. Vance live here ? '' 
We have spoken of the influence which Vance had applied to this stony nature . 
Having given him his first lesson in morals and politics , Colonel Hyde made him wash his face , and then took him down-stairs and introduced him to Vance . 
Turning to Delancy junior , Vance , who had opened all the windows when the youth came in , questioned him as to his adventures on his journey . 
It was a proud day for the elated Hyde when Vance said : `` That nephew of yours shall be rewarded . 
A dinner at Vance 's private table , with ladies and gentlemen present , put the apex to the splendid excitements of the day in the minds of both uncle and nephew . 
Some hours previously , Vance had introduced Clara to her nearest relatives , the Pompilards ; but before telling them her true name he had asked them to trace a resemblance . 
Vance then briefly presented his proofs of the relationship . 
asked Mr. Semmes of Vance . 
Hyde drew near to Vance , and the latter threw open the door . 
After saluting Vance , Charlton started on recognizing the gaunt figure of Delancy Hyde . 
Vance took soundings of Charlton 's character , and found that rumor , for once , had not been unjust in her disparagement . 
Suddenly Vance went to the piano , and , striking some of the loud keys , attracted the attention of the company , and then begged them to be silent while he made a few remarks . 
`` We are assembled , ladies and gentlemen , '' he said , `` on business in which Mr. Charlton here present is deeply interested . '' 
`` If , '' continued Vance , `` I have not communicated privately to Mr. Charlton , or his respectable counsel , all the startling and important facts bearing on the case , I hope they will understand that it was not through any failure of respect for them , and especially for Mrs. and Miss Charlton , but simply because I have thought it right to choose the course which seemed to me the most proper in serving the cause of justice and of the party whose interests I represent . '' 
`` No innocent man , '' continued Vance , `` will think it ever untimely to be told that he is holding what does not belong to him ; that he has it in his power to rectify a great wrong ; to make just restitution . 
`` No , ladies and gentleman , '' said Vance , crossing the room , taking Clara by the hand , and leading her forth , `` what I have to show is , that she did n't die at all , and that Clara Aylesford Berwick now stands before you . '' 
His features were ghastly in their expression of mingled amazement and featnres , coupled with a horrible misgiving of the truth of the disclosure , to which Vance 's assured manner and the affirmative presence of Colonel Hyde gave their dreadful support . 
`` Sir , '' replied Vance , `` you entirely misapprehend my object . 
`` There will be time , '' continued Vance , `` for the scrutiny of the law hereafter . 
Moved by that same infatuation which compels a giddy man to look over the precipice which is luring him to jump , Charlton , with a deplorable affectation of composure , wiped the perspiration from his brow , and said : `` Well , sir , bring on these proofs that you pretend are so irresistible . 
`` First , '' said Vance , `` I produce the confession of Hyde , here present , and of Quattles , deceased , that the infant child of Mr. Berwick was saved by them from the wreck of the Pontiac , taken to New Orleans , and sold at auction as a slave . 
`` Even on this point , sir , '' replied Vance , `` we are not weak . 
As Vance spoke , he held one of the letters so that Charlton could read it . 
Mrs. Charlton approached Vance , and said , `` Will you allow me to examine those letters ? '' 
`` Certainly , madam , '' he replied . 
She took them one by one , scrutinized the handwriting , read them carefully , and returned them to Vance . 
Void as her heart was of affection for her husband , something like pity crept in as she recalled his look of anguish and alarm at Vance 's disclosures . 
What cheer could she give unless she went with a lie , telling him that Vance 's startling revelation was all a trick ! 
And thus finally did Vance carry his point , and establish the rights of the orphan of the Pontiac . 
It was on a warm , pleasant day in the last week of September , 1862 , that he called to take leave of her . 
Little more than an hour 's drive beyond the Central Park brought him to a private avenue , at the stately gate of which he found children playing . 
One of these was a cripple , who , as he darted round on his little crutch , chasing or being chased , seemed the embodiment of Joy exercising under difficulties . 
His name was Andrew Rusk . 
Vance , recognizing Esha , asked if Clara was at home . 
While Vance is waiting in a large and lofty drawing-room for her appearance , let us review some of the incidents that have transpired since we encountered her last . 
At their parting interview Vance ingenuously told him he considered him a scoundrel . 
Semmes did n't see it in that light , and entered into a long argument to prove that he had done no wrong . 
Vance listened patiently , and said in reply , `` Do you perceive an ill odor of dead rats in the wall ? '' 
`` I do , '' said Vance ; `` good by , sir ! '' 
But it is in the track of Vance and Clara that we promised to conduct the reader . 
Never had she appeared so radiant in Vance 's eyes . 
And then the pleasure of seeing Vance showed itself so unreservedly in her face ! 
They strolled through the well-appointed garden , and Vance was glad to see that Clara had a genuine love of flowers and fruits , and could name all the varieties , distinguishing with quick perception the slightest differences of form and hue . 
`` Well , Clara , '' said Vance , `` I have heard to-day great and inspiring news . 
cried Clara , giving him her hand for a grasp of congratulation . 
`` But I foresee , '' said Vance , `` that there is much yet to be done before it can be effective , and I 've come to bid you a long , perhaps a last farewell . '' 
Vance sat wondering at her disappearance . 
He rose to seek her , when suddenly he saw her climbing leisurely up the bank , a few wild-flowers in her hand . 
`` Thank you , '' said Vance , not wholly deceived by her calm , assured manner . 
she said , smiling and looking him full in the face . 
`` And is there nothing I can do , Mr. Vance , to let you see I have some little gratitude for all that you have done for me ? '' 
`` That we can not fail to do , '' said Vance . 
`` I 'm a poor correspondent , '' replied Vance ; `` but I shall obey . 
Vance took leave of all the inmates , not forgetting Esha . 
He went to Hyde 's cottage , and had an affectionate parting with that worthy ; and then drove to a curve in the road where Clara stood waiting solitary to exchange the final farewell . 
Vance dismounted from his carriage and drew near . 
Vance felt that he was treading on enchanted ground , and that the atmosphere swam with the rose-hues of young romance . 
Rather high up on the wrist of the right was a bracelet ; a bracelet of that soft , fine hair familiar to Vance . 
He recognized it now , and the tears threatened to overflow . 
Lifting the wrist to his lips he kissed it , and then , with a `` God keep you ! '' 
On the 18th of that month , Brown told the Rev. William G. Scandlin of Massachusetts -LRB- see the latter 's published letter -RRB- , that they had kept him there in prison `` until all his evidence had been sent away , allowed him but fifteen hours to prepare for his defence , and denied him the privilege of counsel . '' 
T was given me by Mr. Vance . 
Write by the next mail to William C. Vance , Washington , D. C. Tell him what has happened . 
Tell him how your mother died . 
He 'll be your friend . 
Tell Mr. Vance -- tell him -- his -- his -- '' Peek stood up erect , lifted his clasped hands above his head , looked beyond them as if watching some beatific vision , then dropped his mortal body dead upon the earth . 
Clara , since her parting from Vance , had addressed herself thoughtfully to the business of life . 
She thought of Vance . 
She knew he had resigned his colonelcy , and was now employed in the important and hazardous , though untrumpeted labors of a scout or spy , for which he felt that his old practice as an actor had given him some aptitude .
