By the bye , he has a very ugly name ; Hermsprong ; it sounds monstrous Germanish . 
`` Hermsprong , madam . '' 
`` I should hardly think that a disgrace , '' said Mr. Hermsprong . 
Mr. Hermsprong continued . 
It is probable , nay certain almost , that I owe my preservation to that very Mr. Hermsprong , for I never before heard of the name , the subject of your last letter . 
I must relate a part of our conversation , as it gives me an opportunity to inform you of all that has since passed betwixt Mr. Hermsprong and me . 
He called at my aunt 's , and sent up Mr. Hermsprong 's compliments , and an enquiry into our healths . 
I went down to thank him for my aunt and myself ; and asked him if it was in my power , or -- pardon me , Sir , if I presumed too far -- in my father 's , to serve him ? 
`` I own , my lord , I was of a different opinion ; and thought this modesty of expression rather enhanced than diminished Mr. Hermsprong 's merit respecting myself ; I replied to this purpose , and wished to be able to shew my gratitude . '' 
`` Well -- well -- Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
`` If so , -- '' Mr. Hermsprong said , -LRB- but checked himself , so that I can not guess what he was then going to say . 
After a pause , `` I am sensible , '' he said , `` your time must be now precious ; if I have never the pleasure to see you again , accept my most earnest wishes for every possible felicity . '' 
He withdrew with a haste which did not permit me to reply . '' 
`` So ended my conversation with my father ; and so ends all my knowledge , -- perhaps for ever -- of Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
At the conclusion of our sixth chapter , we left Mr. Hermsprong bidding good morrow to the Reverend Dr. Blick . 
Mr. Hermsprong , approaching Mr. Glen , asked if he was surveying the county ? 
To which he answered , that that was beyond his abilities ; this was merely a mathematical amusement . 
Mr. Hermsprong said , `` not indeed amongst civilized Europeans . 
`` Oh , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , smiling , `` you are upon your guard , I see , against the marvellous . '' 
There was in Hermsprong a superiority in science , and in elevation of sentiment , which Glen found it impossible not to admire , and difficult not to regard with envy . 
Their acquaintance was not cultivated after the ordinary manner ; they neither eat nor drank together ; for Hermsprong 's residence was an inn , and Glen boarded and lodged ; and each had more taste for morning excursions , for the discovery of nature 's more rare productions , plants or minerals ; and especially for the reciprocal communication of mind with mind . 
A sight of the encampment put Mr. Hermsprong in mind of his rencontre with Dr. Blick . 
`` I hope , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` you are not now giving a general picture of the English clergy ? '' 
`` I am as desirous to court the acquaintance of such a man , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` as of avoiding the Dr. Blicks ; and will take an opportunity to call of him . 
The good curate willingly accepted the invitation , and was so punctual that he arrived at the Golden Ball an hour before he was expected ; and before Mr. Hermsprong had returned from his afternoon 's excursion . 
`` Sir , '' said the landlord , with the air of a man who has something important to communicate , `` this Mr. Hermsprong is -- a -- a -- sort of a man -- one does not often see -- nor is it every man who would know what to make of him . 
A long draught gave Mr. Woodcock an opportunity to put his landlord in mind of Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` Thank you , landlord ; but Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
But we forget Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
`` Why , Sir , here he comes about ten days ago , at seventeen minutes past five in the evening ; himself on foot ; his servant on horseback , with his portmanteau , not coming in till eight . 
I observed him attentively while he eat me a twopenny loaf ; for I learned to read men under Marshall Keith ; and when he had finished , he did , for the first time , notice Tom Tunny , at the Golden Ball ; a man that , no disgrace to Mr. Hermsprong , has conversed with as good men as himself . 
He talked to me about prospects and old castles , and other trifling things ; it is true , he did not then know I had served under Marshall Keith . 
The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Hermsprong , along with Mr. Glen . 
The proper civilities over , Mr. Hermsprong enquired of Mr. Woodcock what liquor he chose ; to which the curate answered , Ale and a pipe were his luxuries . 
`` Then , '' said Hermsprong , `` this evening they shall be mine . 
`` Heaven gave us wine for a cordial , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied , `` and ale for a luxury ; and I make it a point of conscience to keep them so . '' 
Why , it has no more taste than -- '' `` Water , '' replied Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` No certainly , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` Englishmen are lions with beer , and heroes with brandy . 
Hermsprong had almost begun sternly to say , `` By what right , Sir , do you introduce a stranger to a select company without leave , '' when the cast down humble look of poor Woodcock disarmed his anger , and made him forbear . 
He contented himself , however , with slightly rising , and sitting down again . 
Now , here is Mr. Hermsprong has been supposing that I must be sorry that I did not fall in the field of honour with Marshall Keith ; but he is confoundedly mistaken . '' 
`` No , '' says Hermsprong ; `` nor in very civilized countries , any affection , -- not even the love of heaven . '' 
`` I believe , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` despise is not the proper term . 
`` Pray , Sir , '' asked Hermsprong , `` what is nature ? '' 
`` It is not your rudeness , '' replied Hermsprong ; `` your imposing tone , nor airs of superior knowledge , that shall deter me from telling you , Sir , that even Doctors may make superficial distinctions . 
`` I should suppose not , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` death is privation of sense ; can any evil happen to that stone ? '' 
`` Sir , '' said he , `` are you an atheist 's ? 
`` Then surely , '' said Hermsprong , `` it is not an evil . '' 
`` Let Tom Tunny look to that , '' said Hermsprong , gaily . 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , -- that is your name , I think , -- religion is not a jest . '' 
When he had finished , Mr. Hermsprong thanked him for the trouble he had taken , and drank his health . 
`` You are beneath my notice , '' said the Doctor , with great dignity ; `` but for this young gentleman -- '' `` I request , Sir , you will do me the favour to consider me as beneath your notice also , '' said Hermsprong . 
In a raised tone he said , `` Let me tell you , young man -- '' `` Stop , Sir , '' said Hermsprong , rising ; `` by what right do you presume to speak to me with the tone of a master ? 
Mr. Hermsprong left the room as he said this , and was followed by Glen . 
`` Is this , '' Mr. Hermsprong asked , `` a general specimen of the English clergy ? '' 
`` And is the want of this agreeable quality , '' asked Hermsprong , `` to be assigned as the cause of Mr. Woodcock 's not rising in the church ? '' 
`` You give me , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` a desire to know all that can be known of so good , and I suppose so odd a man . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong was about to enquire why , when a distant noise was heard , as it should seem , of angry people . 
This night I have been less affronted in myself than in my friends , if Mr. Hermsprong will permit me to use the appellation . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong replied , that Glen had been giving him a compendium of his history . 
`` Since it is so , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` why should we not leap the boundaries of ceremony , that bane of true affection , -- be at once old friends , and enquire what effect the quarrel of this night may have upon your happiness , Mr. Woodcock , and upon that of your family ? '' 
per annum , so immense a sum , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` that it can be supplied you no other way ? '' 
`` All ways , '' replied Mr. Woodcock , are interdicted to a parson , except the press ; and before he attempts that , he should be persuaded that he is possessed of some kind of talent , which may profit his readers as well as himself ; now , I have not yet persuaded myself of this . '' 
`` Preach patience , Mr. Woodcock , '' she returned , `` in the pulpit ; what you say there is all good and gospel , and woe be to those who offer to contradict you ; but out of the pulpit , Mr. Woodcock , you know no more than other people , and perhaps not so much . 
`` And how , '' says Mr. Hermsprong , `` do you think it will suit my feelings , to see the man I call my friend , reduced to write for bread ; whilst I , the cause of it , have superfluity beyond my inclination to use -- or abuse ? '' 
`` That air of surprise , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` seems to check my presumption ; and indeed the liberty I have taken is too great for the present state of our acquaintance . 
`` I hope , '' said Hermsprong , `` we may be able soon to get rid of the word obligation so applied ; with all its humiliating appendages ; for the present , let us close the subject . '' 
Once upon a time , in a fit of gravity , with which she is apt to be troubled at times , a young lady of my acquaintance asked me if I ever cried in my life ? 
For Mr. Hermsprong she seems to have a tolerable aversion . 
It may be simply his tearing her from dear Mr. Filligrove ; but there are other possibilities . 
Could he be playing the grave preceptor all this time ? 
His account is monstrous modest and respectful -- and all that , -- but meagre . 
`` I Wish I knew , '' said the lovely Miss Fluart , at the close of her letter ; and it is not impossible but I may have lovely readers , who would like to know also ; for it is certain , although Mr. Hermsprong had told the truth , he had not told the whole truth . 
Mr. Hermsprong had arrived at Ostend , in his road from Saxony to England . 
He had no sooner retired to his apartment for the night , than he heard , in the adjoining chamber , two voices ; one soft , tremulous , and plaintive ; the other rather harsh , and the tone more like one reproving than complaining . 
When Mr. Hermsprong had laid down in his bed , assisted by the silence of the night , and perhaps by darkness , he could hear a few sentences distinctly . 
In this strain went the dialogue on , till Mr. Hermsprong was weary of listening to it ; which , indeed , he never would have done at all , but that the name of Sumelin struck his ears ; and when to this was added Falmouth , he could not but suppose that the young lady was the daughter of the only man with whom he had correspondence in England ; and from whom he could expect any of the kind offices of friendship ; of the man to whom he was now going , and whose house he had an invitation to use as his own , so long as his pleasure or convenience would allow it . 
Mr. Hermsprong also knew that his friend 's family consisted of a wife and two daughters ; and he thought that the daughters of a man so worthy must have some merit . 
This , as Mr. Hermsprong suspected , was the love-favoured Mr. Filligrove , who had made too free with the wine of Ostend the preceding evening ; wanting probably more , or other comfort than the lady had to bestow . 
Mr. Hermsprong passed him with a good morrow . 
With more alacrity than his languid air promised , he sprung after him , with his offered hand , after the English mode . 
`` I am so pleased to see a countryman , '' says he ; `` would you believe it , -- damme if the stupid rascals here understand a word I say . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong , in whose esteem Mr. Filligrove did not stand high , and his foppish dress and familiar manner , was not calculated to increase it , said , but not with a tone of asperity , `` If it is stupidity in these people , not to understand your language ; what is it in you , not to understand theirs ? '' 
Off ran Filligrove , to communicate his joyful tidings to the ladies . 
Miss Sumelin was crying ; possibly from a little sprinkling of repentance ; for as the Duke Rochefoucault said , or might have said , for the remark is in his way , -- we are never truly sorry for our faults till we begin to suffer for them . 
`` Certainly , if you desire it , Miss ; but in my opinion you will do better without me ; for when a lady solicits -- you know what the poet says -- '' What the poet says , I know not ; but the lady consented to go alone ; and had almost passed Mr. Hermsprong upon the terrace walk unnoticed ; this gentleman being at the instant in deep consideration on the means he should employ to disengage her from what he concluded was a thoughtless and childish business ; a rustling awaked him ; from her dress , and her eyes red with recent weeping , he had no doubt who it was ; and bowing with great respect , said , `` Is it Miss Sumelin of Falmouth I have the pleasure to see ? '' 
I hope it is decided in the affirmative ; otherwise I know not what to plead for Mr. Hermsprong in the critical case before us . 
He was certainly saying the thing that was not ; and love , which excuseth all things , he had not ; he had pity only ; compassion for a respectable father , and a silly girl , who was probably running to misery for life . 
`` Besides , '' says a learned critic , whose judgment I respect , `` it is a deviation from character ; for the basis of Mr. Hermsprong 's is simple truth . '' 
`` Yes , '' I answer , `` to lords ; but to ladies , on certain great occasions -- '' But certainly Mr. Hermsprong is entitled to the praise of politeness . 
He told the lady she was handsome , in the most elegant way possible . 
How awkward it is to suffer Mr. Hermsprong to be kissing the lady 's hand , whilst you scribble two or three pages . '' 
As Miss Sumelin did not withdraw her hand , it was not in the nature of things that Mr. Hermsprong should give it up ; so he kept possession whilst they paced the terrace together . 
`` No , madam , '' answered Mr. Hermsprong ; `` but that is my misfortune ; I might have seen you before you had engaged your heart , had I earlier known its value . 
My name is Hermsprong , madam . '' 
`` Mr. Hermsprong ! 
Mr. Fillygrove , at this instant , came dancing forward in the familiar style ; a damme , my buck , was ready to burst from his lips , when an `` Oh dear , Mr. Fillygrove , do you know that this gentleman is Mr. Hermsprong , '' sunk him into littleness ; an effect , possibly , of the estimation he knew that gentleman was held in by Mr. Sumelin ; or , more probably , of a certain quantity of thousands which Mr. Fillygrove himself had given him credit for in his master 's books . 
Mr. Fillygrove , as soon as he could speak , said , he hoped Mr. Hermsprong would pardon the familiarity he had treated him with this morning , and do them the honour to take a breakfast , which was then ready . 
Mr. Hermsprong accepted the latter proposal , and had the goodness , as he led her along , to say many obliging things to Miss Sumelin , which , it is probable , she was full as much pleased with as Mr. Fillygrove , who seemed changed all at once , from the pert coxcomb to the sullen boy . 
Miss Wavel was preparing the tea ; Mr. Hermsprong was announced ; but as this lady had not before heard him spoken of , she thought nothing more of him than that he was the good-natured gentleman Mr. Fillygrove had just become acquainted with ; and she was surprised to find this young man mute , Miss Sumelin , reserved , the stranger pensive , and inattentive to the little attentions which , as dispenser of the breakfast , she had an opportunity to shew him . 
Breakfast over , Mr. Hermsprong addressed Miss Sumelin , requesting she would favour him with her company in his parlour , or in the garden . 
`` I have , madam , '' answered Hermsprong . 
asked Hermsprong . 
`` Very well ; the garden is a private one ; we shall all be less liable to interruption there than here , '' said Hermsprong , leading Miss Sumelin ; the other two condescending to follow ; but in no very placid dispositions . 
`` Pray , Mr. Hermsprong , -- I beg to know -- I desire to be informed -- whether you are disposed to oblige us , as you promised this morning ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied , `` I am disposed to oblige Miss Sumelin ; but not convinced that the mode of assistance you require , would be an obligation . '' 
`` I mean , Sir , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` that Miss Sumelin may one day think she has been too precipitate in a matter of infinite consequence ; and I would save her all possible regret . '' 
`` How it may appear in your eyes , madam , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied , `` is of little consequence to me . 
`` Miss Sumelin , '' he continued , `` is very young , and probably has not considered the consequences of a clandestine marriage , -- of offending her father , -- of disgracing perhaps her family . '' 
`` I venture to make the supposition , Mr. Fillygrove , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` because if you had just pretensions to the honour of Miss Sumelin 's hand , you would have taken more honourable methods to have obtained it . '' 
`` Honourable , Mr. Fillygrove , '' replied Mr. Hermsprong . 
asked Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` I presume , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` I have the honour of speaking to some near relation of yours , Miss Sumelin ? '' 
`` To be very sincere with you , madam , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` your care appears to deserve the animadversion of a court of justice ; and take care it has it not . '' 
asked Mr. Hermsprong , coolly . 
`` I think , Mr. Fillygrove , '' said Hermsprong , with a smile , `` we had better leave this species of folly to gentlemen born ; if it gets among gentlemen by assumption , where will it stop ? '' 
`` Impertinence , before ladies , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` does not merit a gentleman 's chastisement . 
Take that , Sir , which is due to you , '' giving the young man a hearty shake , and carrying him off with violence to some distance ; `` there , '' he said , `` Mr. Fillygrove , I am sorry you oblige me to use you with contempt . 
Do n't you see my dear Miss Sumelin is dying with fear ; but do n't be apprehensive , my dear creature ; I would not distress you for the world ; I will not call Mr. Hermsprong out ; I wo n't , indeed , my dear . '' 
`` Miss Sumelin , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , `` I am weary of these follies . 
Whilst Hermsprong was leading her back to the hotel , Miss Wavel began her abuse of Fillygrove ; which she extended so far , that the young man 's patience gave way ; he retorted her abuse , and swore that he would go back to England without troubling himself any more about her . 
I am certain I had it when I first met Hermsprong . 
In the interim a German girl , a lower maid servant came into the room where Mr. Hermsprong was reasoning the matter with Miss Sumelin , with this very watch in her hand ; and asked the lady , in her own language , if it was hers ? 
`` She enquirers if that watch is yours , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied . 
`` Upon your bed , Miss Sumelin , '' said Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , '' said the lady , `` I hope you give no credit to this audacious creature . '' 
`` I will believe precisely what you would have me , Miss Sumelin , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered . 
And yet , notwithstanding his complaisant powers of belief , he did , at this instant suspect an intimacy which Miss Sumelin had not formed . 
`` That 's impossible , Miss , '' said Fillygrove ; `` impossible ; '' and he began to abuse the poor girl in rough English , snatching the watch out of her hand . 
`` Is this the way , '' Mr. Hermsprong asked , `` in which you reward the girl for her honesty ? '' 
`` You will have the goodness to correct that expression , '' says Mr. Hermsprong , coolly , `` otherwise , -LRB- seizing him by the collar -RRB- I shall take the liberty to cane you , Mr. Fillygrove , till you feel your error pretty sensibly . '' 
asked Hermsprong . 
Mr. Hermsprong giving the maid directions , they all followed up stairs ; and the girl , laying her hand on the bed in which the two English ladies had slept , `` I found it , '' says she , `` just here . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong interpreted . 
`` Very well , '' said Hermsprong ; `` you are satisfied , Miss Sumelin ? '' 
`` Are you satisfied , Mr. Hermsprong ? '' 
The creeping , fawning explanation of Miss Wavel , with the awkward acquiescence of Fillygrove , had turned what was suspicion of Miss Sumelin , in the mind of Mr. Hermsprong , into a certainty of his mistake ; and , by the consideration of all the circumstances , he was convinced Miss Sumelin was a victim of treachery . 
Mr. Hermsprong began to grow weary , and consequently grave . 
A deviation from rectitude , he said , seldom produced any thing but a choice of evils ; and he asked which would be the greatest , to marry Mr. Fillygrove , after what had passed , or not to do it ? 
Mr. Hermsprong was trying to solve it , perhaps , for he was silent , when Miss Sumelin , raising her timid eye , and finding in Mr. Hermsprong 's unanimated face , nothing that pleased her , she resumed her pouts , and remained silent to all the gentleman was pleased to say . 
Quite wearied out , Mr. Hermsprong asked her if a walk , to see the town , would be agreeable . 
`` I see , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` my services are disagreeable to you ; so I beg leave to wish you happiness and a good morning . '' 
Angry at Mr. Hermsprong , she felt herself kindly disposed to the other delinquents ; one at least ; for what signifies what he did before he was married ; she durst say he would have been true and constant to her afterwards . 
Besides , she should never have known it , but for that impertinent Hermsprong . 
The dear young man , in the mean time , had met with Mr. Hermsprong upon the pier ; and much to the surprise of the latter , accosted him with a diffident and humble air , begging permission to say a few words . 
He then informed Mr. Hermsprong , that he had been at two shops , in order to sell his watch ; and not being able to make himself understood , had come hither to pick up an honest English sailor to be his interpreter , but had not been able to find one . 
Mr. Hermsprong asked . 
Mr. Fillygrove promised every thing , and was directed to another inn , there to procure an apartment for Miss Wavel , and wait till he could be informed in what ship they were to go . 
At the same time a message came from Mr. Hermsprong to Miss Sumelin , requesting her company to dinner . 
These were extraordinary circumstances ; but had there been no other reason with the ladies for compliance , curiosity would have been sufficient ; and Miss Sumelin had hers compleatly gratified after dinner , by Mr. Hermsprong , who informed her , with his true frankness of character , what he had done with respect to Fillygrove , and what he intended respecting herself . 
`` And I leave it to your choice , madam , '' says he , `` to permit me the honour of being your escort , or Miss Wavel . 
Miss Sumelin pouted , as usual ; and Mr. Hermsprong found her a companion so little agreeable to his taste , that he began to think it would be more for his ease to endure Miss Wavel . 
A similar revolution of sentiment had happened to Miss Sumelin : So , when Mr. Hermsprong told her that he should have the pleasure of giving up his opinion to hers , she answered , she had resolved to conform to his . 
A contest ensued ; but as the lady had stumbled on the flattering supposition , that in a téte-à-téte of two days and nights , she might display all her charms ; and Mr. Hermsprong having no sentiment which operated the contrary way with equal force , he gave it up , and quickly resigned himself to the dispensations of Providence . 
To reward him , the lady drew forth her whole stock of airs and graces . 
`` She is the daughter of my friend , '' he was obliged to say very often , and he did it with shortened breath ; `` shall I rescue her from disgrace , to plunge her into dishonour ? '' 
His name is Hermsprong . 
The conversation was stopped by the hasty approach of Mr. Hermsprong , who , with a respectful bow , said , `` I hope I see Miss Campinet well ? '' 
`` Never , '' he continued , `` could I see her more lovely than when warm with the healthful glow of humanity . '' 
`` Surely , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied , `` under any system , kindness to our suffering fellow creatures can not be sin . 
But that I would not subject you to scenes of distress , there is an object -- '' said Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` Dear Mr. Hermsprong ! 
Whether it was a glow of the heart , arising from the thought of being able to do good , or a simple blush at the `` dear Mr. Hermsprong , '' I can not exactly say . 
Mr. Hermsprong , however , did not appear to notice it in the least ; but said , `` The object I speak of , is a young woman , the school mistress of the village , thrown by this night 's horror into premature labour . '' 
`` A gentleman of the faculty is sent for , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` but I fear the rashness of those about her : It is better to keep her a little longer in pain , than expose her to danger . '' 
The Doctor returned a nod , and a look which had not in it much of courtesy ; for he felt himself offended by the careless air of superiority assumed by Hermsprong . 
Nor could he but remember the Golden Ball , and the dignified manner of his bidding adieu there . 
He scorned , however , to be directed by the puppy , even to a work of salvation ; so , instead of seeking the cottage of despair , he turned another way , asked a few questions , received mortifying answers , for they were in praise of Hermsprong , and then took his way to the Hall . 
I am not certain whether Mr. Hermsprong did not put the poor woman to more pain than nature did , for the sake of it ; for when they arrived the danger was over . 
The lady began it with saying , she was sorry she could not acknowledge her obligation to him a better way than by words , and that she must be obliged to chance or misfortune , even for that opportunity . 
`` For the latter , Miss Campinet , it is I who ought to feel the sorrow , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` and indeed fortune , or whatever god or goddess has the disposal of this part of my fate , does not treat me well . 
`` I could have wished your extravagance in that particular , Mr. Hermsprong , had been less . '' 
She had before thought him possessed of the finest face she ever beheld ; it seemed improved now by the animation which lightened from his eyes . 
But young ladies are not permitted to look long or intently upon young men ; so resuming her position , she said , `` Do you know any country in the world , Mr. Hermsprong , where this price is not paid ? '' 
Then , -LRB- added Mr. Hermsprong , with a smile , -RRB- I was born a savage . '' 
`` I must own , Mr. Hermsprong , you interest me . 
In reality she was afraid of her father 's displeasure , if seen with Mr. Hermsprong ; yet how could she hint her fears , or how be unpolite to a gentleman , she had more and more reason to esteem . 
The butler had been informing him of the ravages of the night , and , which unavoidably followed , of Mr. Hermsprong 's activity in repairing them . 
The person of merit also had mentioned to his lordship , that Miss Campinet had gone early out upon her charitable functions ; and had added , that no doubt , in her progress she would meet Mr. Hermsprong ; and that two such benevolent people could not meet upon so charitable a business , without being highly delighted with each other . 
Lord Grondale , though sufficiently attentive to such matters , did not just now regard the profound humility of Doctor Blick 's salutation ; but asked him abruptly , if he had seen that strange impertinent fellow , that Hermsprong ? 
`` Hermsprong told her of a poor woman in labour , and they went together . '' 
Lord Grondale , at the instant of concluding his last sentence , happened to cast his eyes on the spot where Mr. Hermsprong was taking leave of his heroic daughter , at the conclusion of the 20th chapter . 
cried his lordship ; `` damn it there ! '' 
Five minutes since you were coquetting with that impertinent puppy , that Hermsprong , who comes from you know not where ; and now you were permitting this worthy gentleman to talk to you of his hopes . 
`` I shall be much obliged to your lordship , '' said his fair daughter , with some degree of spirit , `` when you do Mr. Hermsprong the honour to make him the subject of your conversation , to be less personal to me , till I have really given you occasion . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong was mostly absent from the village ; Miss Campinet scarce heard the mention of his name , except when Lord Grondale chose to make him the object of his ingenious satire . 
You allow that this Mr. Hermsprong is very handsome ? '' 
`` I allow your progressive state , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` and if you will have it , that all is improvement , be it so . 
`` And perhaps is so , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied ; but of this addition your common people can not avail themselves . 
`` It should seem , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` that nature in her more simple modes , is unable to furnish a rich European with a due portion of pleasurable sensations . 
`` They also have exertion of intellect , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied . 
`` They do not , '' replied Hermsprong . 
`` No , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , `` I would not . 
`` Of this , '' said Mr. Hermsprong , smiling , `` I am little qualified to speak . 
This sally of the parson 's rendering Mr. Hermsprong curious , Glen was under the necessity of giving a summary of his life , much in the manner he has previously given it to his readers ; who will remember the share a Mrs. Garnet of Lime had in it ; her misfortunes and subsequent distress . 
Mr. Hermsprong , on whom the relation of the misery of others has a saddening power , became more particular in his enquiries respecting this venerable lady ; but when he learned that she was the aunt , the neglected aunt of Lord Grondale , his eyes flashed fire : He became at once thoughtful and silent ; and being now near the village , they separated for that day . 
On the next morning Hermsprong came to Mr. Glen 's apartments , and found him writing to Mrs. Garnet , in answer to a letter lately received from her , written not in the whining manner of a mind sunk and debased by calamity ; but with a dignified sorrow which seemed to think complaint beneath it . 
`` But , '' said Hermsprong , when he had read this letter , `` for the honour of human nature , I hope Lord Grondale knows not of this . '' 
Hermsprong 's eyes seemed to flame . 
said Hermsprong , `` the son of a king would not have escaped it from me , after such an insult . '' 
It is only necessary to remark that Mr. Hermsprong soon left Mr. Glen 's apartments , saying , he had an engagement at many miles distance . 
It consisted of an elderly lady , rather infirm , hanging upon Mr. Hermsprong 's arm , and followed by Mr. Glen . 
The other trio passed into the seat , now Mr. Hermsprong 's , in consequence of his purchase . 
It was a week after their last parting , before Mr. Glen again saw Mr. Hermsprong , who called again to say adieu , and inform his friend , that a certain necessity obliged him to be in London in three days ; and that he had to request of him to go to his house , and to entertain there a stranger who arrived last night ; and whom he must be so unpolite as to leave . 
said Hermsprong . 
`` Surely , '' Mr. Hermsprong , `` you can not think of walking ? '' 
But enough of this , '' added Hermsprong ; `` I must bid you farewell for a week ; and entreat you will spend that week principally , or wholly at my house . 
`` How far are you going , Sally , '' he asked ? 
`` Oh , Mr. Glen , '' she answered , `` I am going to live at Mr. Hermsprong 's . '' 
I have not , Mr. Hermsprong said , any peculiar skill in the science of physiognomy , but with eyes to see , something may generally be seen . 
He took my withered hand , and touching it with his lips , said , I fear , madam , this must appear an impertinent freedom in a stranger , but be assured , I have no impertinence at my heart . 
`` Over and above the inevitable stroke of destiny , madam , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` I learn from my friend , that fortune has been unkind to you . '' 
`` So extraordinary a proposal from a stranger struck me with a certain degree of astonishment , which must have been visible to Mr. Hermsprong , for he continued thus : `` I perceive , madam , my request is going to meet the fate , such presumption deserves . 
`` Indeed , Sir , you hold out flattering allurements ; but , Mr. Hermsprong , permit me to ask what good you propose to yourself in this ? '' 
`` Mr. Hermsprong said this with eyes so animated , and a countenance so expressive and intelligent , -- I think I never saw a face at once so handsome and so manly , -- I was upon the point of conceding to his request , without more consideration , when Lord Grondale came across me , and with him a tribe of reflections , never conducive to my health or peace . '' 
`` I can not , '' Mr. Hermsprong said , `` think him of the least importance . 
`` Why , my dear madam , '' says Mr. Hermsprong , gaily , `` if you are subject to fits of family pride , I know not with what weapons I can encounter so formidable a foe . 
For the affirmative , were Mr. Hermsprong 's open and manly behaviour , Miss Campinet , you , and my poverty ; for the negative , my pride . 
Unable to conquer this obstinate feeling , I was still fluctuating when he returned . 
He spent the evening with me , -- a confidential evening . 
He opened his heart , and a most amiable and generous one it is . 
All his communications I can not disclose ; but he sought and obtained my entire confidence , nor could I longer resist his wishes . 
In a week Mr. Hermsprong returned . 
His salutation of Mrs. Garnet was equally respectful and affectionate . 
Again and again he thanked her for the honour she did him , and for the pleasure she gave him by her kind condescension . 
She looked up to Mr. Hermsprong for his opinion . 
Let Lord Grondale blush , -- if he can blush , '' said , emphatically , Mr. Hermsprong . 
`` It was imposed on me as a duty by my father '' , Mr. Hermsprong answered , `` to speak , when I did speak , with the spirit of conscious truth ; and to act , when I did act , with the spirit of conscious justice . 
Let us leave it to its fate ; and only observing , that in consequence of Mr. Hermsprong 's sprong 's spirited support , Mrs. Garnet assumed courage enough to go to church , accompanied by the two gentlemen ; and this was the trio which infused , as parson Evans would say , a trempling of mind into Lord Grondale , and almost suffused his cheek . 
Even Mr. Hermsprong , whose walks were leagues ; whose meditations the whole phenomena of nature ; even he has been known more than once to stride a few miles out of his way , to look at this terrible crag , to think better of himself for having been this agent of providence , and to sigh that Caroline Campinet should be the daughter of Lord Grondale . 
It was Mr. Hermsprong who had spoken thus , and there was something a little like indignation in his face . 
`` No , Mr. Hermsprong , indeed I do not . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong now gave Miss Campinet a summary of Mrs. Garnet 's history . 
It was with some pathos he drew a picture of her distresses ; and concluded with the hopes and wishes Mrs. Garnet had so fondly and tenderly expressed . 
`` Indeed , '' said she , -- `` indeed Mr. Hermsprong , I wish to pay my duty to my venerable relation , -- to pay it this instant ; but , situated as I am , is it proper ? '' 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , your benevolent virtues excite my admiration . 
`` Stop , Mr. Hermsprong , I beg you stop . 
`` Miss Fluart , '' said Hermsprong , `` I ask a thousand pardons ; I have sinned dreadfully against politeness . '' 
`` I was indeed afraid I should not have had the honour of Mr. Hermsprong 's notice , '' said Miss Fluart . 
Mr. Hermsprong broke the first cold forms of ceremony ; Mrs. Garnet looked , rather than spoke her satisfaction , and embraced her dear relation with ardour . 
`` The lady was Mrs. Garnet , '' Miss Campinet replied ; `` the gentlemen , Mr. Hermsprong and Mr. Glen . '' 
To Mr. Hermsprong I owe my life . 
I did not know Mrs. Garnet till Mr. Hermsprong followed to reproach me for not taking notice of her . 
Mrs. Garnet is at present Mr. Hermsprong 's guest . '' 
So accident has opened you a road into Hermsprong 's house ; and made that which the world would call a breach of decorum , seem a duty . '' 
`` My dear , '' said Miss Fluart , `` his lordship means nothing by all this , but to shew his ingenity . '' 
`` But I can not really believe that it does appear to your lordship , that Mr. Hermsprong sought Mrs. Garnet with a view to give Caroline an opportunity to come to his house . '' 
In talking over the memoirs of the house of Grondale with Mr. Hermsprong , Mrs. Garnet came to be spoken of ; and this stranger , a compassionate man also , took it into his head , that the aunt of Lord Grondale ought not to want bread ; and having now a house of his own , he went to her , and prevailed upon her , I know not by what arguments , to accept this house as her asylum . '' 
The first mark of obedience I exact from her is , never , on any pretence , to enter Hermsprong 's doors . '' 
`` Hermsprong will follow her there , perhaps . '' 
To Mr. Hermsprong 's house , indeed , I must not come , after the harsh things my father has said to me on the subject , and the injustice he has done me by ill-founded suspicions . 
Much of my dependance , for the comfort of my declining years , I had placed in you ; and much , the idea of being known and beloved by you , assisted Mr. Hermsprong 's persuasion to remove to my native place . 
`` From the hint you give me respecting Mr. Hermsprong , I comprehend what would probably be Lord Grondale 's inferences , were you to come here . 
Lord Grondale , indeed , mistakes when he supposes Mr. Hermsprong capable of any clandestine proceedings whatever . 
He is the warmest idolater of truth , the most determined enemy of duplicity I have ever known . 
This footman his lordship ordered into his presence , and said to him , with a brow of awful menace , `` You have been at Hermsprong 's this morning ? '' 
`` Here , '' says his lordship , -- `` here is your footman tells me he has taken a letter from you to Hermsprong 's this morning . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong received this answer : `` Sir , `` I am ordered by Lord Grondale , my master , to let you know that he does not understand what right you can possibly have , to trouble him with your concerns ? 
His lordship was even in good humour , for he thought he had repelled Hermsprong 's impertinence with proper dignity , and never did he contemplate himself with more complacency , than when he believed he had kept this dignity in high preservation . 
Lord Grondale answered this by a new execration of Mr. Hermsprong . 
It would , or should be , quite as difficult to put in execution against Mr. Hermsprong , laws which he had never broke . 
For against the laws of England , or any laws but of pride and arrogance , he had not offended ; but , such is the constitution of great and noble minds , an affront is more unpardonable than a crime . 
`` Mrs. Stone , '' said his lordship , one day when he had gathered together a sufficient quantity of courage to begin the meditated battle , `` I could have forgiven that scoundrel , Hermsprong , a thousand affronts , better than that cursed one of purchasing Bellegrove . 
It was a trifle on which she had set her heart ; it was a reward she thought due to her merit and services ; and she had contemplated the probability of it , arising from his lordship 's increasing infirmities , till it had almost become certainty . 
It was not therefore without some degree of alarm , she had observed his lordship 's behaviour , for she could not avoid seeing some tender looks at least , to Miss Fluart ; it was preposterous indeed to think it could have any consequences ; yet she did not like it . 
All the civility , therefore , of his lordship 's speech , could not atone for the idea of separation which it inculcated , and which threw her into a momentary astonishment , not without some mixture of resentment . 
Recovering a little from this , she replied , `` She wished she could compliment his lordship upon his sincerity , as well as his politeness . '' 
My daughter has offended me ; she has got that Hermsprong in her head . 
his lordship asked . 
A most extraordinary odd gentleman has been with me this morning ; Mr. Hermsprong ; he requested I would pay his compliments to Miss Campinet , and Miss Fluart , and ask permission to pay his respects ; though he could not , he said , presume for that favour on any claim of his own , '' `` Oh dear ! '' 
`` But he imagined Miss Campinet would be pleased to hear of the health of Mrs. Garnet . '' 
But , pray , Sir , why do you give Mr. Hermsprong the character of odd and extraordinary ? '' 
At three , then , Mr. Hermsprong entered the dining apartment . 
His figure was interesting . 
But he had faults ; one for which it would be difficult to procure pardon in the court of politeness . 
It was quite disagreeable to Mrs. Sumelin and Miss Harriet , to see them , that is to say , the bows , the smiles , and the graces , hurried over to-day , in order to address himself more particularly to Miss Campinet , for whom he had brought a letter from Mrs. Garnet . 
He was afraid lest the inquisition itself , or the mode of it , might not be to the taste of his guest ; and therefore very bluntly and honestly asked Mr. Hermsprong 's pardon before hand , for any offence which might be committed , by asking impertinent questions . 
`` Impertinence can not be intended , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied ; `` conversation , to be agreeable , must have a certain degree of freedom . 
`` That , madam , depends on certain circumstances , '' Mr. Hermsprong replied . 
There was a small tinge of red on Mr. Hermsprong 's cheeks , as he said this . 
He had thrown a wandering and rapid glance amongst the other young ladies , who could never precisely determine at whom it was directed . 
`` Well , then , '' Hermsprong replied , `` they have too much . '' 
`` Perhaps , '' Mr. Hermsprong returned , `` we may be reconciled , if , as I suspect , you mean that English young ladies of a certain age and rank have too much liberty of person . 
`` Yes , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , -- `` such as they have ; minds imprisoned , -- which , instead of ranging the worlds of physics and metaphysics , are confined to the ideas of these routs and Ranelaghs , with their adjuncts of cards , dress , and scan -- I beg pardon -- I mean criticism . '' 
`` Some women are such things , Miss Campinet , '' answered Hermsprong . 
`` Energies , '' firmly repeated Hermsprong . 
`` Who has presumed to say , '' he continued , `` that the homage men pay to youth and beauty is insidious ; that women for the sake of this evanescent , this pitiful dominion , permit themselves to be persuaded , that their highest glory is to submit to this inferiority of character , and become the mere plaything of man . 
`` Well , then , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , `` let it be diminished on the side of -- charms ; and let its future increase be on the side of mind . '' 
`` When , '' answered Hermsprong , `` they are better taught . '' 
`` I know not , '' his opponent returned . 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , '' said Sumelin , `` this is pretty , and sentimental , but it cometh not of knowledge . 
In saying this , Mr. Hermsprong rose to go . 
When Mr. Hermsprong was gone , and after two minutes silence , Mrs. Sumelin said , `` I declare now I do not like this young man at all . '' 
Mr. Hermsprong did not return in an hour ; it was more than two ; and Miss Campinet and Miss Fluart were just gone their usual evening 's walk . 
He joined them , but had no longer the face of gay hilarity with which he had left Mr. Sumelin 's . 
`` Yes , '' said Hermsprong , with a sigh , `` she is unmarried ; indeed unmarried ; the widow of an hour . '' 
`` I insist upon it , Mr. Hermsprong , '' Miss Campinet said , `` we do not detain you an instant ; and , pray , tell me , can I be of service in any way ? '' 
`` Not to-night , Miss Campinet , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered . 
Mr. Hermsprong took her hand , and putting it respectfully to his lips , bowed , and vanished without a word . 
Either in the story itself , or in Mr. Hermsprong 's manner of telling it , there was something that repressed the gaiety even of Miss Fluart , and the ladies walked home in silence . 
On the next morning Miss Campinet rose earlier than usual , and when she came down to the breastfast parlour found Mr. Hermsprong there . 
He came to give her intelligence respecting Mrs. Marcour ; for she appeared to have taken an interest in that lady , -- an interest , which , as Mrs. Marcour was unknown , could arise from humanity alone ; and compassion for the unfortunate , accompanied with benevolence , was precisely what , in Mr. Hermsprong 's opinion , raised the female character to the highest degree of perfection . 
`` I am sorry to acquaint you , Miss Campinet , '' he said , `` that there is not yet room for the exercise of your gentle humanity . 
`` Have I deserved this , Mr. Hermsprong ? '' 
You know my father 's prejudice respecting you , Mr. Hermsprong . 
On his side , I have feared anger ; on yours , the imputation of ingratitude . 
says Miss Fluart , just entering , `` it must be owned , that if Mr. Hermsprong can not flatter , he can say very agreeable things , now and then ; only that his powers seem rather limited as to their objects . '' 
`` Shall I exert them , and tell Miss Fluart she is every thing that is charming ? '' 
`` Yes , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , -- `` for example , love ; love for your fair self . 
`` Certainly with , '' replied Hermsprong . 
He was now more at leisure to consider his other equally important concern , how best to rid the country of that poison to his pride , that Hermsprong . 
For , added his lordship , it appertains to my honour and dignity , to marry my daughter properly and speedily , that she may not throw herself away upon that low fellow , that Hermsprong ; whose impertinencies toward me still continue , or rather increase . 
For what , my dear Miss Fluart , do you think he has lately done ? 
His lordship 's last letter , on this important occasion , was to his daughter ; whom he reproached with having received Sir Philip 's addresses without his permission ; which failure , in point of duty , notwithstanding , he might be brought to overlook , in consideration of her happiness . 
At first , this was performed with the baronet 's usual abilities ; but the increasing intimacy betwixt the lady and Mr. Hermsprong , gave a shock to the kind heart of Sir Philip , and in the place of gracious doux yeux , produced looks of sullen gloom and fits of resentment . 
This increase of intimacy was occasioned by the unfortunate Mrs. Marcour , who , when she recovered her recollection , was kindly visited by Miss Campinet and her friend ; and more than once , when Miss Fluart was less disposed to compassion , by Miss Campinet without her ; on which occasions she was accompanied by Mr. Hermsprong only . 
This alarming circumstance was whispered to Sir Philip , by the generous Miss Sumelin , who , since her disappointment at Ostend , had sometimes permitted a little malignity to enter her gentle bosom ; and which was peculiarly excitable by Mr. Hermsprong and Miss Campinet . 
It was morning when the letters were delivered , and the ladies were just going , under the escort of Mr. Hermsprong , to call upon Mrs. Marcour . 
They broke the seals without ceremony ; and it must have been very amusing to Mr. Hermsprong , to see laughter bursting from the coral lips of Miss Fluart , and indignation flashing from the blue eyes of Miss Campinet . 
As neither of them , however , chose to make Mr. Hermsprong acquainted with the cause of these different emotions , they were obliged to suppress them for the present , and proceed to the business of the morning . 
Sir Philip stammered , -- Miss Fluart laughed , -- Mr. Hermsprong smiled ; and Sir Philip , growing angry , said , `` As to you , Miss Fluart , ladies may say any thing ; but as to this gentleman , it is neither mannerly nor respectful for him to laugh at nothing . '' 
`` If a man laughs at nothing , '' Hermsprong answered , what is there to be angry at ? '' 
Sir Philip , '' said Hermsprong , smiling . 
`` At your leisure , Sir Philip , '' said Hermsprong ; `` if you are not prepared to say now , take time . '' 
`` Better provoke a forest than such a man as Sir Philip Chestrum , '' said Hermsprong . 
replied Hermsprong . 
`` That I dare say too , '' replied Hermsprong . 
Hermsprong did not throw Sir Philip , he only lifted him gently over the rails , and set him down softly on the other side ; at the same time said , if I hear any more of these liberties of language , respecting Miss Campinet or myself , I shall correct them in a manner far less agreeable to you . 
`` Friend , '' said Hermsprong , `` I have no quarrel with you -- keep yourself our of harm 's way . 
The man , seeing his master safe , and probably not liking the rencontre , took quietly Mr. Hermsprong 's advice . 
Hermsprong was in an instant with the ladies , who had seen the transaction ; though they had not heard the dialogue . 
He found Miss Fluart laughing ; Miss Campinet in terror . 
`` You have terrified me exceedingly , '' said this latter lady ; `` Mr. Hermsprong do you consider consequences ? '' 
`` In these pleasant sallies of humour , '' Hermsprong replied , `` one seldom does consider consequences . 
But is there no other person of whom Mr. Hermsprong might reasonably be afraid ? '' 
asked Hermsprong . 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , '' said Miss Campinet , with a degree of solemnity , `` you have been lately endeavouring to persuade me you entertain an affection for me . '' 
`` They have indeed , if they have the power to direct or control their affections , '' said Hermsprong . 
`` And will she allow Miss Campinet to give up a splendid fortune for love and Mr. Hermsprong ? '' 
`` Caroline Campinet , '' replied Hermsprong . 
`` I know not , '' he replied , `` whether you have given , or whether I have stolen it from you . 
`` Mr. Hermsprong , '' said this young lady , with a more serious air than usual , `` that I esteem you much , I own ; but if you imagine that I can , in your favour , disregard my duties -- '' `` I ask no sacrifice of duty , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , `` nor any sacrifice , except of prejudice . 
But I tell you beforehand , I will not take it , if it be to throw myself away upon that odious Sir Chestrum ; or not to throw myself away upon that Hermsprong -- '' `` Stop , dear whimsical girl , stop ; and tell me if you think I am likely to throw myself away upon this last named gentleman ? '' 
`` Pray , favour me with your opinion of Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
`` He is moderately tall . '' 
`` Rather genteel too , if he would dress more en coxcomb . '' 
`` Can you praise him no better ? '' 
`` I have given him all the attributes which carry our daughters of blood and ton so fast into Scotland ; what would the girl have ? '' 
`` I had rather hear of the attributes of his mind ; his good sense , his knowledge ; his cool collected fortitude ; his intrepidity ; his contempt of meanness ; his sentiments so noble , so exalted , so soaring above the reach of common minds . '' 
I wish , however , we knew something of his birth , parentage , and education ; or are you willing to take him , as they advertize for stolen goods , and no questions asked ? '' 
That I esteem him , I own ; so much , perhaps , that it would be difficult for me to make another choice ; but between esteeming and taking , there is some difference . 
`` I really do not know what to say respecting Mr. Hermsprong 's putting any part of your lordship 's arms on Mrs. Garnet 's carriage . 
`` Pray , my dear , what did Mr. Hermsprong mean by saying that Miss Campinet might , if she pleased , have affluence as large as woman 's wish . '' 
May I not take the liberty to ask him ? '' 
`` It would appear as if I were really looking forward to a connexion with Mr. Hermsprong ; and I would not have him suppose I am employed about any such consideration . '' 
but how if he supposes such a wicked thing , without your permission ? '' 
`` Then , if he is disappointed , he will not have a just cause of accusation against me . '' 
`` No -- it will be all against his stars ; and perhaps , Caroline , you may be rather angry at yours . 
However , if your delicacy has declared war against your curiosity , mine have not quarrelled , and I shall certainly set him to talk of his forefathers , this day , upon our walk to Mrs. Marcour 's . '' 
`` Mr. Hermsprong 's compliments to Miss Campinet and Miss Fluart , -- a little necessity detains him from them and happiness , possibly for the whole day , -- if so , to-morrow he hopes will not treat him as to-day will have done . '' 
`` Pray , '' Miss Fluart asked , `` had you Mr. Hermsprong ? '' 
`` You did not see him yesterday ? '' 
`` On justice business ; Hermsprong the delinquent . '' 
`` Keep me , Sir , in happy ignorance , '' said Hermsprong , `` to whom , in this charming society , I have the misfortune to be disagreeable . '' 
`` Be ignorant , if you can , '' said Sumelin , as he retired . 
But indeed the happy lot of ignorance was denied him , merely because he did not take the precaution to shut his eyes . 
`` I hope , '' said Hermsprong , `` you are not disposed to punish Mrs. Marcour for my faults ; nor me so heavily as not to permit my attendance . '' 
They were no sooner in the fields , than the ladies required of Hermsprong a full account of the movements of the renowned knight , Sir Philip Chestrum ; which he gave in such a manner , that the fair ones could with difficulty confine themselves to that placid and dignified smile , which that great school-master of grace , the late Earl of Chesterfield , prescribed in lieu of laughter , to all the sons and daughters of men , who happened to be gentlefolks born . 
The morning was fine ; Hermsprong proposed an extension of their walk , and to call on Mrs. Marcour on their return . 
asked Hermsprong . 
`` That is , '' said Miss Fluart , `` when love began to die -- '' `` And something better , '' continued Hermsprong , `` had succeeded in its place , it became necessary to think of the future . 
`` It appears to me , '' said Hermsprong , `` that the story I am telling you is very tedious , and totally uninteresting . 
`` It is my intention , '' continued Hermsprong , `` to give you a sketch only of my father and mother 's story , for in their pacific retirement , there is little to gratify curiosity ; nothing to excite your compassion ; nothing to inspire terror . 
But of yourself , Mr. Hermsprong , you have yet said nothing . '' 
`` Women , madam , '' Hermsprong replied ; `` heavenly women ; such as a man might take to his bosom with a possibility of an increase to his happiness . '' 
Miss Campinet only smiled , and said , `` Suppose it so , Mr. Hermsprong , of what consequence is it , since you will not take the trouble to conciliate my father ? '' 
`` It is a question of too great range , Mr. Hermsprong ; but suppose it so , '' said Miss Campinet , `` does a breach on one side dissolve the obligation on the other ? '' 
`` I think so , '' replied Hermsprong . 
Nor , indeed , had it been necessary , would Mr. Hermsprong have had time ; for they were now entering Falmouth . 
It was first , to swear the peace against Hermsprong , which was done in due form ; and then to proceed to Grondale Hall with his complaints , his pedigree , and his rent-roll . 
When the baronet had given his lordship a full account of his lands and monies , intermingled , as Lady Chestrum had ordered , with certain genealogies of the Raioules , he proceeded to complain of Miss Campinet , as having greatly altered her courteous demeanor towards him , ever since the arrival at Falmouth of one Hermsprong , come from foreign parts he believed , and as conceited as sin . 
It is probable a little contempt for Sir Philip , mingled with the desire he had to be angry at Hermsprong . 
On the next day Mr. Corrow was sent for ; the business laid before him ; and Lord Grondale suggested a hint , that Hermsprong might possibly mean a robbery . 
Of late Lord Grondale had been so agreeably engaged , his time had passed so pleasantly , that he had thought of Miss Fluart with less ardour ; of Hermsprong with less violence ; of his daughter not at all , Bitter remembrances were now renewed . 
And yet to be thus familiar with Hermsprong ! 
His lordship wrote therefore to Miss Campinet in the most positive terms , to Miss Fluart in the most polite , commanding the first , and requesting the last , to set out immediately for Grondale , but without assigning a cause , or mentioning Sir Philip Chestrum or Mr. Hermsprong . 
Some speculation , his lordship 's letters must necessarily cause at Falmouth ; Miss Campinet , however , disposed herself to instant obedience ; and Miss Fluart , not bearing the thought of deserting her fair friend at so gloomy a crisis , his lordship had the pleasure of seeing her alight from the chaise with his daughter , a day sooner than his expectation . 
Fortune had been kind to him the preceding evening , he was higher in his spirits than in a morning was usual to him ; Miss Fluart appeared to be more lovely than ever ; as fast as he could fly , he flew to embrace her ; he forgot the letter she had written ; her commerce with Hermsprong ; every thing but herself . 
`` No , '' the baronet replied ; `` no , Miss ; I know you had rather have seen Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
`` Perhaps so ; for he has told me , that Hermsprong has constantly attended my daughter , ever since she has been at Falmouth . '' 
Has Hermsprong ever attended Miss Campinet at Falmouth ? '' 
Only have the goodness to give me some further information respecting Hermsprong and his designs . '' 
`` Why , he designs to have Miss Campinet . '' 
And she him ? '' 
`` Is it of any consequence to Miss Campinet to know , that if she marries Hermsprong , she loses all my fortune ? '' 
`` To marry Hermsprong ? '' 
is there no happiness for her but with Hermsprong ? '' 
`` Oh , -- not so strong as Hermsprong . '' 
`` Comparing him , no doubt , with that miracle of understanding , and every human excellence , Mr. Hermsprong . '' 
And you really , Miss Campinet , prefer poverty and Hermsprong , to affluence and Sir Philip Chestrum ? '' 
`` I speak not of Mr. Hermsprong , my lord ; but I prefer any condition to that of being Sir Philip Chestrum 's wife . '' 
`` Miss Fluart , to hear of my daughter 's marrying that Hermsprong , deprives me of patience . 
For Mr. Hermsprong says he loves me second best ; and I verily believe I should stand first , if Miss Campinet was not my rival . '' 
`` Its all along of you , Miss Fluart , and that there Hermsprong , '' said Sir Philip . 
`` Hush , Sir Philip , '' said this lively lady , `` walls have ears ; do n't talk of that there Hermsprong , he 's such a boisterous wretch you know . '' 
`` Yes , -- there 's a rod in pickle for him though , I can tell you that ; he 'll be glad to get off where he came from , I believe ; and then I hope , Miss Campinet , you wo n't be so cruel shy . '' 
In passing out , they were met by Mr. Hermsprong , accompanied by the man servant of the family , a man of a respectable appearance , who , on seeing the arrest of his master , had ran of his own accord to a neighbouring village , to advertize a friend of Mr. Wigley 's , of this unhappy business . 
This friend was not at home ; and the man , on his return , had met Mr. Hermsprong , whom he knew , and who , having observed his distraction , stopped him to inquire into the cause . 
The story was more pathetic than was necessary to induce Mr. Hermsprong to fly to the relief of this afflicted family ; and the more , as he suspected from the name of Lord Grondale , whom love , omnipotent as he is , could not make him think on without scorn and dislike , that it was most probably some act of tyranny or mean revenge . 
On meeting the two baronets , Hermsprong touched his hat , and complaisantly said , `` I am sure I see Sir Philip Chestrum here from a motive of benevolence ; I presume the same of you , Sir , whom I have not the honour to know . '' 
Hermsprong asked . 
`` The ladies , perhaps , '' said Hermsprong . 
`` You are right , gentlemen ; I perceive I was wholly mistaken , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered , and passed on . 
Sir Philip answered ; `` its that Hermsprong , that Lord Grondale hates so . '' 
`` And whom his daughter loves . '' 
`` I wonder what she can love him for ? '' 
He took me unawares . '' 
`` You were even with him . 
That swearing the peace against him was a damn 'd spirited thing ; and wife as spirited ; for the fellow is cursedly muscular . 
Confused and indistinct founds directed Mr. Hermsprong to the usual sitting room of the family . 
The first reflection which occurred to Hermsprong , you might almost call it an exclamation , was , `` What a total imbecility is here ! '' 
`` Most certainly not , '' Mr. Hermsprong answered ; `` if , as I learn from your servant , the affair is simply debt . '' 
`` Who , Sir , shall I say , -- '' `` My name is Hermsprong , madam ; I fear a stranger -- '' `` Hermsprong ! '' 
`` Hermsprong ! '' 
Mr. Hermsprong himself was astonished . 
It was new to him that his was become a name which humane people had learned to pronounce with transport . 
`` Are you indeed Mr. Hermsprong ? '' 
`` My friend , '' said Hermsprong , `` it is an acknowledgment of your humanity , not a bribe to neglect your duty . 
The bailiff took his present with a bow , and sighed as he received it . 
But Mr. Corrow had been under the necessity of accepting bail ; and his lordship found himself under fresh obligations to that bird of ill omen , Hermsprong . 
It was some time before Lord Grondale 's anger would permit his ears to open to the consolations of his lawyer ; who at length informed him , that he had proof that Hermsprong had endeavoured to entice Wigley to America ; which , though not directly penal , might , in the present temper of the times , be made something of . 
This complacent idea restored his lordship to tolerable temper ; so that he returned to the desert with Mr. Corrow ; who by the way , he desired to make Hermsprong the subject of his discourse . 
The obliging attorney knew it was not panegyric his lordship wanted ; so he turned his talents to obloquy ; and Hermsprong became , under his skilful hands , a tolerable monster of deformity . 
If Mr. Hermsprong thought , that by writing this letter , he should convey any spark of remorse or compunction into the breast of Lord Grondale , he deceived himself ; it only made his lordship mad . 
Instead of the polite irony with which he used to torment her , he now abused her in the vulgar tongue with all the power of language ; spoke , though not very intelligibly , of the new insult he had received ; swore , yes swore , he would stab her with his own hand , -- yes , with his own hand , -- sooner than she should be Hermsprong 's . 
Finally , he gave her his last , positive , and peremptory orders to prepare for immediate marriage with Sir Philip Chestrum . 
His lordship 's next step was to send for Mr. Corrow , who lifted up his eyes in pious astonishment , that a man so daring as Hermsprong should exist . 
Into the ladies ' recess Sir Philip could not gain admission ; he dared not take rides into the country for fear of Hermsprong , now more than ever terrible to him . 
`` Lord Grondale 's compliments to Miss Fluart , has received from Hermsprong another most insulting letter , wherein insolence is carried as high as it can go ; and in which he informs him that Miss Fluart has given him certain intelligence which ought not to have passed this house . 
`` Perhaps concerted it with Hermsprong . '' 
I taught her , that under your lordship 's paternal affection , she could not possibly fail of being miserable ; under Mr. Hermsprong 's conjugal one , it was not impossible she might be happy . 
Then Hermsprong wrote very moving letters , and said very moving things -- '' `` Said ! 
At the door of the garden leading into the village , she was received by Hermsprong and Glen ; for historical veracity obliges me to make known to my readers , that this was a concerted plan , and that these gentlemen were prepared to rescue Miss Fluart by force , had any insult been offered her , of which they were to have been apprized by the butler , a respectable man , who had seen with equal shame and disgust , the infamous treatment , for so he scrupled not to call it , to which his beloved young mistress had been subjected . 
Nor is Mr. Hermsprong an inhabitant of the same house ; his own delicacy pointed out its impropriety . 
Whatsoever Lord Grondale might have thought of the more dutiful and affectionate part of Miss Campinet 's letter , he was much too irritable to bear the praise of Hermsprong . 
Miss Campinet would have sickened and died perhaps , had not Miss Fluart laughed ; had not Mrs. Garnet soothed ; and had not Mr. Hermsprong reasoned . 
Whether his reasoning was just or otherwise , I do not decide ; but I believe it was efficacious . 
To drive Hermsprong out of the kingdom was of the first necessity to Lord Grondale . 
Not less was his unfortunate lordship embarrassed by Hermsprong . 
It had happened , that notwithstanding those singularities of Hermsprong 's character , which unfitted him for the society of English gentlemen ; notwithstanding he eat only to live , and had not yet found out the ravishing pleasures of the bottle , or those still more extatic of cards and dice ; yet there was something so engaging in his manners , that where he came , he pleased . 
Men , who could not find in their hearts to imitate it , applauded his benevolence ; and all admired his free and manly spirit , which had shewn itself in many instances , which a good biographer would have thought it his duty to record . 
But these were morning fears ; the evening consultations had more of spirit and of expectation ; and in the last of these , it was concluded , that Hermsprong should be summoned by Doctor Blick and another justice , before the whole bench , at the next quarter sessions ; that the most able counsel should be retained , and amply paid for his utmost exertion . 
Amongst the other minutiæ of information , it was told his lordship that Hermsprong was amongst the rioters , and had even been seen to give some of them money . 
In the interim , before the day of appearance came , no pains were spared to procure every kind of sinister information respecting Hermsprong . 
In passing along the hall , he had the mortification to see Hermsprong elegantly and rather richly drest , in conversation with Miss Fluart , and accompanied by many gentlemen of genteel appearance . 
In Mr. Hermsprong 's face appeared no signs of dejection , shame , or fear . 
He seemed all spirit and animation . 
His party took their seats , when the court proceeded to business , and he presented himself in obedience to his summons . 
Previous to moving for Mr. Hermsprong 's commitment , it was necessary to state to the court the reasons for such motion , and the advocate his lordship had chosen , addressed the bench in the following words : `` At a time when the nation is so greatly , excessively , and alarmingly alarmed , agitated , and convulsed ; when danger is so clearly and evidently to be feared , dreaded , and apprehended , from enemies both exterior and interior , it behoves the magistrates of the several counties to be wakeful and vigilant in detecting , discovering , and bringing to condign punishment , all traitors who are working and hatching their wicked and diabolical plans in secret . 
A person who calls himself Hermsprong , I suppose the same who now sits here in obedience to your summons , was seen many times amongst them , was heard to harangue them , and what is in this case a most suspicious and atrocious circumstance , and I dare say your worships will think as I do , was observed to give money ; to give money , gentlemen ; please to take particular notice of this . 
This person , Mr. Hermsprong , a stranger to her , who heard of her only by chance , has brought just under his lordship 's nose , as one may say ; and chusing to set up a carriage , I do not presume to know upon what means , under the pretence of its being the property of the noble lord 's rejected relation , has had the presumption to put upon it the family arms , an indignity I suppose no noble lord could put up with . 
But all these things are trifles to what I shall now mention , the highest of all civil injuries , the seduction of the noble lord 's daughter -- '' Hermsprong , whose countenance had hitherto exhibited no stronger emotion than a placid smile , now suddenly rose . 
The act of rising , and the fire that sparkled from his eye , stopped the pleader . 
said Hermsprong . 
But recovering himself , and bowing to the bench , he said , `` I ask pardon of the court , '' then casting an indignant glance at the advocate , sat down . 
There was something in Hermsprong altogether , which inspired the counsellor with a sensation resembling timidity ; at least , he lost part of that effrontery , so useful , and so used , in his profession ; and said , in a tone less exalted , `` The gentleman 's interruption did not give me leave to finish my period . '' 
Hermsprong looked full in the worthy magistrate 's face . 
`` Is it , '' Hermsprong asked , `` is it permitted me to deny ? '' 
`` It is not , '' said Hermsprong , rising , `` from confidence in my own abilities , that I presume to address the court myself , rather than by the aid of an advocate , but , totally ignorant of what I could be accused , it was not possible for me to give instructions . 
Mr. Hermsprong here ceased to speak , and the court remained a few minutes silent . 
A sort of astonishment seemed to have pervaded it , I know not whether produced by Hermsprong 's arguments or his intrepidity . 
`` That I went amongst them , '' Hermsprong answered , `` is true ; and that I gave money amongst them , is true . 
No answer being given , the junior justice of the bench , a young man who had just qualified , rose and said , `` Since nobody else will give evidence , Mr. Hermsprong , I will . 
Mr. Hermsprong answered with great mildness , my friend , it is to little purpose who I am . 
Mr. Hermsprong , without reply , knocked him down . 
This astonished the crowd , and not a hand was raised against him . 
Mr. Hermsprong called him back . 
My good friend , said he , `` I am sorry to have hurt you . 
I was separated from Mr. Hermsprong soon after , but heard that he continued late amongst them . 
Mr. Saxby , addressing Hermsprong , said , `` There does not appear any overt act , Sir , on your part , for which you ought to be committed to confinement . 
Mr. Hermsprong bowed . 
or is Hermsprong your real name ? '' 
Hermsprong , though he bore it many years , was not the family name of my father . 
When Mr. Hermsprong could be heard , he said to the bench , `` The proofs of what I have now asserted , you gentlemen , will not now expect me to give . 
Tears sprang to the eyes of Hermsprong , as he spoke of his father ; and as far as appearances could testify , he was honoured with the approbation of far the major part of the court . 
He could not disguise to himself his apprehension of the possibility , nay probability , that Hermsprong might be the son of his brother ; for he had contented himself with the report of this brother 's shipwreck , without thinking it at all necessary to be too nice and scrupulous in the investigation of its truth . 
Even did he live , it would probably be in some obscure corner of the earth where he should never hear of him more . 
For he stipulated to renounce his country , and being the fool of honour , he will probably observe his stipulation . 
His family having cast him of , he may have sufficient spirit to despise that family , and think it no longer worth a place in his remembrance . 
So disposed , he may never hear of our elder brother 's death ; and why should I go to inform him of it , by an impolitic research after himself . 
So reasoned his lordship ; and as it was the established custom of the family , never to speak of those who were thought to have disgraced it , and as his lordship lived very much in the world , where people learn to forget what they do not wish to remember , it is no wonder this brother should have been buried in oblivion . 
But although the reverend doctor and the man of law said so , it was one of those cases in which men usually allow themselves the liberty of saying what they do not believe ; for neither of them believed Hermsprong an impostor ; and as , since the day of the sessions , he had made the principal conversation of the county , and this conversation ran wholly in his favour , both these gentlemen thought it highly necessary to take some step of humility , in hopes of future favour . 
Had Mrs. Stone been politic , she would have forborn the least allusion to Hermsprong . 
That Mr. Hermsprong is the person he purports to be , I have no doubt . 
Although to me , he never gave the least hint of such a circumstance , to my aunt , as she says , he gave absolute proof ; or certainly she would not have accepted his presents , or have presided in his house . 
I own that I esteem him , and think highly of his probity ; but I can not resolve to give my hand to the man who reduces my father to adversity : That adversity , be it what it may , I entreat I may be permitted to share . 
It would separate her too from Hermsprong . 
Uncertain of her fate with Hermsprong , she resolved not to think of him ; and she resolved this perhaps a thousand times a day . 
Hermsprong has left England along with a Mr. Germersheim , the son of his father 's friend at Philadelphia . 
It was he , who , along with Mr. Sumelin , and two other gentlemen , accompanied Hermsprong in the county court , and it was he whom Sir Charles -LRB- I will call him Sir Charles when I remember -RRB- intended to call upon to speak concerning his father , had it been necessary . 
Mr. Hermsprong kissed her hand respectfully , and , the tear standing in his expressive eye , withdrew to his study . 
Having reflected there a while , he decided upon a certain course of action , and began it with the following letter to Miss Campinet . 
It was upon this young lady principally the conversation ran , of which I am desirous to give my readers a specimen , to shew still more the excentricities of Hermsprong . 
Hermsprong , taking her hand , and kissing it with equal respect and tenderness said , `` Madam , we will not part . '' 
Hermsprong observed this and said , `` I interpret for you , dear Woodcock ; your inclinations are with us , but you imagine obstructions . '' 
`` I do indeed , '' answered the parson ; `` a man with a family -- without fortune -- without talents ; at least , any that can be useful -- '' `` Stop , friend , '' said Hermsprong , smiling ; `` and do not abuse thyself . 
`` I love you , '' Hermsprong replied , `` with every sort of love but one ; that one is at present , Caroline 's exclusively . 
`` For that sentiment I can not love you less , '' Hermsprong answered , and then changed the conversation . 
In the mean time , the illustrious Lord Grondale , when disposed to meditate , fixed his attention on the means of turning the love and romance of Hermsprong to his own advantage . 
It was in the 5th month after the death of Lord Grondale that the happy Hermsprong , the name he still best loves , led his blooming Caroline to the altar , -- dressed in a white polonese -- pshaw -- dressed in love and innocence I mean , -- for of any dress , but of the mind , I know , -- yes , -- I just know a polonese from a cabbage net .
