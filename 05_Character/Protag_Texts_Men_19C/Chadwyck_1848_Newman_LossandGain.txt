Charles Reding was the only son of a clergyman , who was in possession of a valuable benefice in a midland county . 
No one on earth can know Charles 's secret thoughts . 
Did I guard him here at home ever so well , yet , in due time , it might be found that a serpent had crept into the Eden of his innocence . 
And besides all this , I am not equal to the task of forming so active and inquisitive a mind as his . 
He already asks questions which I know not how to answer . 
So he shall go to a public school . 
There he will get discipline at least , even if he has more of trial ; at least he will gain habits of self-command , manliness , and circumspection ; he will learn to use his eyes , and will find materials to use them upon ; and thus will be gradually trained for the liberty which , any how , he must have when he goes to College . '' 
This was the more necessary , because , with many high excellences , Charles was naturally timid and retiring , over-sensitive , and , though lively and cheerful , yet not without a tinge of melancholy in his character , which sometimes degenerated into mawkishness . 
To Eton , then , he went ; and there had the good fortune to fall into the hands of an excellent tutor , who , while he instructed him in the old Church-of-England principles of Mant and Doyley , gave his mind a religious impression , which secured him against the allurements of bad company , whether at the school itself , or afterwards at Oxford . 
To that celebrated seat of learning he was in due time transferred , being entered at St. Saviour 's College ; and he is in his sixth term from matriculation , and his fourth of residence , at the time our story opens . 
At Oxford , it is needless to say , he had found a great number of his schoolfellows ; but , it so happened , had found very few friends among them . 
Some were too gay for him , and he had avoided them ; others , with whom he had been intimate at Eton , having high connexions , had fairly cut him on coming into residence , or , being entered at other Colleges , had lost sight of him . 
And thus it was that Charles Reding was brought across William Sheffield , who had come into residence the same term as himself . 
What was the character and degree of that friendship which sprang up between the freshmen , Reding and Sheffield , we need not here minutely explain : it will be enough to say , that what they had in common was freshmanship , good talents , and the back staircase ; and that they differed in this : that Sheffield had lived a good deal with people older than himself , had read much in a desultory way , and easily picked up opinions and facts , especially on controversies of the day , without laying any thing very much to heart ; that he was ready , clear-sighted , unembarrassed , and somewhat forward ; -- Charles , on the other hand , had little knowledge as yet of principles or their bearings , but understood more deeply than Sheffield , and held more practically what he had once received ; he was gentle and affectionate , and easily led by others , except when duty clearly interfered . 
It should be added , that he had fallen in with various religious denominations in his father 's parish , and had a general , though not a systematic , knowledge of their tenets . 
It was a little past one P.M. , when Sheffield , passing Charles 's door , saw it open . 
Sheffield followed him in , and found Charles in his cap and gown , lounging on the arm of his easy chair , and eating his bread and cheese . 
Sheffield asked him if he slept , as well as ate and drank , `` accoutred as he was . '' 
`` I am just going for a turn into the Meadow , '' said Charles ; `` this is to me the best time of the year ; nunc formosissimus annus ; every thing is beautiful ; the laburnums are out , and the may . 
Sheffield laughed , and said that Charles must put on his beaver , and walk with him a different way . 
He wanted a good walk ; his head was stupid from his lectures ; that old Jennings prosed so awfully upon Paley , it made him quite ill . 
Charles laughed in his turn , but added : `` Yet , I assure you , Sheffield , that Jennings , stiff and cold as he seems , is , I do believe , a very good fellow at bottom . 
`` That is what I call bigotry , '' answered Charles ; `` I am for taking every one for what he is , and not for what he is not : one has this excellence , another that ; no one is every thing . 
And he took off Charles 's cap , and placing his hat on him instead , said , `` Come , let us be going . '' 
said Charles . 
Sheffield was turning into the High Street , when Reding stopped him : `` It always annoys me , '' he said , `` to go down High Street in beaver ; one is sure to meet a Proctor . '' 
`` Well , I do n't go along with your sweeping condemnation , '' answered Charles ; `` this is a great place , and should have a dress . 
`` The bidding prayer , '' said Reding . 
Charles was amused at all this ; but he said in answer , that he never heard a sermon , but it was his own fault if he did not gain good from it ; and he quoted the words of his father , who , when he one day asked him if so-and-so had not preached a very good sermon , `` My dear Charles , '' his father had said , `` all sermons are good . '' 
The words , simple as they were , had retained a hold on his memory . 
Whether Sheffield understood this or no , at least it was beyond Charles . 
Before entering , Charles hung back , and whispered to his friend that he did not know Bateman . 
`` Reding of St. Saviour 's , Bateman of Nun 's ; '' after which ceremony , in place of holy water , they managed to enter the chapel in company . 
Charles asked the use of the piscina , -- he did not know its name , -- and was told that there was always a piscina in the old churches of England , and that there could be no proper restoration without it . 
Next he asked the meaning of the beautifully wrought closet or recess above the altar ; and received for answer , that `` our sister churches of the Roman obedience always had a tabernacle for reserving the consecrated bread . '' 
Here Charles was brought to a stand : on which Sheffield asked the use of the niches ; and was told by Bateman , that images of saints were forbidden by the canon , but that his friends , in all these matters , did what they could . 
Now Charles Reding , a youth of twenty , could not be supposed to have much of a view in religion or politics ; but no clever man allows himself to judge of things simply at hap-hazard ; he is obliged , from a sort of self-respect , to have some rule or other , true or false ; and Charles was very fond of the maxim , which he has already enunciated , that we must measure people by what they are , and not by what they are not . 
He had a great notion of loving every one -- of looking kindly on every one ; he was pierced with the sentiment which he had seen in a popular volume of poetry , that `` Christian souls , ... Though worn and soiled with sinful clay , Are yet , to eyes that see them true , All glistening with baptismal dew . '' 
He liked , as he walked along the road , and met labourer or horseman , gentleman or beggar , to say to himself , `` He is a Christian . '' 
Such was Reding . 
But Sheffield , on the other hand , without possessing any real view of things more than Charles , was , at this time , fonder of hunting for views , and more in danger of taking up false ones . 
That is , he was `` viewy , '' in a bad sense of the word . 
He was not satisfied intellectually with things as they are ; he was critical , impatient to reduce things to system ; pushed principles too far , was fond of argument , partly from pleasure in the exercise , partly because he was perplexed , though he did not lay any thing very much to heart . 
Sheffield had a sort of contempt for it ; and Reding felt it to be bad taste to be unusual or prominent in any thing . 
`` If you had your way , '' answered Charles , `` you would scrape off the roads till there was nothing to walk on . 
`` Well , I really think you are hard on all these people , '' said Charles ; `` it is all very much like declamation ; you would destroy externals of every kind . 
`` To the meaning of those various acts , '' answered Charles ; `` the pious feeling , which accompanies the sight of the image is the music . '' 
`` I think you are hard upon England , '' replied Charles ; `` we are a religious people . '' 
`` You ought to know , '' said Charles , `` whom I have frightened so often with my fiddle . '' 
`` To tell the truth , '' said Charles , `` I do n't . '' 
`` Well , I did n't know we were so like each other in any thing , '' said Charles ; `` oh , the misery I have endured , in having to stand up to dance , and to walk about with a partner ! 
`` Perhaps you call those beautiful spires and towers a sham , '' said Charles , `` because you see their tops , and not their bottoms ? '' 
`` Then do you mean , '' said Charles , `` that the English Romanists are shams , because they do use crucifixes ? '' 
Charles was not satisfied . 
`` An image is a mode of teaching , '' he said ; `` do you mean to say that a person is a sham merely because he mistakes the particular mode of teaching best suited to his own country ? '' 
`` But this principle will carry you too far , and destroy itself , '' said Charles . 
`` But , my dear Sheffield , '' answered Reding , `` consider how many things there are , which , in the course of time , have altered their original meaning , and yet have a meaning , though a changed one , still . 
`` I think , '' answered Charles , `` that there 's a great difference between reviving and retaining ; it may be natural to retain , even while the use fails , unnatural to revive when it has failed ; but this is a question of discretion and judgment . '' 
A slight pause ensued ; then Charles added , `` But perhaps these men actually do wish to introduce the realities as well as the externals ; perhaps they wish to use the piscina as well as to have it . 
... Sheffield , '' he continued , abruptly , `` why are not canonicals a sham , if piscinæ are shams ? '' 
`` My dear Sheffield , '' said Charles , `` you have cut your own throat . 
Reding was surprised and shocked , and puzzled too ; he did not know what to say ; when the conversation was , perhaps fortunately , interrupted . 
We do not know what is the state of Oxley Church now ; it may have rood-loft , piscina , sedilia , all new ; or it may be reformed backwards , the seats on principle turning from the Communion-table , and the pulpit planted in the middle of the aisle : but at the time when these two young men walked through the churchyard , there was nothing very good or very bad to attract them within the building ; and they were passing on , when they observed , coming out of the church , what Sheffield called an elderly don , a fellow of a college , whom Charles knew . 
He was a man of family , and had some little property of his own , had been a contemporary of his father 's at the University , and had from time to time been a guest at the parsonage . 
Charles had , in consequence , known him from a boy ; and now , since he came into residence , he had , as was natural , received many small attentions from him . 
Once , when he was late for his own hall , he had given him dinner in his rooms ; he had taken him out on a fishing expedition towards Faringdon ; and had promised him tickets for some ladies , lionesses of his , who were coming up to the Commemoration . 
He was a shrewd , easy-tempered , free-spoken man , of small desires and no ambition ; of no very keen sensibilities or romantic delicacies , and very little religious pretension ; that is , though unexceptionable in his deportment , he hated the shew of religion , and was impatient at those who affected it . 
He had known the University for thirty years , and formed a right estimate of most things in it . 
He had come out to Oxley to take a funeral for a friend , and was now returning home . 
He hallooed to Charles , who , though feeling at first awkward on finding himself with two such different friends and in two such different relations , was , after a time , partially restored to himself by the unconcern of Mr. Malcolm ; and the three walked home together . 
Charles , by way of a remark , said that they had been looking in at a pretty little chapel on the common , which was now in course of repair . 
`` So , Charles , '' he said , `` you 're bit with the new fashion . '' 
Charles coloured , and asked , `` What fashion ? '' 
Charles laughed modestly , and said he hoped drinking had gone out every where . 
Charles said it was a nuisance to see the party-spirit it introduced . 
Sheffield looked slyly at Charles , as Mr. Malcolm proceeded with them up High Street ; and both of them had the triumph and the amusement of being convoyed safely past a Proctor , who was patrolling it , under the protection of a Master . 
The walk to Oxley had not been the first or the second occasion on which Charles had , in one shape or other , encountered Sheffield 's views about realities and shams ; and his preachments had begun to make an impression on him ; that is , he felt that there was truth in them at bottom , and a truth new to him . 
Two persons did not like it : Freeborn , who was simply disgusted at the doctrine , and Reding , who thought it a bore ; yet it was the bad luck of Freeborn forthwith to set Charles against him , as well as the rest ; and to remove the repugnance which he had to engage in the dispute . 
Reding put in his word ; he said that in the Prayer-book , belief in the Holy Trinity was represented , not as an accident , but as `` before all things '' necessary to salvation . 
`` That 's not a fair answer , Reding , '' said Sheffield ; `` what Mr. Freeborn observed was , that there 's no creed in the Bible ; and you answer that there is a creed in the Prayer-book . '' 
Sheffield talked through malice ; White from habit ; Reding came in because he could not help it ; and Bateman spoke on principle ; he had a notion that he was improving Freeborn 's views by this process of badgering . 
`` I have always thought , '' said Reding , `` that reason was a general gift , though faith is a special and personal one . 
''' `` But how are we to arrive at truth at all , '' said Reding , `` except by reason ? 
You know I wanted you , Freeborn , to go with me to see my chapel ; Sheffield and Reding have looked into it . 
Bateman thought awhile ; and Charles employed himself in scraping down the soot from the back of the chimney with the poker . 
Sheffield laughed out , nor could Reding stand it . 
`` Oh , he meant nothing , '' said Charles , `` indeed he did not ; he 's more serious than he seems ; do answer him ; I am interested . '' 
Meanwhile Sheffield ran to the door , and quickly found himself with Charles in the street below . 
Sheffield and Charles may go their way ; but we must follow White and Willis out of Bateman 's lodgings . 
Charles was of a different cast of temper ; a new idea was not lost on him , but it did not distress him , if it was obscure , or conflicted with his habitual view of things . 
He let it work its way and find its place , and shape itself within him , by the slow spontaneous action of the mind . 
Yet perplexity is not in itself a pleasant state ; and he would have hastened its removal , had he been able . 
Thus the principle of dogmatism gradually became an essential element in Charles 's religious views . 
Gradually , and imperceptibly to himself ; for the thoughts which we have been tracing only came on him at spare times , and were taken up at intervals from the point at which they were laid down . 
His lectures and other duties of the place , his friends and recreations , were the staple of the day ; but there was this under-current , ever in motion , and sounding in his mental ear as soon as other sounds were hushed . 
As he dressed in the morning , as he sat under the beeches of his college-garden , when he strolled into the Meadow , when he went into the town to pay a bill or make a call , when he threw himself on his sofa after shutting his oak at night , thoughts cognate with those which have been described were busy within him . 
Charles did not understand the full drift of the sermon ; but he understood enough to make him feel that it was different from any sermon he had heard in his life . 
He more than doubted , whether , if his good father had heard it , he would not have made it an exception to his favourite dictum . 
He came away marvelling with himself what the preacher could mean , and whether he had misunderstood him . 
So Charles went on , painfully perplexed , yet out of this perplexity two convictions came upon him , the first of them painful too ; -- that he could not take for gospel every thing that was said even by authorities of the place and divines of name ; and next , that his former amiable feeling of taking every one for what he was , was a dangerous one , leading with little difficulty to a sufferance of every sort of belief , and legitimately terminating in the sentiment expressed in Pope 's Universal Prayer , which his father had always held up to him as a pattern specimen of shallow philosophism : `` Father of all , in every age , In every clime adored , By saint , by savage , and by sage , Jehovah , Jove , or Lord . '' 
Charles went up this term for his first examination , and this caused him to remain in Oxford some days after the undergraduate part of his college had left for the Long Vacation . 
Thus he came across Mr. Vincent , one of the junior tutors , who was kind enough to ask him to dine in Common-room on Sunday , and on several mornings made him take some turns with him up and down the Fellows ' walk in the college-garden . 
At the present moment he was on the point of starting for a continental tour to recruit himself after the labours of an Oxford year ; meanwhile he was keeping hall and chapel open for such men as were waiting either for Responsions , or for their battle-money ; and he took notice of Reding as a clever modest youth , of whom something might be made . 
`` I prefer the green of England , '' said Reding . 
`` But I ca n't help fancying , '' said Charles , `` that that mixture of colours takes off the repose of English scenery . '' 
`` Say in summer , '' said Reding ; `` if you choose place , I will choose time . 
`` Reding ought to live here all through the Long , '' said Tenby : `` does any one live through the Vacation , sir , in Oxford ? '' 
`` Well , I think I should like to make it so , '' said Charles ; `` but , I suppose , undergraduates are not allowed . '' 
Charles answered that , if it was against college-rules , there was no help for it ; else , were he reading for his degree , he should like nothing better than to pass the Long Vacation in Oxford , if he might judge by the pleasantness of the last ten days . 
By this time , Charles found himself alone with the college authority ; who began to speak to him in a more confidential tone . 
`` Mr. Reding , '' said he , `` I did not like to question you before the others , but I conceive you had no particular meaning in your praise of Oxford in the Long Vacation ? 
Charles was all surprise . 
`` To tell the truth , Mr. Reding , as things stand , '' he proceeded , `` it is often a mark of party , this residence in the Vacation ; though , of course , there is nothing in the thing itself but what is perfectly natural and right . '' 
Charles was all attention . 
Reding expressed a hope , that nothing he had done had given cause to his tutor 's remark . 
Charles was so much taken aback by the charge , that the unexplained mystery of the Long Vacation went out of his head . 
He said , he was `` very sorry , '' and `` obliged ; '' and tried to recollect what he could have said to give ground to Mr. Vincent 's remark . 
Charles thought this a good opportunity of asking some questions in detail , about points which puzzled him . 
He asked whether Dr. Brownside was considered a safe divine to follow . 
Charles said , in answer , that Mr. Vincent was overrating his powers ; that he had to learn before he could judge ; and that he wished very much to know whether Vincent could recommend him any book , in which he might see at once what the true Church-of-England doctrine was on a number of points which perplexed him . 
It was prose , but it was pleasant prose to Charles ; he knew just enough about these writers to feel interested in hearing them talked about , and to him Vincent seemed to be saying a good deal , when in fact he was saying very little . 
When he stopped , Charles said he believed that there were persons in the University who were promoting the study of these authors . 
But it is one thing to agree with these gentlemen ; another , '' laying his hand on Charles 's shoulder , `` another to belong to their party . 
Reding inquired , with some timidity , if this was not something like what Dr. Brownside had said in the University pulpit ; but perhaps the latter advocated a toleration of opinions in a different sense ? 
When Charles came away , he tried to think what he had gained by his conversation with Mr. Vincent ; not exactly what he had wanted , some practical rules to guide his mind and keep him steady , but still some useful hints . 
No opportunity has occurred of informing the reader that , during the last week or two , Charles had accidentally been a good deal thrown across Willis , the umbra of White at Bateman 's breakfast-party . 
He certainly did court Charles , and seemed anxious to stand well with him . 
Charles , however , did not like his mode of talking better than he did White 's ; and when he first saw his rooms , there was much in them which shocked both his good sense and his religious principles . 
On the mantel-piece were a rosary , a thuribulum , and other tokens of Catholicism , of which Charles did not know the uses ; a missal , ritual , and some Catholic tracts , lay on the table ; and , as he happened to come on Willis unexpectedly , he found him sitting in a vestment more like a cassock than a reading gown , and engaged upon some portion of the Breviary . 
Charles had taken upon himself to protest against some of these singularities , but without success . 
On the evening before his departure for the country , he had occasion to go towards Folly Bridge to pay a bill , when he was startled , as he passed what he had ever taken for a dissenting chapel , to see Willis come out of it . 
He hardly could believe he saw correctly ; he knew , indeed , that Willis had been detained in Oxford , as he had been himself ; but what had compelled him to a visit so extraordinary as that which he had just made , Charles had no means of determining . 
`` Willis , '' he cried , as he stopped . 
`` Do come a few paces with me , '' said Charles . 
cried Willis , surprised and offended in his turn ; `` what on earth could make you think I would go to a dissenting meeting ? '' 
`` Well , I beg your pardon , '' said Charles ; `` I recollect now ; it 's the exhibition-room . 
Charles talked on , to cover his own mistake , for he was ashamed of the charge he had made . 
`` Reding , '' he said , `` do n't go on ; you offend me . '' 
said Charles . 
Reding was silent a moment ; then he said : `` Well , I do n't think you have mended the matter ; it is a dissenting meeting , call it what you will ; though not the kind of one I meant . '' 
retorted Charles ; `` why , it is against your oath . '' 
`` There 's not an oath now ; but there was an oath till lately , '' said Reding ; `` and we still make a very solemn engagement . 
`` You did more , '' said Reding . 
`` Oh , do n't speak so , '' said Charles ; `` you know it 's meant to include them . 
said Charles ; `` the priest put that into your head . '' 
`` Well , any how , it 's not your own answer , '' said Reding ; `` and does not help you . 
`` Well , if we do n't keep them , '' said Charles , `` I suppose it is in points where the authorities do n't enforce them ; for instance , they do n't mean us to dress in brown , though the statutes order it . '' 
`` But this is a different matter , '' said Reding , changing his ground ; `` this is a matter of religion . 
`` I 'm no divine , I do n't understand what is meant by one Church , '' said Charles ; `` but I know well that there 's not a Bishop , not a clergyman , not a sober Churchman in the land but would give it against you . 
`` That 's just what every stiff dissenter says , '' answered Charles ; `` every poor cottager too , who knows no better , and goes after the Methodists , after dear Mr. Spoutaway or the preaching cobbler , she says -LRB- I have heard them -RRB- , ` Oh , sir , I suppose we ought to go where we get most good . 
''' Willis laughed ; `` Well , not a bad reason , as times go , I think , '' said he : `` poor souls , what better means of judging have they ? 
Charles looked very uncomfortable . 
`` Really , Willis , '' he said , `` I do n't know what to say to you . 
I do n't like it , '' he added with vehemence ; `` it 's taking liberties with God . '' 
`` Oh , my dear Reding , please do n't speak so very severely , '' said poor Willis ; `` now what have I done more than you would do yourself , were you in France or Italy ? 
`` I will only decide about what is before me , '' answered Reding ; `` when I go abroad , then will be the time to think about your question . 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` you must promise me you will not go again . 
`` That is too much , '' said Willis gently ; then , disengaging his arm from Reding 's , he suddenly darted away from him , saying , `` Good-bye , good-bye ; to our next merry meeting -- au revoir . '' 
Charles walked slowly home , saying to himself . 
Then he thought : `` I suppose I know quite enough for practice -- more than I do practise ; and I ought surely to be contented and thankful . '' 
Charles was an affectionate son , and the Long Vacation passed very happily at home . 
He was up early , and read steadily till luncheon , and then he was at the service of his father , mother , and sisters for the rest of the day . 
He loved the calm , quiet country ; he loved the monotonous flow of time , when each day is like the other ; and , after the excitement of Oxford , the secluded parsonage was like a haven beyond the tossing of the waves . 
The whirl of opinions and perplexities which had encircled him at Oxford , now were like the distant sound of the ocean -- they reminded him of his present security . 
He had been a great favourite with Charles and his sisters as children , though now his popularity with them for the most part rested on the memory of the past . 
When he told them amusing stories , or allowed them to climb his knee and take off his spectacles , he did all that was necessary to gain their childish hearts ; more is necessary to conciliate the affection of young men and women ; and thus it is not surprising that he lived in their minds principally by prescription . 
He neither knew this , nor would have thought much about it , if he had ; for , like many persons of advancing years , he made himself very much his own centre , did not care to enter into the minds of others , did not consult for them , or find his happiness in them . 
He was kind and friendly to the young people , as he would be kind to a canary-bird or a lap-dog ; it was a sort of external love ; and , though they got on capitally with him , they did not miss him when gone , nor would have been much troubled to know that he was never to come again . 
Charles drove him about the country , stamped his letters , secured him his newspapers from the neighbouring town , and listened to his stories about Oxford and Oxford men . 
He really liked him , and wished to please him ; but , as to consulting him in any serious matter , or going to him for comfort in affliction , he would as soon have thought of betaking him to Dan the pedlar , or old Isaac who played the Sunday bassoon . 
`` At that time too , '' said Charles , `` I suppose , the more expensive fruits were not cultivated . 
`` Charles is secretly cutting at our hot-house here , '' said Mr. Reding ; `` as if our first father did not prefer fruits and flowers to beef and mutton . '' 
`` No , indeed , '' said Charles , `` I think peaches capital things ; and as to flowers , I am too fond even of scents . '' 
`` Charles has some theory , then , about scents I 'll be bound , '' said his father ; `` I never knew a boy who so placed his likings and dislikings on fancies . 
`` Every one does so , '' said Charles : `` who would not be in the fashion ? 
`` You 're right , papa , in this instance , '' said his mother ; `` I know he has some good reason , though I never can recollect it , why he smells a rose , or distils lavender . 
`` Why , sir , that was precisely your own reason just now , '' said Charles to his father . 
said his mother . 
`` Well , so they are in a certain way , '' said Charles ; `` but I ca n't explain . 
`` Well , I grant it , Charles , '' he said ; `` they are length without breadth . '' 
said Mrs. Reding , laughing too ; `` do n't encourage him , Mr. Malcolm ; you are worse than he . 
`` They conjure up the past so vividly , '' said Charles . 
`` But sounds surely more than scents , '' said Charles . 
`` Pardon me ; the reverse , as I think , '' answered Charles . 
`` That is a paradox , Charles , '' said Mr. Malcolm ; `` the smell of roast beef never went further than to remind a man of dinner ; but sounds are pathetic and inspiring . '' 
`` Well , sir , but think of this , '' said Charles ; `` scents are both complete in themselves , yet do not consist of parts . 
`` Charles has n't been to Oxford for nothing , '' said his mother , laughing and looking at Mary ; `` this is what I call chopping logic ! '' 
`` Well done , Charles ! '' 
`` Well , sir , '' answered Charles , `` some people do seem to thrive on snuff at least . '' 
`` For shame , Charles ! '' 
There was old Dr. Troughton of Nun 's Hall , he carried his snuff loose in his pocket ; and old Mrs. Vice-Principal Daffy used to lay a train along her arm , and fire it with her nose . 
Charles , do n't you be an old bachelor . 
Charles slightly coloured , and his sister laughed , as if there was some understanding between them . 
said Charles . 
`` Dear Charles will make a kind affectionate husband , I am sure , '' said his mother , `` when the time comes ; -- and come it will , though not just yet . 
Yes , my dear boy , '' she added , nodding at him , `` you will not be able to escape your destiny , when it comes . '' 
`` Charles , you must know , '' said Mr. Reding to his guest , `` is romantic in his notions just now . 
I believe it is , that he thinks no one good enough for him . 
`` I am sure , '' said Mary , `` Charles is most attentive whenever there is occasion , and always has his eyes about him to do a service ; only he 's a bad hand at small talk . '' 
`` Oh , spare me , sir , '' said poor Charles ; `` how have I deserved this ? '' 
`` Come , Mary , your turn is coming , '' cried Charles ; and taking his sister 's hand , he threw up the sash , and escaped with her into the garden . 
`` Indeed it is n't he that is changed , '' said Charles , `` but we ; we are in the time of life to change ; we have changed already , and shall change still . '' 
`` What a mercy it is , '' said his sister , `` that we are so happy among ourselves as a family ! 
`` It is a mercy indeed , '' said Charles ; `` we are so blessed , that I am sometimes quite frightened . '' 
His sister looked earnestly at him . 
He laughed a little , to turn off the edge of his seriousness . 
`` My dear Charles , if we do but enjoy God 's gifts thankfully and take care not to set our hearts on them or to abuse them , we need not fear for their continuance . '' 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` there 's one text which has ever dwelt on my mind , ` Rejoice with trembling . ' 
`` I do n't defend it , '' he replied ; `` it 's my way ; it may be a selfish prudence , for what I know ; but I am sure , that , did I give my heart to any creature , I should be withdrawing it from God . 
Charles made no answer . 
`` What has come to you , dear Charles ? '' 
she said , stopping and looking at him ; then , gently removing his hair and smoothing his forehead , she said , `` You are so sad to-day . '' 
`` Dearest Mary , '' he made answer , `` nothing 's the matter , indeed . 
`` What I mean is , '' continued Charles , `` that we can rely on nothing here , and are fools if we build on the future . '' 
She looked round at him surprised , and almost frightened herself . 
`` Dearest , '' he continued , `` I mean nothing ; only every thing is so uncertain here below . '' 
`` We are sure of each other , Charles . '' 
`` Yes , Mary , '' and he kissed her affectionately , `` it is true , most true ; '' then he added , `` all I meant was , that it seems presumptuous to say so . 
`` Oh , what an ass I am , '' he said , `` for thus teasing you about nothing ; no , I only mean that there is One only who can not die , who never changes , only one . 
I know them without having learned them -- they struck me so much the first time I read them : '' -- and he repeated them : Thou art the source and centre of all minds , Their only point of rest , Eternal Word . 
October came at length , and with it Charles 's thoughts were turned again to Oxford . 
His father parted with him with even greater emotion than when he first went to school . 
He would himself drive him in the phaeton to the neighbouring town , from which the omnibus ran to the railroad , though he had the gout flying about him ; and when the moment for parting came , he could not get himself to give up his hand , as if he had something to say which he could not recollect or master . 
`` Well , Christmas will soon come , '' he said ; `` we must part ; it 's no use delaying it . 
Your tutor seems a valuable man , from what you tell me , '' he went on , -- repeating what had passed between him and Charles many times before ; `` a sound , well-judging man , that Mr. Vincent . 
Good-bye , my beloved Charles , good-bye ! '' 
Charles had to pass a day or two at the house of a relative who lived a little way out of London . 
While he was there , a letter arrived for him , forwarded from home ; it was from Willis , dated from London , and announced that he had come to a very important decision , and should not return to Oxford . 
Charles was fairly in the world again , plunged into the whirl of opinions ! 
how sad a contrast to his tranquil home ! 
There was no mistaking what the letter meant ; and he set out at once with the chance of finding the writer at the house from which he dated it . 
It was a lodging at the west-end of the town ; and he reached it about noon . 
He found Willis in company with a person apparently two or three years older . 
A happy meeting ; sit down , dear Reding ; I have much to tell you . '' 
Charles sat down all suspense , looking at Willis with such keen anxiety , that the latter was forced to cut the matter short . 
`` Reding , I am a Catholic . '' 
Charles threw himself back in his chair , and turned pale . 
`` My dear Reding , what 's the matter with you ? 
Charles was still silent ; at last , stooping forward , with his elbows on his knees , and his head on his hands , he said in a low voice , `` O Willis , what have you done ! '' 
O Reding , I 'm so happy ! '' 
said Charles ; `` but what is the good of my staying ? 
`` No , my good Reding , you do n't leave me so soon , having found me so unexpectedly ; and you have had a long walk , I dare say ; sit down , there 's a good fellow ; we shall have luncheon soon , and you must not go without taking your part in it . '' 
He took Charles 's hat from him , as he spoke ; and Charles , in a mixture of feelings , let him have his way . 
he said ; `` you have taken your course , we keep ours ; our paths are different . '' 
Charles was half offended ; `` Really I must go , '' he said , and he rose ; `` you must not talk in that manner . '' 
A thought struck Reding . 
`` Reding , let me introduce Mr. Morley ; Morley , Mr. Reding . 
Yes , Reding , I owe it to him that I am a Catholic . 
I have been on a tour with him abroad . 
`` Well , I think he might profitably have examined into your state of mind a little before he did so , '' said Reding ; `` you are not the person to become a Catholic , Willis . '' 
`` Because , '' answered Reding , `` you are more of a dissenter than a Catholic . 
`` I see you have disobeyed men , '' retorted Charles ; `` I trust you have been obeying God . '' 
`` Well , sir , perhaps I have been unjust to him and you , '' said Charles ; `` however , I can not augur well of this . '' 
Charles felt himself reproved by his manner ; his good taste suggested to him that he had been too vehement in the presence of a stranger ; yet he did not feel the less confidence in his cause . 
He paused before he answered ; then he said briefly , that he was aware that he did not know the Roman Catholic religion , but he knew Mr. Willis . 
This was a home-thrust ; the controversies of Oxford passed before Reding 's mind ; but he instantly recovered himself . 
Here Willis cried out , `` O my dear Reding , what I say is , ` Come and see . ' 
`` But , '' said Reding , `` surely God wills us to be guided by reason ; I do n't mean that reason is everything , but it is at least something . 
`` Willis , you have misunderstood me most extraordinarily , '' said Charles : `` ten thousand thoughts pass through the mind , and if it is safe to note down and bring against a man his stray words , I suppose there 's nothing he may n't be accused of holding . 
My dear Reding , can you sincerely plead that you are in invincible ignorance after what has passed between us ? 
Reding was perplexed how to answer ; that is , he could not with the necessary quickness analyse and put into words the answer which his reason suggested to Willis 's rapid interrogatories . 
Mr. Morley had kept silence , lest Charles should have two upon him at once ; but when Willis paused , and Charles did not reply , he interposed . 
Reding answered , that in those cases the voice of Christ was actually heard ; He was on earth , in bodily presence ; now , however , the very question was , which was the voice of Christ ? 
Charles hesitated to answer . 
And before Charles could shew any resistance , he was half out of the room . 
He could not help laughing , in spite of his vexation ; he disengaged his arm , and deliberately sat down . 
`` Not so fast , '' he said ; `` we are not quite this sort of person . '' 
Reding , it is just what you want , just what all Oxford men want ; I think you will not refuse me . '' 
Charles looked up in his face , and smiled . 
`` It is not my line , '' he said at length , `` I am on my way to Oxford . 
And he went on brushing his hat with his glove , as if on the point of rising , yet loath to rise . 
`` I ca n't persuade these good people , '' thought Charles , as he closed the street-door after him , `` that I am not in a state of conviction , and struggling against it ; how absurd ! 
naming his home . 
As he continued to think on what had passed , he was still less satisfied with it or with himself . 
He had gone to lecture , and he had been lectured ; and he had let out his secret state of mind ; no , not let out , he had nothing to let out . 
He had indeed implied that he was inquiring after religious truth , but every Protestant inquires ; he would not be a Protestant if he did not . 
Of course he was seeking the truth ; it was his duty to do so ; he recollected distinctly his tutor laying down on one occasion the duty of private judgment . 
This was the very difference between Protestants and Catholics ; Catholics begin with faith , Protestants with inquiry ; and he ought to have said this to Willis . 
Much as Charles regretted home , he rejoiced to see old Oxford again . 
he said , shaking both of Charles 's hands or rather arms with all his might ; `` here we are all again ; I am just come , like you . 
Charles liked Sheffield , he liked Oxford , he was pleased to get back ; yet he had some remains of home-sickness on him , and was not quite in cue for Sheffield 's good-natured boisterousness . 
said Reding . 
`` Ah , I assure you , he has a tongue in his head , when it suits him , '' answered Charles ; `` yet I do think , '' he added musingly , `` he 's very much changed , and not for the better . '' 
`` He has turned Catholic , '' said Charles . 
Charles felt awkward ; then he said : `` I ca n't say I was surprised ; and yet I should have been less surprised at White . '' 
answered Charles : `` thus you divide the world , Sheffield ? 
he added ; `` one must respect a man who acts according to his conscience . '' 
`` Well , if there is any thing that recommends Romanism to me , '' said Charles , `` it is what you so much dislike : I 'd give twopence , if some one , whom I could trust , would say to me : ` This is true ; this is not true . ' 
`` Nonsense , '' answered Charles ; `` you should n't say such things , even in jest . '' 
`` Well , if I am , you have put me on it , '' said Reding , wishing to get away from the subject as quick as he could ; `` for you are ever talking against shams , and laughing at King Charles and Laud , Bateman , White , roodlofts , and piscinas . '' 
`` You give me the name of a very good man , whom I hardly know by sight , '' said Reding ; `` but I mean , that nobody knows what to believe , no one has a definite faith , but the Catholics and the Puseyites ; no one says , ` This is true , that is false ; ' ` this comes from the Apostles , that does not . 
''' `` I did not say a creed was every thing , '' answered Reding , `` or that a religion could not be false which had a creed ; but a religion ca n't be true which has none . '' 
`` Now there was Vincent at the end of term , after you had gone down , '' continued Charles ; `` you know I stayed up for Little-go ; and he was very civil , very civil indeed . 
`` Dr. Pusey , on the other hand , '' said Charles , `` is said always to be decisive . 
`` Then he wo n't have many followers , that 's all , '' said Charles ; `` But he has more than Dr. Pusey , '' answered Sheffield . 
`` Well , I ca n't understand it , '' said Charles ; `` he ought not ; perhaps they wo n't stay . '' 
`` Well , I honour the man who builds up , '' said Reding , `` and I despise the man who breaks down . '' 
`` I do n't like Lord Newlights , '' said Charles ; `` he seems to me to have no principle ; that is , no fixed , definite religious principle . 
Charles was puzzled . 
`` Certainly , '' he said , `` at first sight there is no creed in Scripture . 
-- No creed in Scripture , '' he said slowly , as if thinking aloud ; `` no creed in Scripture , therefore there is no creed . 
But the Athanasian Creed , '' he added quickly , `` is that in Scripture ? 
`` My dear fellow , '' said Charles , `` do you mean that he , a dignitary of the Church , would say that the Athanasian Creed was a mistake , because it represented Christianity as a revelation of doctrines or mysteries to be received on faith ? '' 
`` After all , '' said Charles , sadly , `` it 's not so much more than that other Dean , I forget his name , said at St. Mary 's before the Vacation ; it 's part of the same system . 
Well , '' he added , standing up and stretching himself , `` I am tired with the day , yet it has not been a fatiguing one either ; but London is so bustling a place . '' 
Charles did not deny the charge ; and the friends parted . 
There could not have been a lecture more unfavourable for Charles 's peace of mind than that in which he found himself this term placed ; yet , so blind are we to the future , he hailed it with great satisfaction , as if it was to bring him an answer to the perplexities into which Sheffield , Bateman , Freeborn , White , Willis , Mr. Morley , Dr. Brownside , Mr. Vincent , and the general state of Oxford , had all , in one way or other , conspired to throw him . 
It did not produce this effect on Reding . 
Whether he had expected too much , or whatever was the cause , so it was that he did but feel more vividly the sentiment of the old father in the comedy , after consulting the lawyers , `` Incertior sum multo quam ante . '' 
He saw that the profession of faith contained in the Articles was but a patchwork of bits of orthodoxy , Lutheranism , Calvinism , and Zuinglism ; and this too on no principle ; that it was the work of accident , if there be such a thing as accident , that it had come down in the particular shape in which the English Church now receives it , when it might have come down in any other shape ; that it was but a toss-up that Anglicans at this day were not Calvinists , or Presbyterians , or Lutherans , equally well as Episcopalians . 
One difficulty which Charles experienced was , to know whether , according to the Articles , divine truth was directly given us , or whether we had to seek it for ourselves from Scripture . 
Charles did not see this distinction between seeking and proving ; for how can we prove except by seeking -LRB- in Scripture -RRB- for reasons ? 
He put the question in another form , and asked if the Christian Religion allowed of private judgment ? 
Reding asked whether this meant that the Creed did not contain a distinctive view of its own , which alone was safe , but was merely a negation of error . 
The clauses , he observed , were positive , not negative . 
He could get no answer further than that the Creed taught that the doctrines of `` the Trinity '' and `` the Incarnation '' were `` necessary to salvation , '' it being apparently left uncertain what those doctrines consisted in . 
One day he asked how grievous sins were to be forgiven , which were committed after baptism , whether by faith , or not at all in this life ? 
He was answered that the Articles said nothing on the subject ; that the Romish doctrine of pardons and purgatory was false ; and that it was well to avoid both curious questions and subtle answers . 
Another day Charles asked whether Christ was present in fact , or only in effect . 
Mr. Upton answered decidedly `` in effect , '' which seemed to Reding to mean no real presence at all . 
It is difficult to give instances of this kind , without producing the impression on the reader 's mind that Charles was forward and captious in his inquiries . 
Charles naturally was full of the subject , and would have disclosed his perplexities to Sheffield , had he not had a strong anticipation that this would have been making matters worse . 
He thought Bateman , however , might be of some service , and he disburdened himself to him in the course of a country walk . 
Bateman seemed unwilling to talk on the subject ; at last he said , `` Oh , my dear Reding , you really are in an excited state of mind ; I do n't like to talk to you just now , for you will not see things in a straightforward way , and take them naturally . 
`` It really is not my way to be fussed or to fidget , '' said Charles ; `` though I own I am not so quiet as I ought to be . 
Perhaps King Charles himself ; certainly Laud , and all the great Bishops of his day , and of the next generation . 
`` The argument is a very strong one , '' said Charles ; `` I have felt it : you mean , then , I must sign on faith . '' 
asked Charles . 
Charles laughed . 
`` It is n't quite that , '' he said , `` I was but testing your advice ; however , there 's some truth in it . '' 
And he changed the subject . 
They talked a while of indifferent matters ; but on a pause Charles 's thoughts fell back again to the Articles . 
`` Tell me , Bateman , '' he said , `` as a mere matter of curiosity , how you subscribed when you took your degree . '' 
`` I understand , '' said Charles ; `` now tell me how you solved the problem . '' 
Reding thought ; then he said : `` Tell me , Bateman , would not this view of subscription to the Articles let the Unitarians into the Church ? '' 
Charles then went on to suggest that they would take the Liturgy as a Liturgy of peace too . 
Charles looked inquisitive . 
Reding took some time to think over this : `` All this , '' he said , `` proceeds on the fundamental principle that the Church of England is an integral part of that visible body , of which St. Ignatius , St. Cyprian , and the rest were Bishops ; according to the words of Scripture , ` one body , one faith . 
''' Bateman assented ; Charles proceeded : `` Then the Articles must not be considered primarily as teaching ; they have no one sense in themselves ; they are confessedly ambiguous ; they are compiled from heterogenous sources ; but all this does not matter , for all must be interpreted by the teaching of the Catholic Church . '' 
`` Well , but I know nothing of the Fathers , '' said Charles ; `` others are in the same condition ; how am I to learn practically to interpret the Articles ? '' 
Charles kept silence again : `` It is very plausible , '' he said ; he thought on . 
Presently he asked : `` Is this a received view ? '' 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` is it a tolerated view ? '' 
`` That is no answer , '' said Charles , who saw by Bateman 's manner how the truth lay . 
`` I thought so , '' said Charles , when he had made his answer : `` I know , of course , whose view you are putting before me , though I never heard it drawn out before . 
The thought came across Reding , whether perhaps , after all , what is called Evangelical Religion was not the true Christianity : its professors , he knew , were active and influential , and in past times had been much persecuted . 
So they got into conversation , talked of Willis 's step , which Freeborn called awful ; and , before Charles knew where he was , he found himself asking Freeborn what he meant by `` faith . '' 
Reding observed that of course Freeborn did not mean to say that good works were not necessary for obtaining God 's favour ; `` but if they were , how was justification by faith only ? '' 
Freeborn smiled , and said that he hoped Reding would have clearer views in a little time . 
Reding thought this view simple and clear , though it unpleasantly reminded him of Dr. Brownside . 
There was no need to mention this last consequence to Charles ; but he passed it by , wishing to try the system on its own merits . 
`` You speak of true faith , '' he said , `` as producing good works ; you say that no faith justifies but true faith , and true faith produces good works . 
`` I am in an Article lecture just now , '' said Charles , `` and Upton told us that we must make a distinction of this kind : for instance , the Duke of Wellington is Chancellor of the University , but , though he is as much Chancellor as he is Duke , still he sits in the House of Lords as Duke , not as Chancellor . 
`` I ca n't believe I understand you , '' said Charles ; `` you say , that to have faith is to seize Christ 's merits , and that we have them , if we will but seize them . 
`` I really do n't want to introduce metaphysics , '' said Charles , `` but I will adopt your own image . 
`` I did not suspect my bread , '' answered Charles . 
Freeborn was secretly annoyed that he had got into an argument , or pained , as he would express it , at the pride of Charles 's natural man , or the blindness of his carnal reason ; but there was no help for it , he must give him an answer . 
`` There are , I know , many kinds of faith , '' he said ; `` and of course you must be on your guard against mistaking false faith for true faith . 
He paused , then added : `` Now , I suppose , for practical purposes , I have described pretty well what justifying faith is . '' 
Charles hesitated : `` By describing what it is not , you mean , '' said he ; `` justifying faith , then , is , I suppose , living faith . '' 
`` Why , '' said Charles , `` if it 's not dead faith , it 's living faith . '' 
`` Then do you tell me , '' said Charles , `` what faith is , since I do not explain it correctly . 
Charles was touched by his warmth ; `` But , '' he said , `` we ought to act by reason ; and I do n't see that I have more , or so much , reason to listen to you , as to listen to the Roman Catholic , who tells me I can not possibly have that certainty of faith before believing , which on believing will be divinely given me . '' 
`` I do n't like you to talk so , '' said Reding ; `` I know very little about the real nature of Popery ; but when I was a boy , I was once , by chance , in a Roman Catholic chapel ; and I really never saw such devotion in my life -- the people all on their knees , and most earnestly attentive to what was going on . 
Freeborn said it deeply pained him to hear such sentiments , and to find that Charles was so tainted with the errors of the day ; and he began , not with much tact , to talk of the Papal Antichrist , and would have got off to prophecy , had Charles said a word to afford fuel for a discussion . 
As he kept silence , Freeborn 's zeal burnt out , and there was a break in the conversation . 
After a time , Reding ventured to begin again . 
`` If I understand you , '' he said , `` faith carries its own evidence with it . 
`` But how , '' asked Charles , `` are we to rescue those from their dangerous mistake , who think they have faith , while they have not ? 
`` Well , it does seem to me wonderful , '' said Charles , `` that there is no natural and obvious warning provided against this delusion ; wonderful that false faith should be so exactly like true faith that the event alone determines their difference from each other . 
''' `` This is coming round to the same point again , '' said Charles ; `` fruits come after ; but a man , it seems , is to take comfort in his justification before fruits come , before he knows that his faith will produce them . '' 
Charles made no answer , but said to himself , `` My good friend here certainly has not the clearest of heads ; '' then aloud , `` Well , I despair of getting at the bottom of the subject . '' 
Freeborn was not the person to let go a young man like Charles without another effort to gain him ; and in a few days he invited him to take tea at his lodgings . 
Charles went at the appointed time , through the wet and cold of a dreary November evening , and found five or six men already assembled . 
He had got into another world ; faces , manners , speeches , all were strange , and savoured neither of Eton , which was his own school , nor of Oxford itself . 
He was introduced , and found the awkwardness of a new acquaintance little relieved by the conversation which went on . 
asked Reding . 
Charles looked as if he wished to know more . 
asked Reding . 
`` It does not seem to me , '' said Charles , `` that the Pope 's admissions are greater than those made continually by certain members of our own Church , who are nevertheless accused of Popery . '' 
`` It is a sure way , at least , '' said Charles timidly , afraid he was saying too much ; but his irony was not discovered . 
You see now , perhaps , '' he said , turning to Charles , `` better than you did , what I meant by faith the other day . 
Charles had thought over their former conversation very carefully several times , and he answered , `` Why , I do n't think they do to the same extent . '' 
Charles , slightly colouring , was obliged to proceed , amid the profound silence of the whole party . 
`` Not merit , I know , '' said Charles , `` but '' -- `` We must not bring in the doctrine of de condigno or de congruo , '' said No. 2 . 
`` But surely , '' said Charles , `` it is a cruel thing to say to the unlearned and the multitude , ` Believe , and you are at once saved ; do not wait for fruits , rejoice at once , ' and neither to accompany this announcement by any clear description of what faith is , nor to secure them by previous religious training against self-deception ? '' 
''' `` On the contrary , '' said Charles , continuing his argument , `` when it is said that justification follows upon baptism , we have an intelligible something pointed out , which every one can ascertain . 
Reding had at length succeeded in throwing that dull tea-table into a state of great excitement . 
`` But you tell me faith too is not spiritual , '' said Charles . 
`` Well , '' said Charles , somewhat puzzled , `` at least you do not think it holy . '' 
`` If it is holy , '' continued Charles , `` it has something good in it ; it has some worth ; it is not filthy rags . 
`` Nothing can cause holiness but what is holy ; this is a sort of axiom , '' said Charles ; `` if the fruits are holy , faith , which is the root , is holy . '' 
`` That is what I thought , '' said Charles . 
Look here , '' he continued , taking his pocket-book out of his pocket , `` I have got his words down , as Shuffleton quoted them in the Divinity-school the other day . 
`` On the contrary , '' he added , `` it is the Romish doctrine that faith-with-love justifies . '' 
`` You mean , '' said Charles , `` that justification is given to faith with love , not to faith and love . '' 
`` asked Charles . 
asked Charles . 
said Charles , surprised . 
`` But surely Christians are under a law , '' said Charles . 
Now they got into a fresh discussion among themselves ; and as it seemed as interminable as it was uninteresting , Reding took an opportunity to wish his host a good night , and to slip away . 
He never had much leaning towards the evangelical doctrine ; and Freeborn and his friends , who knew what they were holding much better than the run of their party , satisfied him that he had not much to gain by inquiring into that doctrine further . 
When Charles got to his room , he saw a letter from home lying on his table ; and , to his alarm , it had a deep black edge . 
He tore it open . 
Alas , it announced the sudden death of his dear father . 
He had been ailing some weeks with the gout , which at length had attacked his stomach , and carried him off in a few hours . 
O my poor dear Charles , I sympathise with you keenly all that long night , and that indescribable waking in the morning , and that dreary day of travel which followed it ! 
... The funeral is over by some days ; Charles is to remain at home the remainder of the term , and does not return to Oxford till towards the end of January . 
But especially at dinner : Charles had to take a place which he had sometimes filled , but then as the deputy , and in the presence , of him whom now he succeeded . 
His father , being not much more than a middle-aged man , had been accustomed to carve himself . 
And when , at the meal of the day , Charles looked up , he had to encounter the troubled look of one , who , from her place at table , had before her eyes a still more vivid memento of their common loss : -- aliquid desideraverunt oculi . 
It was the first great grief poor Charles had now had , and he felt it to be real . 
How did the small anxieties which had of late teased him , vanish before this tangible calamity ! 
He then understood the difference between what was real and what was not . 
All the doubts , inquiries , surmises , views , which had of late haunted him on theological subjects , seemed like so many shams , which flitted before him in sun-bright hours , but had no root in his inward nature , and fell from him , like the helpless December leaves , in the hour of his affliction . 
He felt now where his heart and his life lay . 
His birth , his parentage , his education , his home , were great realities ; to these his being was united ; out of these he grew . 
He felt he must be what Providence had made him . 
He had great tangible duties , to his father 's memory , to his mother and sisters , to his position ; he felt sick of all theories , as if they had taken him in ; and he secretly resolved never more to have any thing to do with them . 
Let the world go on as it might , happen what would to others , his own place and his own path were clear . 
He would go back to Oxford , attend steadily to his books , put aside all distractions , avoid bye-paths , and do his best to acquit himself well in the schools . 
The Church of England as it was , its Articles , Bishops , preachers , professors , had sufficed for much better persons than he was ; they were good enough for him . 
He could not do better than imitate the life and death of his beloved father ; a quiet time in the country , at a distance from all excitements , a round of pious , useful work among the poor , the care of a village school , and at length the death of the righteous . 
At the moment , and for some time to come , he had special duties towards his mother ; he wished , as far as might be , to supply to her the place of him she had lost . 
Charles had left Oxford a clever , unformed youth ; he returned a man . 
The gorse was still in bloom in the latter end of the month of June , when Reding and Sheffield took up their abode in a small cottage at the upper end of this village , -- so hid with trees and girt-in with meadows , that for the stranger it was hard to find , -- there to pass their third and last long vacation , before going into the schools . 
A year and a half had passed since Charles 's great affliction , and the time had not been unprofitably spent either by himself or his friend . 
Charles had put all religious perplexities aside ; that is , he knew of course many more persons of all parties than he did before , and became better acquainted with their tenets and their characters ; but he did not dwell upon any thing which he met with , nor attempt to determine the merits or solve the difficulties of this or that question . 
He took things as they came ; and , while he gave his mind to his books , he thankfully availed himself of the religious privileges which the College system afforded him . 
Nearly a year still remained before his examination ; and , as Mrs. Reding had not yet fully arranged her plans , but was still with her daughters , passing from friend to friend , he had listened to Sheffield 's proposal , to take a tutor for the Vacation , and to find a site for their studies in the neighbourhood of Oxford . 
`` I do n't think you like Carlton so well as I do , '' said Reding to Sheffield , as they lay on the greensward with some lighter classic in their hands , waiting for dinner , and watching their friend as he approached them from his lodging . 
`` He 's too much of an Anglican for you , '' said Reding . 
`` Ah , your old failing again , '' said Reding ; `` a craving after views . 
`` And you stayed there just six weeks out of four months , Sheffield , '' answered Reding . 
Sheffield said , `` Reding and I were disputing just now whether Nicias was a party man . '' 
`` Party action , '' said Charles , `` is the exertion of influence instead of law . '' 
`` But supposing , Reding , there is no law existing in the quarter where influence exerts itself ? '' 
Charles had to explain ; `` Certainly , '' he said , `` the state did not legislate for all possible contingencies . '' 
`` Law certainly begins in influence , '' said Reding , `` for it presupposes a lawgiver ; afterwards it supersedes influence ; from that time the exertion of influence is a sign of party . '' 
`` But it is recognised by law and constitution , '' said Charles , `` as was the Dictatorship . '' 
Charles the First exerted a regal , Walpole a ministerial influence ; but influence , not law , was the operating principle in both cases . 
`` You would justify , then , '' said Charles , `` the associations or confraternities which existed , for instance , in Athens ; not , that is , if they ` took the law into their own hands , ' as the phrase goes , but if there was no law to take , or if there was no constituted authority to take it . 
`` A thought has sometimes struck me , '' said Charles , `` which falls in with what you have been saying . 
`` He is come to dine , '' said Charles ; `` just in time . '' 
For myself , '' he continued , `` I am just now an eating man , and am come to dine with you , if you will let me . 
There was a farmer near , who could lend a stable ; so the horse was led off by Charles ; and the rider , without any delay -- for the hour did not admit it -- entered the cottage to make his brief preparation for dinner . 
Charles came to his relief . 
`` Before dinner , '' he said , `` we were sporting what you will consider a great paradox , I am afraid ; that parties were good things , or rather necessary things . '' 
`` Surely , '' said Vincent , `` my good and worthy friend , the Rev. Charles Carlton , Fellow of Leicester , and sometime Ireland Essayist , is not preferring the Church of Rome to the Church of England . '' 
Charles started ; `` I knew him a little ... I have seen him several times . '' 
`` A melancholy history , anyhow , '' answered Charles ; `` most melancholy , if this is true . '' 
asked Charles . 
`` I ca n't say you satisfy me , Carlton , '' said Charles ; `` and I am happy to have the sanction of Mr. Vincent . 
`` Well , independent of this , '' answered Charles , `` I can not think religious parties defensible on the considerations which justify political . 
`` They had the sanction of their superiors , '' said Charles . 
`` You are hard on parties surely , Reding , '' said Carlton ; `` a man may individually write , preach , and publish what he believes to be the truth , without offence ; why , then , does it begin to be wrong , when he does so together with others ? '' 
`` Party tactics are a degradation of the truth , '' said Charles . 
`` Well , '' answered Charles , `` I will but say this , that a party man must be very much above par or below it . '' 
When they were left to themselves , Charles asked Carlton if he really meant to acquit of party-spirit the present party-leaders in Oxford . 
`` You must not misunderstand me , '' answered he ; `` I do not know much of them , but I know they are persons of great merit and high character , and I wish to think the best of them . 
One of them , indeed , was known to Reding also , being no other than our friend White , who was going into the schools , and during the last six months had been trying to make up for the time he had wasted in the first years of his residence . 
Charles had lost sight of him , or nearly so , since he first knew him ; and at their time of life so considerable an interval could not elapse without changes in the character for good or evil , or for both . 
Carlton and Charles , who were a good deal thrown together by Sheffield 's frequent engagements with the Chalton party , were just turning homewards in their walk one evening , when they fell in with White , who had been calling at Mr. Bolton 's in Oxford , and was returning . 
said Barry to Reding ; `` a capital tutor ; you can ill spare him . 
`` We do n't know , '' answered Charles ; `` the Principal will call up one of the Junior Fellows from the country , I believe . '' 
`` Yes , it was his forte , '' said Charles ; `` yet he never loaded his lectures ; every thing he said had a meaning , and was wanted . '' 
Charles wanted to hear something about Willis ; so he turned the current of White 's thoughts , by coming up and asking him , whether there was any truth in the report he had heard from Vincent several weeks before ; had White heard from him lately ? 
`` He is a wiser , even if he is a sadder man , '' said Charles ; `` I did not know he had so much in him . 
Charles thought a while . 
`` Vincent 's testimony , '' he said , `` is either a mere exaggeration or a confirmation of what you have told me , according as it is independent or not . '' 
Then he said to himself , `` White too has more in him than I thought ; he really has spoken about Willis very sensibly : what has come to him ? '' 
A few days after , Carlton , Sheffield , and Reding were talking together after dinner out of doors about White . 
`` How he is altered , '' said Charles , `` since I first knew him ! '' 
`` Altered for the better , '' said Charles ; `` he has now a steady sensible way of talking ; but he was not a very wise person two years ago ; he is reading , too , really hard . '' 
no indeed , '' answered Charles . 
cried Charles , `` how absurd ! '' 
`` I do n't see that at all , my dear Reding , '' said Carlton . 
Charles said that there was one thing which could not help surprising him , namely , that when White first came up , he was so strong in his advocacy of clerical celibacy . 
`` Do you really think , '' said Charles , `` that people mean so little what they say ? '' 
`` You take matters too seriously , Reding , '' answered Carlton ; `` who does not change his opinions between twenty and thirty ? 
`` But I suspect , '' said Reding , `` that the last generation , whether of fathers or of tutors , had no very exalted ideas of clerical celibacy . '' 
`` I do n't like talkers , '' continued Charles : `` I do n't think I ever shall ; I hope not . '' 
`` I know better what 's at the bottom of it , '' said Sheffield ; `` but I ca n't stay ; I must go and read ; Reding too fond of a gossip . '' 
said Charles . 
`` But I talk fast when I talk , '' answered he , `` and get through a great deal of work ; then I give over : but you prose , and muse , and sigh , and prose again . '' 
And so he left them . 
Charles slightly coloured and laughed : `` You are a man I say things to , I do n't to others , '' he made answer ; `` as to Sheffield , he fancies he has found it out of himself . '' 
`` I am ashamed of myself , '' said Charles , laughing and looking confused : `` I have made you think that I have something important to tell , but really I have nothing at all . '' 
`` Perhaps it will , '' said Charles : `` oh , I am laying no stress upon it . 
`` You are so sensible a fellow , Reding , '' said Carlton , `` it surprises me that you should take up this notion . '' 
`` It 's no new notion taken up , '' answered Charles ; `` you will smile , but I had it when a boy at school , and I have ever since fancied that I should never marry . 
Carlton put his hand on Reding 's shoulder , and gently shook him to and fro ; `` Well , it surprises me , '' he said ; then , after a pause , `` I have been accustomed to think both celibacy and marriage good in their way . 
In the Church of Rome great good , I see , comes of celibacy ; but , depend on it , my dear Reding , you are making a great blunder , if you are for introducing celibacy into the Anglican Church . '' 
`` There 's nothing against it in Prayer-book or Articles , '' said Charles . 
Charles answered , that he was not looking to the expediency or feasibility of the thing , but at what seemed to him best in itself , and what he could not help admiring . 
`` I said nothing about the celibacy of clergy , '' he observed , `` but of celibacy generally . '' 
`` Well , it seems to me as much a yoke of bondage , '' said Charles , `` to compel marriage as to compel celibacy , and that is what you are really driving at . 
`` Well , excuse me , '' said Charles , `` if I have said any thing very foolish ; you do n't suppose I argue on such subjects with others . '' 
They had by this time strolled as far as Carlton 's lodging , where the books happened to be on which Charles was at that time more immediately employed ; and they took two or three turns under some fine beeches which stood in front of the house , before entering it . 
`` Tell me , Reding , '' said Carlton , `` for really I do n't understand , what are your reasons for admiring what , in truth , is simply an unnatural state . '' 
`` Do n't let us talk more , my dear Carlton , '' answered Reding ; `` I shall go on making a fool of myself . 
Carlton , too , felt strongly upon what seemed at first sight a very secondary question , or he would have let it alone , as Charles asked him . 
`` No ; as we are on the subject , let me get at your view , '' said he : `` it was said in the beginning , ` Increase and multiply ; ' therefore celibacy is unnatural . '' 
`` Supernatural , '' said Charles , smiling . 
`` I really think that our divines , or at least some of them , are on my side here , '' said Charles -- `` Jeremy Taylor , I believe . '' 
`` It seems to me , '' said Charles , `` that Christianity , being perfection of nature , is both like it and unlike it ; -- like it , where it is the same or as much as nature ; unlike it , where it is as much and more . 
-- `` Well , I wo n't go to criticism , '' said Charles : `` take the text , ` in sin hath my mother conceived me . ' 
`` My dear Reding , '' said Carlton , astonished , `` you are running into Gnosticism . '' 
`` Not knowingly or willingly , '' answered Charles ; `` but understand what I mean . 
`` And it is what I mean by supernatural , '' answered Reding , getting a little too earnest . 
Charles was puzzled . 
It was a way , he said , towards perfection ; but he thought that perfection came after death , not here . 
`` Well , Reding , '' answered Carlton `` you make Christianity a very different religion from what our Church considers it , I really think ; '' and he paused awhile . 
`` Do n't you think , then , '' said Charles , `` that we should grieve for the sins into which we are daily betrayed , and for the more serious offences which from time to time we may have committed ? '' 
`` Really , '' said Charles thoughtfully . 
`` Well , somehow I can not master this idea , '' said Charles ; `` I think most serious persons , even for a little sin , would go on fidgeting themselves , and not suppose they gained pardon directly they asked for it . '' 
`` That is , '' said Charles , `` who do n't at once feel peace , assurance , and comfort ; who do n't feel the perfect joy of the Gospel . '' 
`` But tell me , Carlton , '' said Reding ; `` is , or is not , their not forgiving themselves , their sorrow and trouble , pleasing to God ? '' 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` I certainly fancied that fasting , abstinence , labours , celibacy , might be taken as a make-up for sin . 
`` But , my dear Reding , '' said Carlton , `` let me bring you back to what you said originally , and to my answer to you , which what you now say only makes more apposite . 
`` Perhaps our highest perfection here is penance , '' said Charles ; `` but I do n't know ; I do n't profess to have clear ideas upon the subject . 
They did , in consequence , pass to other subjects connected with Charles 's reading ; then they entered the house , and set-to upon Polybius : but it could not be denied that for the rest of the day Carlton 's manner was not quite his own , as if something had annoyed him . 
Here was Charles with his thoughts turned away from religious controversy for two years , yet with his religious views progressing , unknown to himself , the whole time . 
It could not have been otherwise , if he was to live a religious life at all . 
If he was to worship and obey his Creator , intellectual acts , conclusions , and judgments , must accompany that worship and obedience . 
He might not realise his own belief till questions had been put to him ; but then a single discussion with a friend , such as the above with Carlton , would bring out what he really did hold to his own apprehension , -- would ascertain for him the limits of each opinion as he held it , and the inter-relations of opinion with opinion . 
No wonder that all this annoyed Carlton , though he no more than Charles perceived that all this Catholicism did in fact lie hid under his professions ; but he felt in what Reding put out the presence of something , as he expressed it , `` very unlike the Church of England ; '' something new and unpleasant to him , and withal something which had a body in it , which had momentum , which could not be passed over as a vague sudden sound or transitory cloud , but which had much behind it which made itself felt , which struck heavily . 
And here we see what is meant when a person says that the Catholic system comes home to his mind , fulfils his ideas of religion , satisfies his sympathies , and the like ; and thereupon becomes a Catholic . 
Such a person is often said to go by private judgment , to be choosing his religion by his own standard of what a religion ought to be . 
Charles , for instance , felt a difficulty in determining how and when the sins of a Christian are forgiven ; he had a great notion that celibacy was better than married life . 
Here was Charles , busy in Aristotle and Euripides , Thucydides and Lucretius , yet all the while growing towards the Church , `` to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ . '' 
His mother had said to him that he could not escape his destiny ; it was true , though it was to be fulfilled in a way which she , affectionate heart , could not compass , did not dream of . 
He could not escape the destiny of being one of the elect of God ; he could not escape that destiny which the grace of his Redeemer had stamped on his soul in baptism , which his good angel had seen written there , and had done his zealous part to keep inviolate and bright , which his own co-operation with the influences of Heaven had confirmed and secured . 
while Charles had been growing one way , Sheffield had been growing another ; and what that growth had been , will appear from a conversation which took place between the two friends , and which shall be related in the following chapter . 
`` That 's no mark of party surely , '' answered Charles . 
Charles did not see how obeying in so plain a matter the clear direction of the Prayer-book could be a party act . 
`` The prima facie view of the matter , '' said Charles , `` is that they who do but follow what the Prayer-book enjoins , are of all people farthest from being a party . '' 
`` I should say so too , in one sense , '' said Charles ; `` that is , I should hope that numbers of persons , for instance the unlearned , who were in Arian communities , spoke Arian language , and yet did not mean it . 
''' `` One swallow does not make a spring , '' said Charles . 
`` Of course , '' said Reding , `` there has always been a heterodox school in our Church -- I know that well enough -- but it never has been powerful . 
`` So little was known about history , '' said Charles , `` this is not surprising . 
''' `` Well , perhaps he meant , '' said Charles , `` that learning died away , which was the case . 
''' Charles was silent , and hardly knew what reply to make . 
`` My dear Sheffield , '' said Charles , `` you have fallen in with a particular set or party of men yourself ; very respectable good men , I do n't doubt , but no fair specimens of the whole Church . '' 
`` Still , '' said Charles , `` I know perfectly well , that there was a controversy at the end of last century between Bishop Horsley and others , in which he brought out distinctly one part at least of the Athanasian doctrine . '' 
`` I ca n't think so badly of our present divines , '' said Charles ; `` I know that in this very place there are various orthodox writers , whom no one would call party men . '' 
`` It 's easy to bring instances , '' said Charles , `` when you have all your own way ; what you say is evidently all an exparte statement . '' 
`` Why , '' said Charles , `` the practice of the Church can not make black white ; or , if a sentence means yes , make it mean no . 
said Charles , `` what stuff ! 
''' Charles was not pleased with the subject , on various accounts . 
He did not like what seemed to him an attack of Sheffield 's upon the church of England ; and , besides , he began to feel uncomfortable misgivings and doubts whether that attack was not well founded , to which he did not like to be exposed . 
Then , seeing Charles looked rather hurt , he added , `` I am not speaking of any particular clergyman here or there , but of the great majority of them . 
`` I do n't agree with you at all , '' said Charles ; `` you say a great deal more than you have a warrant to do , and draw sweeping conclusions from slender premisses . 
`` Reding , '' answered Sheffield , `` I speak what I think , and ever will do so . 
`` O my dear Sheffield , '' cried Charles in distress , `` think what you are saying ; you do n't mean what you say . 
Reding had for near two years put aside his doubts about the Articles ; but it was like putting off the payment of a bill -- a respite , not a deliverance . 
Charles was still silent , and went on plucking and chewing leaves from the shrubs and bushes through which their path winded . 
`` Well , perhaps I was not up to the subject , '' answered Charles . 
`` But my fidget is , '' said Charles , `` lest my difficulties should return , and I should not be able to remove them . '' 
`` I know , '' said Reding , `` I ca n't make a religion , nor can I perhaps find one better than my own . 
`` All this is very good , '' answered Charles ; `` but what is very expedient , still may be very impossible . 
Charles said , that somehow he did not like this mode of arguing ; it seemed dangerous ; he did not see whither it went , where it ended . 
`` I do n't know Pope Pius 's Creed , '' said Charles ; `` I know very little about the state of the case , certainly . 
`` It depends , '' answered Charles slowly , `` on this , -- on what authority they came to me . '' 
`` You mean , I suppose , '' said Charles , `` that I must consider our Church infallible . '' 
Charles smiled ; then he looked grave ; he stood still , and his eyes fell . 
`` If I am to make a Church infallible , '' he said , `` if I must give up private judgment , if I must act on faith , there is a Church which has a greater claim on me than the Church of England . '' 
`` My dear Reding , '' said Carlton with some emotion , `` where did you get these notions ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' answered Charles ; `` somebody has said that they were in the air . 
`` Well , they seem to me , '' said Reding , `` sometimes inconsistent with themselves , sometimes with the Prayer-book ; so that I am suspicious of them ; I do n't know what I am signing when I sign , yet I ought to sign ex animo . 
`` For example , '' said Charles , `` they distinctly receive the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith only , which the Prayer-book virtually opposes in every one of its Offices . 
`` On the other hand , it has struck me , '' continued Charles , `` that the Church of Rome is undeniably consistent in her formularies ; this is the very charge some of our writers make upon her , that she is so systematic . 
Carlton did not wish to interrupt him , thinking it best to hear his whole difficulty ; so Charles proceeded : `` When a system is consistent , at least it does not condemn itself . 
Charles stopped ; presently he continued : `` This too has struck me ; that either there is no prophet of the truth on earth , or the Church of Rome is that prophet . 
He fetched a deep sharp sigh , as if he had got a load off him . 
Charles thought over this ; then he said , `` Perhaps the case is as you say that I ought to know the matter of fact more exactly before attempting to form a judgment on these subjects ; but , my dear Carlton , I protest to you , and you may think with what distress I say it , that if the Church of Rome is as ambiguous as our own Church , I shall be in the way to become a sceptic , on the very ground that I shall have no competent authority to tell me what to believe . 
`` You are always kind and considerate , '' said Charles ; `` but after all , -- I wish I could make you see it , -- you have not a word to say by way of meeting my original difficulty of subscription . 
While others might be steaming from London to Bombay or the Havannah , and months in the retrospect might look like years , with Reding and Sheffield the week had scarcely begun when it was found to be ending ; and when October came , and they saw their Oxford friends again , at first they thought they had a good deal to say to them , but when they tried , they found it did but concern minute points of their own reading and personal matters ; and they were reduced to silence , with the wish to speak . 
Charles looked around him , and rose to depart as a `` conviva satur . '' 
He was hurrying to the world , who had been up on the mount ; he had lived without jars , without distractions , without disappointments ; and he was now to take them as his portion . 
For he was but a child of Adam ; Horsley had been but a respite ; and he had vividly brought before his memory the sad reverse which came upon him two years before -- what a happy summer -- what a forlorn autumn . 
But , what was a real trouble to Charles , it got clearer and clearer to his apprehension , that his intimacy with Sheffield was not quite what it had been . 
Charles 's characteristic , perhaps above any thing else , was an habitual sense of the Divine Presence ; a sense which , of course , did not ensure uninterrupted conformity of thought and deed to itself , but still there it was -- the pillar of the cloud before him and guiding him . 
He felt himself to be God 's creature , and responsible to Him -- God 's possession , not his own . 
But it was far different with Charles ; he had felt interest in religious questions for their own sake ; and when he had deprived himself of the pursuit of them , it had been a self-denial . 
Now then , when they seemed forced on him again , Sheffield could not help him , where he most wanted the assistance of a friend . 
When Charles attended the tea-party at Freeborn 's , he was on his trial ; he was introduced not only into a school , but into an inquisition ; and since he did not promise to be a subject for spiritual impression , he was forthwith a subject for spiritual censure . 
He became a marked man in the circles of Capel Hall and St. Mark 's . 
What effect it had upon Charles , or whether any , must be determined by the sequel ; her it will suffice to relate interviews which took place between him and the Principal and Vice-Principal of his College in consequence of it . 
When Reding presented himself to the Vice-Principal , the Rev. Joshua Jennings , to ask for leave to reside in lodgings for the two terms previous to his examination , he was met with a courteous but decisive refusal . 
The Vice-Principal seemed to expect him to ask the reason of his proceeding ; as Charles , in his confusion , did not seem likely to do so , he condescended to open the conversation . 
It was not meant as any reflection , he said , on Mr. Reding 's moral conduct ; he had ever been a well-conducted young man , and had quite borne out the character with which he had come from school ; but there were duties to be observed towards the community , and its undergraduate portion must be protected from the contagion of principles which were too rife at the moment . 
Charles was , if possible , still more surprised , and suggested that there must be some misunderstanding , if he had been represented to the Vice-Principal as connected with any so-called party in the place . 
Charles did not know how to answer his question ; and on his silence it was repeated . 
At length he said that really he was not in a condition to speak against any one ; and if he spoke of a so-called party , it was that he might not seem disrespectful to some who might be better men than himself . 
Charles paused to think ; at last he said : `` Persons who band together on their own authority for the maintenance of views of their own . '' 
Charles assented . 
thought Charles ; `` what can he mean ? 
Meanwhile Jennings kept steadily regarding him , and Charles got more and more confused . 
`` I think , '' he said , making a desperate snatch at authoritative words , `` I think that the Articles ` contain a godly and wholesome doctrine , and necessary for these times . 
He proceeded , after a pause : `` What is justification ? '' 
`` Justification , '' said Charles , repeating the word , and thinking ; then , in the words of the Article , he went on : `` We are accounted righteous before God , but only for the merit of our Lord Jesus Christ , by faith , and not by our own works and deservings . '' 
This was very hard , for it was one of Charles 's puzzles what justification was in itself , for the Articles do not define it any more than faith . 
He answered to this effect , that the Articles did not define it . 
`` Yes , '' answered Charles . 
Charles was silent ; Jennings tried to force his decision upon him . 
At length Charles said that `` only some General Councils were admitted as infallible by the Romanists , and he believed that Bellarmine gave a list of General Councils which had erred . '' 
He returned to his former subject . 
he asked . 
That was more than Charles could tell ; he wished very much to know the right sense of them ; so he beat about for the received answer . 
`` In the sense of Scripture , '' he said . 
Charles assented for peace-sake . 
But his concession availed not ; the Vice-Principal pursued his advantage : `` They must not interpret each other , Mr. Reding , else you revolve in a circle . 
`` I wish to take them , '' Reding answered , `` in the general and received sense of our Church , as all our divines and present Bishops take them . '' 
Charles could not help being candid , and said in a lower tone , as if words of course , `` that is , on faith . '' 
Charles gave two or three of the usual passages with such success , that the Vice-Principal was secretly beginning to relent , when unhappily , on asking a last question as a matter of course , he received an answer which confirmed all his former surmises , and sealed the speaker 's fate . 
Charles said that he did not recollect that it had expressed any opinion on the subject . 
Jennings bade him think again ; Charles thought in vain . 
Charles , believing it to be an open point , thought he should be safe in imitating `` our Church 's '' moderation . 
`` There are different opinions on the subject , '' he said : `` some persons think they intercede for us , others that they do not . 
Charles began to be frightened . 
`` The Romish doctrine , '' said Charles , -- `` the Romish doctrine concerning purgatory , pardons , worshipping and adoration as well of images as of relics , and also invocation of Saints '' -- `` Stop there , '' said the Vice-Principal ; `` read those words again . '' 
Charles was puzzled , thought he had made some blunder , could not find it , and was silent . 
Charles at length said that he thought Mr. Jennings had spoken about intercession . 
`` And this , '' said Charles , timidly , `` speaks of invocation . '' 
he said ; `` give me the book . '' 
He slowly read the Article , and then cast a cautious eye over the page before and after . 
He began again . 
So it was a thing settled : Charles was to be sent home , -- an endurable banishment . 
Before he went down , he paid a visit of form to the old Principal -- a worthy man in his generation , who before now had raised a congregation in a wild part of the country , had instructed the ignorant and fed the poor ; but now in the end of his days , falling on evil times , was permitted , for inscrutable purposes , to give evidence of that evil puritanical leaven which was a secret element of his religion . 
He had been kind to Charles hitherto , which made his altered manner more distressing to him . 
`` We had hoped , '' he said , `` Mr. Reding , that so good a young man as you once were , would have gained a place on some foundation , and been settled here , and been a useful man in his generation , sir ; and a column , a buttress of the Church of England , sir . 
Charles said he had not yet been into the schools . 
Charles was shocked at the language used about him . 
`` Really , sir , '' he said , `` if you knew me better , you would feel that I am likely neither to receive or do harm by remaining here between this and Easter . '' 
Charles really had not a word to say ; he did not know himself in so novel a position . 
`` I can not conceive , sir , '' he said at last , `` why I should be unfit company for the gentlemen of the College . '' 
Dr. Bluett 's jaw dropped , and his eyes assumed a hollow aspect . 
`` You will corrupt their minds , sir , '' he said , -- `` you will corrupt their minds . '' 
Then he added in a sepulchral tone , which came from the very depth of his inside , `` You will introduce them , sir , to some subtle Jesuit -- to some subtle Jesuit , Mr. Reding . '' 
Mrs. Reding was by this time settled in the neighbourhood of old friends in Devonshire ; and there Charles spent the winter and early spring with her and his three sisters , the eldest of whom was two years older than himself . 
`` Come , shut your dull books , Charles , '' said Caroline , the youngest , a girl of fourteen ; `` make way for the tea ; I am sure you have read enough . 
`` My dear Cary , you would not be much the wiser , if I did , '' answered Charles ; `` it is Greek history . '' 
`` Capital , '' said Charles ; `` well , I am reading about Pelopidas , who was he ? '' 
said Charles . 
`` She has , ma'am , '' said Charles , `` what Mr. Jennings would call a ` very inaccurate mind . 
asked Charles . 
`` But surely , '' said Charles , `` a memoria technica makes you recollect a great many dates which you otherwise could not ? '' 
`` That 's because you have very few dates to get up , '' said Charles ; `` but common writing is a memoria technica . '' 
said Charles ; `` they are more musical , but as arbitrary . 
`` My dear mother , '' said Charles , coming round to the fire , `` I do n't wish to be paradoxical ; it 's only a generalisation . '' 
`` I am in a dilemma , '' said Charles , as he seated himself on a little stool at his mother 's feet ; `` for Cary calls me stupid if I am silent , and you call me paradoxical , if I speak . '' 
`` Good sense , '' said his mother , `` is the golden mean . '' 
said Charles . 
`` Well done , '' said Charles ; `` it is small change for every hour . '' 
''' `` No wonder you have so little of it , poor dear child , '' said Charles ; `` no bank could stand such a run . '' 
`` Like the great ocean , '' said Charles , `` which receives the rivers , yet is not full . '' 
`` In the Preacher , '' said Charles , and he continued the quotation ; ``` All things are full of labour , man can not utter it ; the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing . 
''' His mother sighed ; `` Take my cup , my love , '' she said ; `` no more . '' 
`` I know why Charles is so fond of the Preacher , '' said Mary ; `` it 's because he 's tired of reading ; ` much study is a weariness to the flesh : ' I wish we could help you , dear Charles . '' 
`` My dear boy , I really think you read too much , '' said his mother ; `` only think how many hours you have been at it to-day . 
`` Just the finest time of the year , '' said his mother ; `` it 's universally allowed ; all painters say that the autumn is the season to see a landscape in . '' 
`` It makes me melancholy , '' said Charles . 
asked his mother . 
`` Charles always says so , '' said Mary ; `` he thinks nothing of the rich hues into which the sober green changes ; he likes the dull uniform of summer . '' 
`` No , it is not that , '' said Charles ; `` I never saw any thing so gorgeous as Magdalen Water-walk , for instance , in October ; it is quite wonderful , the variety of colours . 
`` No , no , '' said Charles , `` we always go by association ; else why not admire raw beef , or a toad , or some other reptiles , which are as beautiful and bright as tulips or cherries , yet revolting , because we consider what they are , not how they look ? '' 
said his mother , looking up from her work ; `` my dear Charles , you are not serious in comparing cherries to raw beef or to toads . '' 
`` No , my dear mother , '' answered Charles , laughing , `` no , I only say that they look like them , not are like them . '' 
`` A toad look like a cherry , Charles ! '' 
`` Oh , my dear mother , '' he answered , `` I ca n't explain ; I really have said nothing out of the way . 
`` It is impossible , '' said Charles ; `` it is the sick season , and the deathbed of Nature . 
`` This is a strained unnatural view , Charles , '' said Mary ; `` shake yourself , and you will come to a better mind . 
Charles was for a moment posed ; then he said , `` Yes , but there was no autumn in Eden ; suns rose and set in Paradise , but the leaves were always green , and did not wither . 
''' `` So , my dearest Charles , '' said Mrs. Reding , `` you do n't go out walking these fine days because there was no autumn in the garden of Eden ? '' 
`` Oh , '' said Charles , laughing , `` it is cruel to bring me so to book . 
`` I am glad we have you here , my dear , '' said his mother , `` for we can force you out now and then ; at College I suspect you never walk at all . '' 
`` It 's only for a time , ma'am , '' said Charles ; `` when my examination is over , I will take as long walks as I did with Edward Gandy that winter after I left school . '' 
`` Ah , how merry you were then , Charles , '' said Mary ; `` so happy with the thoughts of Oxford before you ! '' 
`` True , my love , '' answered Mrs. Reding ; `` Charles is a dear good fellow , I know . 
How glad we all shall be to have him ordained , and settled in a curacy ! '' 
Charles sighed . 
`` Come , Mary , '' he said , `` give us some music , now the urn has gone away . 
''' `` Oh , Charles , you do give such melancholy names to things ! '' 
`` The other day , '' said Eliza , `` we had a most beautiful scent wafted across the road as we were walking , and he called it ` The ghost of the past ; ' and he says that the sound of the Eolian harp is ` remorseful . 
''' `` Now , you 'd think all that very pretty , '' said Charles , `` if you saw it in a book of poems ; but you call it melancholy when I say it . '' 
`` Well , '' said Mary , `` I play to you , Charles , on this one condition , that you let me give you some morning a serious lecture on that melancholy of yours , which , I assure you , is growing on you . '' 
Charles 's perplexities rapidly took a definite form on his coming into Devonshire . 
The very fact of his being at home , and not at Oxford where he ought to have been , brought them before his mind ; and the near prospect of his examination and degree justified the consideration of them . 
No addition indeed was made to their substance , as already described ; but they were no longer vague and indistinct , but thoroughly apprehended by him ; nor did he make up his mind that they were unsurmountable , but he saw clearly what it was that had to be surmounted . 
The particular form of argument into which they happened to fall , was determined by the circumstances in which he found himself at the time , and was this , viz. : how he could subscribe the Articles ex animo , without faith , more or less , in his Church as the imponent ; and next , how he could have faith in her , her history and present condition being what they were . 
The fact of these difficulties was a great source of distress to Charles . 
It was aggravated by the circumstance that he had no one to talk to , or to sympathise with him under them . 
And it was completed by the necessity of carrying about with him a secret which he dared not tell to others , yet which he foreboded must be told one day . 
All this was the secret of that depression of spirits which his sisters had observed in him . 
He was one day sitting thoughtfully over the fire with a book in his hand , when Mary entered . 
`` Sermons in stones , and good in every thing , '' answered Charles . 
`` Not so , '' said he , `` but to the good Duke Charles , who was banished to the green forest . '' 
My dear Charles , '' she continued , `` I hope the tittle-tattle that drove you here , does not still dwell on your mind . '' 
`` Well , my dearest Charles , you must not brood over it , '' said Mary , `` as I fear you are doing . '' 
`` I do n't see where it is to end , '' said Charles ; `` the Principal expressly said that my prospects at the University were knocked up . 
`` I have been so very careful , Mary , '' said Charles ; `` I have never been to the evening parties , or to the sermons which are talked about in the University . 
`` Depend on it , '' said his sister , `` you will think nothing of it whatever this time next year . 
`` And then my dear mother too , '' he continued ; `` what she will think of it when it comes to her ears ; and come it must . '' 
`` No , it ca n't be so , '' said Charles , seriously . 
`` These things do n't clear off in that way , '' said he ; `` it is no summer-cloud ; it may turn to rain , for what they know . '' 
Mary looked at him with some surprise . 
`` I mean , '' he said , `` that I have no confidence that they will let me take my degree , any more than reside there . '' 
`` My sweet Mary , '' he said , affectionately taking her hand , `` my only real confidant and comfort , I would tell you something more , if you could bear it . '' 
`` Charles , '' she said , withdrawing her hand , `` any pain is less than to see you thus . 
Charles put his feet on the fender , and looked down . 
`` I ca n't tell you , '' he said , at length , with vehemence ; then , seeing by her face how much he was distressing her , he said , half laughing , as if to turn the edge of his words , `` My dear Mary , when people bear witness against one , one ca n't help fearing that there is , perhaps , something to bear witness against . '' 
`` Impossible , Charles ! 
Charles covered his face with his hands , and at length said : `` It 's no good ; you ca n't assist me here ; I only pain you . 
`` My dearest Charles , '' said Mary , tenderly , `` come , I will bear any thing , and not be annoyed . 
`` Why , '' he answered , `` when a number of people tell me that Oxford is not my place , not my position , perhaps they are right ; perhaps it is n't . '' 
`` Now , my dear Charles , speak out ; do n't drop hints ; let me know ; '' and she sat down with a look of great anxiety . 
`` Well , '' he said , making an effort ; `` yet I do n't know where to begin ; but many things have happened to me , in various ways , to shew me that I have not a place , a position , a home , that I am not made for , that I am a stranger in , the Church of England . '' 
There was a dreadful pause ; Mary turned very pale ; then , darting at a conclusion with precipitancy , she said quickly : `` You mean to say , you are going to join the Church of Rome , Charles . '' 
`` No , '' he said ; `` it is not so . 
`` I ca n't go through things in order , '' he said ; `` but wherever I go , whomever I talk with , I feel to be another sort of person from what I am . 
`` Oh , Charles , '' said Mary , `` how changed you are ! '' 
''' Charles was touched when he was reminded of what he had been three years before ; he said : `` I suppose it is coming out of shadows into realities . '' 
`` I wish I could bring home to you , '' said Charles , `` the number of intimations , as it were , which have been given me of my uncongeniality , as it may be called , with things as they are . 
Mary laughed : `` Well , my dear Charles , '' she said , `` I did not think you had seen so much of Bishops , Deans , Professors , and Heads of houses at St. Saviour 's ; you have kept good company . '' 
`` I have my eyes about me , '' said Charles , `` and have had quite opportunities enough ; I ca n't go into particulars . '' 
He thought of White . 
`` I said nothing about the Church of Rome , '' said Charles ; `` why do you bring in the Church of Rome ? 
`` But I was speaking of Carlton , '' said Charles ; `` do you know , good fellow as he is , -- and I love , admire , and respect him exceedingly , -- he actually laid it down almost as an axiom , that a clergyman of the English Church ought to marry . 
Poor Charles was so serious , and the proposition which he related was so monstrous , that Mary , in spite of her real distress , could not help laughing out . 
`` Do n't talk in that way , Mary , '' said Charles ; `` I ca n't bear a joke just now . 
When you take up a thing , Charles , I know well you do n't lay it down . 
said he sorrowfully . 
Dear Charles , do n't mistake me , and do n't deceive yourself . 
We have hunted high and low , and never guessed you were helping Charles at his books . '' 
`` I can go no where for sympathy , '' thought Charles ; `` dear Mary does not understand me more than others . 
Charles 's state of mind was a matter of simple astonishment to her . 
At first it quite frightened and shocked her ; it was as if Charles had lost his identity , and had turned out some one else . 
And that , of all persons in the world , her brother , her own Charles , with whom she had been one heart and soul all their lives -- one so cheerful , so religious , so good , so sensible , so cautious , that he should be the first specimen that crossed her path of the new opinions , -- it bewildered her . 
And where had he got his notions ? 
she could not call them notions ; he had nothing to say for himself . 
It was an infatuation ; he , so clever , so sharp-sighted , could say nothing better in defence of himself than that Mrs. Bishop of Pembroke was too pretty , and that old Dr. Stock sat upon a cushion . 
How it was he could be so insensible to the blessings he gained from his Church and had enjoyed all his life ! 
What could he need ? 
Then , she had anticipated how pleasant it would be when Charles was himself a clergyman , and she should hear him preach ; when there would be one whom she would have a right to ask questions and to consult , whenever she wished . 
This prospect was at an end ; she could no longer trust him ; he had given a shake to her confidence which it never could recover ; it was gone for ever . 
They were all of them women but he ; he was their only stay , now that her father had been taken away . 
Charles was more attentive to his mother ; he no more brought his books into the drawing-room , but gave himself to her company . 
He read to them , but he had little to talk about ; and Eliza and Caroline both wished his stupid examination past and over , that he might be restored to his natural liveliness . 
Charles had not told her the real cause of his spending the winter at home , thinking it would be a needless vexation to her ; much less did he contemplate harassing her with the recital of his own religious difficulties , which were not of a nature to be appreciable by a woman , and issued in no definite result . 
To his sister he did attempt an explanation of his former conversation , with a view of softening the extreme misgivings which it had created in her mind . 
She received it thankfully , and professed to be relieved by it ; but the blow was struck , the suspicion was lodged deep in her mind , -- he was still Charles , dear to her as ever , but she never could rid herself of the anticipation which on that occasion she had expressed . 
One morning he was told that a gentleman had asked for him , and been shewn into the dining-room . 
Descending , he saw the tall slender figure of Bateman , now a clergyman , and lately appointed curate of a neighbouring parish . 
Charles had not seen him for a year and a half , and shook hands with him very warmly , complimenting him on his white neckcloth , which somehow , he said , altered him more than he could have expected . 
If so , the trial was on the point of beginning ; for Charles said instantly that he must come and see his mother , and of course meant to dine with them ; -- the sky was clear , and there was an excellent footpath between Boughton and Melford . 
Bateman could not do this , but he would have the greatest pleasure in being introduced to Mrs. Reding ; so he stumbled after Charles into the drawing-room , and was soon conversing with her and the young ladies . 
`` It is Hart Hill , '' said Charles ; `` there 's a Roman camp atop of it . '' 
`` Fifty were intended , '' said Charles . 
For , though the Reformation was a great blessing , '' -LRB- a glance at Charles , -RRB- `` yet we must not , in justice , forget what was done by English Churchmen before it . '' 
`` My mother has but lately come here , like yourself , '' said Charles : `` yes , there is some ; Barton Church , you know , '' appealing to Mary . 
`` They are to put in seats , '' said Charles , `` and of a very good pattern . '' 
Charles broke it by asking if Bateman intended to do any thing in the improvement-line at Melford . 
It was with some malicious feeling , in consequence of his attack on clergymen of the past age , that Charles pressed his visitor to give an account of his own reforms . 
`` Particularly behind , '' said Charles ; `` it is quite unshapely . '' 
Mary had difficulty to keep from smiling ; Charles laughed out . 
`` Impossible , Bateman , '' he said ; `` you do n't mean you wear your tailed French coat over your long straight cassock reaching to your ankles ? '' 
''' `` I 'll be bound they do , '' said Charles . 
`` It 's a broad hint , certainly , '' said Charles . 
`` One thing only is wanting besides , '' said Charles , smiling and looking amiable , lest he should be saying too much ; `` since you are full tall , you must kneel when you preach , Bateman , else you will undo your own alterations . '' 
`` With these precautions , '' said Charles , `` I really think you might have ventured on your surplice in the pulpit every Sunday . 
asked Charles . 
`` Well , '' said Charles to himself , `` I 'll back the old parsons against the young ones any day , if this is to be their cut . '' 
Bateman accordingly , having been thus trotted out for the amusement of the ladies , was now led off again , and was soon in the aforesaid terrace-walk , pacing up and down in earnest conversation with Charles . 
`` Reding , my good fellow , '' said he , `` what is the meaning of this report concerning you , which is every where about ? '' 
`` I have not heard it , '' said Charles abruptly . 
asked Charles coolly . 
`` So , '' thought Charles , `` you are bringing your witness against me , as well as the rest . '' 
`` Well but , my good Reding , '' said Bateman , `` why are you silent ? 
said Charles . 
`` Come , be serious for a moment , Reding , '' said Bateman , `` do be serious . 
`` Oh , to be sure , '' said Charles , `` contradict it by all means , contradict it entirely . '' 
`` You see , '' he said , `` it would be such a wonderful blindness , it would be so utterly inexcusable , in a person like yourself , who had known what the Church of England was ; not a Dissenter , not an unlettered layman ; but one who had been at Oxford , who had come across so many excellent men , who had seen what the Church of England could be , her grave beauty , her orderly and decent activity ; who had seen churches decorated as they should be , with candlesticks , ciboriums , fald-stools , lecterns , antependiums , piscinas , roodlofts , and sedilia ; who , in fact , had seen the Church-system carried out , and could desiderate nothing ; -- tell me , my dear good Reding , '' taking hold of his button-hole , `` what is it you want ? 
`` That you would take yourself off , '' Charles would have said , had he spoken his mind ; he merely said , however , that really he desiderated nothing but to be believed when he said that he had no intention of leaving his own Church . 
`` What , I suppose he told people right and left , '' said Reding . 
`` I am much obliged to him , '' said Charles . 
`` I do n't like to seem to drive you away , '' said Charles , `` but really you must be going , if you want to get home before nightfall . 
Much as Charles loved and prized the company of his mother and sisters , he was not sorry to have gentlemen 's society ; so he accepted with pleasure an invitation which Bateman sent him to dine with him at Melford . 
Reding said , that all these adjuncts of worship , whether music or architecture , were national ; they were the mode in which religious feeling shewed itself in particular times and places . 
He did not mean to say , that the outward expression of religion in a country might not be guided , but it could not be forced ; that it was as preposterous to make people worship in one 's own way , as to be merry in one 's own way . 
`` The Greeks , '' he said , `` cut the hair in grief , the Romans let it grow ; the Orientals veiled their heads in worship , the Greeks uncovered them ; Christians take off their hats in a church , Mahomedans their shoes ; a long veil is a sign of modesty in Europe , of immodesty in Asia . 
`` Far from it , '' answered Charles ; `` but let those who confine their music to Gregorians , put up crucifixes in the highways . 
`` Or of different ideas , '' said Charles , `` the cassock Catholic , the coat Protestant . '' 
`` This is not very edifying doctrine for Reding , '' thought Bateman . 
`` I do n't quite understand that language , '' said Reding ; `` I see it is used in various publications . 
thought Charles ; `` why it 's putting the controversy into a nut-shell . '' 
asked Charles . 
`` A good remark , '' thought Charles ; `` what a pity that Bateman , with so much sense , should have so little common sense ! '' 
`` You but try , Bateman , '' said Reding , `` to make a bass play quadrilles , and you will see what is meant by taxing an instrument . '' 
`` Wonderful 's the right word , '' answered Reding ; `` it is very wonderful . 
`` I have always understood , as you say , '' answered Charles ; `` modern music did not come into existence till after the powers of the violin became known . 
`` It is curious enough , '' said Reding , `` one thing which I have been accustomed to say , quite falls in with this view of yours . 
`` Much as I like modern music , '' said Charles , `` I ca n't quite go the length to which your doctrine would lead me . 
`` It 's what is always used , I believe , '' said Charles . 
asked Charles . 
said Charles . 
`` A good seven miles from you , '' said Charles . 
`` That is not like a transition , except a physical one , '' observed Reding . 
`` Very awful , these defections , '' said Bateman ; `` but very satisfactory ; a melancholy satisfaction , '' with a look at Charles , `` that the victims of the delusion should be at length recovered . '' 
`` Well , I do n't know how to think it , '' said Charles ; `` the hold our Church has on the mind is so powerful ; it is such a wrench to leave it , I can not fancy any party-tie standing against it . 
`` Did you hear the report -- I did not think much of it myself , '' said Reding -- `` that Smith was moving ? '' 
Charles accepted the offer ; and Bateman was soon deserted by his two guests . 
Campbell put Charles down at about half-way between Melford and his home . 
Charles , to his surprise , saw distinctly a man kneeling on the little mound out of which the Cross grew ; nay , heard him , for his shoulders were bare , and he was using the discipline upon them , while he repeated what appeared to be some form of devotion . 
Charles stopped , unwilling to interrupt , yet not knowing how to pass ; but the stranger had caught the sound of feet , and in a few seconds vanished from his view . 
`` This is too much for to-night , '' thought Charles , `` it is late already ; '' and he folded it up again , and threw it on his dressing-table . 
He wound up his watch , gave a yawn , and put on his slippers . 
He opened it again . 
`` It 's certainly a Catholic 's writing , '' he said . 
His mind glanced to the person whom he had seen under the Cross ; perhaps it glanced further . 
He sat down , and began reading in extenso : 1 . 
Charles got very sleepy before he reached the `` twenty-seventhly . '' 
`` It wo n't do , '' he said ; `` I am only losing my time . 
He put the paper from him , said his prayers , and was soon fast asleep . 
Next morning , on waking , the subject of the letter came into his mind , and he lay some time thinking over it . 
`` Certainly , '' he said , `` I do wish very much to be settled either in the English Church or somewhere else . 
He sighed . 
Well , it 's no good lying here ; '' and he jumped up and signed himself with the Cross . 
His eye caught the letter . 
Campbell had been much pleased with Charles , and his interest in him was not lessened by a hint from Bateman , that his allegiance to the English Church was in danger . 
He called on him in no long time , asked him to dinner ; and when Charles had returned his invitation , and Campbell had accepted it , the beginning of an acquaintance was formed between the rectory at Sutton and the family at Boughton , which grew into an intimacy as time went on . 
Mary was pleased at the introduction , as bringing her brother under the influence of an intellect which he could not make light of ; and , as Campbell had a carriage , it was natural that he should wish to save Charles the loss of a day 's reading and the trouble of a muddy walk to the rectory and back , by coming over himself to Boughton . 
Accordingly it so happened that he saw Charles twice at his mother 's for once that he saw him at Sutton . 
One day Charles called upon Bateman , and , on entering the room , was surprised to see him and Campbell at luncheon , and in conversation with a third person . 
Charles was evidently de trop , but there was no help for it ; so he shook hands with Willis , and accepted the pressing call of Bateman to seat himself at table , and to share their bread and cheese . 
Charles sat down opposite Willis , and for a while could not keep his eyes from him . 
At first he had some difficulty in believing he had before him the impetuous youth he had known two years and a half before . 
He had always been silent in general company ; but in that he was changed as in every thing else . 
Not that he talked more than was natural , but he talked freely and easily . 
The great change , however , was in his appearance and manner . 
He had lost his bloom and youthfulness ; his expression was sweeter indeed than before , and very placid , but there was a thin line down his face on each side of his mouth ; his cheek was wanting in fulness , and he had the air of a man of thirty . 
When he entered into conversation , and became animated , his former self returned . 
`` I suppose we may all admire this cream at this season , '' said Charles , as he helped himself , `` for we are none of us Devonshire men . '' 
asked Charles ; `` I fancied oil was the substitute . '' 
`` The taste , I suppose , is peculiar , '' observed Charles . 
`` Or the Clerk of Copmanhurst 's dry peas , '' said Charles . 
Somehow neither he nor Bateman were quite at their ease , whether with themselves or with each other ; it might be Charles 's sudden intrusion , or something which had happened before it . 
`` Take care , my fine fellows , '' thought Charles ; `` keep your ranks , or you wo n't secure your prisoner . '' 
Reding interposed : `` Bateman , cut me , please , a bit more of your capital bread -- home-made , I suppose ? '' 
`` Do n't do so , '' said Reding to Campbell ; `` it is dangerous ; do n't commit yourself in a moral question ; for then , if the thing specified did occur , it would be difficult to see our way . '' 
`` They are in a fix , '' thought Charles , `` but I will do my best to tow old Bateman out ; '' so he began : `` No , '' he said , `` Bateman only means , that one Church presents , in some particular points , a different appearance from another ; but it does not follow that , in fact , they have not a visible agreement too . 
`` There is a spell about the limina Apostolorum , '' said Charles ; `` St. Peter and St. Paul are not there for nothing . '' 
Bateman , who had remained in a state of great dissatisfaction since he last spoke , which had not been for a quarter of an hour past , did not find himself in spirits to try much to detain either them or Reding ; so he was speedily left to himself . 
He drew his chair to the fire , and for a while felt nothing more than a heavy load of disgust . 
After a time , however , his thoughts began to draw themselves out into series , and took the following form : `` It 's too bad , too bad , '' he said ; `` Campbell is a very clever man -- far cleverer than I am ; a well-read man , too ; but he has no tact , no tact . 
It is deplorable ; Reding 's coming was one misfortune ; however , we might have got over that , we might have even turned it to an advantage ; but to use such arguments as he did ! 
He jumped up , and began walking to and fro . 
Here he was interrupted by his clerk , who told him that John Tims had taken his oath that his wife should not be churched before the congregation , and was half-minded to take his infant to the Methodists for baptism ; and his thoughts took a different direction . 
The winter had been on the whole dry and pleasant , but in February and March the rains were so profuse , and the winds so high , that Bateman saw very little of either Charles or Willis . 
As to Campbell , he was resolved to exclude him from any participation in them ; but he hesitated about Reding . 
Accordingly , he told him of his anxiety to restore Willis to `` the Church of his baptism ; '' and , not discouraged by Charles 's advice to let well alone , and that he might succeed in drawing him from Rome without reclaiming him to Anglicanism , the weather having improved , he asked the two to dinner on one of the later Sundays in Lent . 
He determined to make a field-day of it ; and , with that view , he carefully got up some of the most popular works against the Church of Rome . 
After much thought , he determined to direct his attack on some of the `` practical evils , '' as he considered them , of `` Romanism ; '' as being more easy of proof than points of doctrine and history , in which too , for what he knew , Willis might by this time be better read than himself . 
`` Yes , Bateman , '' said Reding , `` you must let us enjoy our feed . 
`` He puts us to shame , '' said Charles , `` who have stepped into church from our bed-room ; he has trudged a pilgrimage to his . '' 
The armistice continued a good quarter of an hour , which Charles and Willis spent in easy conversation ; till Bateman , who had been priming himself the while with his controversial points , found himself ready for the assault , and opened it in form . 
`` That is true , '' said Charles ; `` but there must be some ground for faith ; we do not believe without reason ; and the question is , whether what the Church does , as in worship , is not a fair matter to form a judgment upon , for or against . '' 
`` Yet persons have before now been converted by the sight of Catholic worship , '' said Reding . 
But all this is a work of time ; meanwhile , it is not a bit more of an objection to the doctrine and practice of relic-veneration that a body is said to lie in two places , than to general history that Charles the First was reported by some authorities to be buried at Windsor , by others at Westminster ; which question was decided just before our times . 
Reding put in an objection ; he said that no one knew or cared about the inscription on the Monument , but religious veneration was paid to the two heads at St. John Lateran . 
`` Yes , Bateman , '' said Charles ; `` it is getting late . 
The conversation flagged ; Bateman was again busy with his memory ; and he was getting impatient too ; time was slipping away , and no blow struck ; moreover , Willis was beginning to gape , and Charles seemed impatient to be released . 
I wish I knew how to treat him ; I was wrong in having Reding here ; of course Willis would not be confidential before a third person . 
Then , reminding him it had grown late , and bidding him good night , he left the room with Charles . 
Meanwhile Willis and Charles were proceeding to their respective homes . 
Charles had been moved far more than Bateman , or rather touched , by the enthusiasm of his Catholic friend , though , from a difficulty in finding language to express himself , and a fear of being carried off his legs , he had kept his feelings to himself . 
When they were about to part , Willis said to him in a subdued tone , `` You are soon going to Oxford , dearest Reding ; Oh , that you were one with us ! 
He drew Charles to him , and kissed his cheek , and was gone before Charles had time to say a word . 
Yet Charles could not have spoken , had he had ever so much opportunity . 
He set off at a brisk pace , cutting down with his stick the twigs and brambles which the pale twilight discovered in his path . 
It seemed as if the kiss of his friend had conveyed into his own soul the enthusiasm which his words had betokened . 
He felt himself possessed , he knew not how , by a high superhuman power , which seemed able to push through mountains , and to walk the sea . 
With winter around him , he felt within like the springtide , when all is new and bright . 
He perceived that he had found , what indeed he had never sought , because he had never known what it was , but what he had ever wanted , -- a soul sympathetic with his own . 
He felt he was no longer alone in the world , though he was losing that true congenial mind the very moment he had found him . 
Was this , he asked himself , the communion of Saints ? 
how could it be , when he was in one communion , and Willis in another ? 
The time came at length for Charles to return to Oxford ; but during the last month scruples had risen in his mind , whether , with his present feelings , he could consistently even present himself for his examination . 
No subscription was necessary for his entrance into the schools , but he felt that the honours of the class-list were only intended for those who were bonâ fide adherents of the Church of England . 
He laid his difficulty before Carlton , who in consequence did his best to ascertain thoroughly his present state of mind . 
It seemed that Charles had no intention , either now or at any future day , of joining the Church of Rome ; that he felt he could not take such a step at present without distinct sin ; that it would simply be against his conscience to do so ; that he had no feeling whatever that God called him to do so ; that he felt that nothing could justify so serious an act but the conviction that he could not be saved in the Church to which he belonged ; that he had no such feeling ; that he had no definite case against his own Church sufficient for leaving it , nor any definite view that the Church of Rome was the One Church of Christ : -- that still he could not help suspecting that one day he should think otherwise ; he conceived the day might come , nay would come , when he should have that conviction which at present he had not , and which of course would be a call on him to act upon it , by leaving the Church of England for that of Rome ; he could not tell distinctly why he so anticipated , except that there were so many things which he thought right in the Church of Rome , and so many which he thought wrong in the Church of England ; and because , too , the more he had an opportunity of hearing and seeing , the greater cause he had to admire and revere the Roman Catholic system , and to be dissatisfied with his own . 
He acted thus , on the one hand , as vividly feeling the changes which take place in the minds of young men , and the difficulty of Reding foretelling his own state of opinions two years to come ; and on the other , from the reasonable anticipation that a contrary advice would have been the very way to ripen his present doubts on the untenableness of Anglicanism into conviction . 
Accordingly , his examination came off in due time ; the schools were full , he did well , and his class was considered to be secure . 
The list came out ; Sheffield was in the first class , Charles in the second . 
Charles had lost some time by his father 's death , and family matters consequent upon it ; and his virtual rustication for the last six months had been a considerable disadvantage to him . 
Moreover , though he had been a careful persevering reader , he certainly had not run the race for honours with the same devotion as Sheffield ; nor had his religious difficulties , particularly his late indecision about presenting himself at all , been without their serious influence upon his attention and his energy . 
As success had not been the first desire of his soul , so failure was not his greatest misery . 
He would have much preferred success ; but in a day or two he found he could well endure the want of it . 
Now came the question about his degree , which could not be taken without subscription to the Articles . 
Charles thought of Campbell , with whom he was on the best of terms ; and Carlton knew enough of him by reputation , to be perfectly sure that he could not be in safer hands . 
Charles , in consequence , made the proposal to him , and it was accepted . 
Nothing then remained for him , but to pay a few bills , to pack up some books which he had left in a friend 's room , and then to bid adieu , at least for a time , to the cloisters and groves of the University . 
He quitted in June , when every thing was in that youthful and fragrant beauty which he had admired so much in the beginning of his residence three years before . 
Once before we took leave to pass over nearly two years in the life of the subject of this narrative , and now a second and a dreary space of more than the same length shall be consigned to oblivion , and the reader shall be set down in the autumn of the year next but one after that in which Charles took his class and did not take his degree . 
Willis also was gone , on a different errand : he had bid adieu to his mother and brother soon after Charles had taken his class , and now was Father Aloysius de Sanctâ Cruce in the Passionist Convent of Pennington . 
`` I hardly can tell you , '' answered she ; `` she has been informed of it indeed distinctly a year ago ; but seeing Charles so often , and he in appearance just the same , I fear she does not realise it . 
But have a talk with Charles first . 
When it comes to the point , he may have a greater difficulty than he thinks beforehand . '' 
Poor Charles was sitting at an open window , looking out upon the prospect , when Campbell entered the room . 
Charles turned round , and smiled sadly . 
`` I am like Moses seeing the land , '' he said ; `` my dear Campbell , when shall the end be ? '' 
`` That , my good Charles , of course does not rest with me , '' answered Campbell . 
`` That is as much as to say , ` Act for yourself , ''' answered Charles ; `` well , I am willing . '' 
Charles dropped his head on the window-sill upon his hands . 
`` No , '' he said ; `` I trust that she , and all of us , will be supported . '' 
`` Oh , my dear Charles , '' answered Campbell , `` beware of a very subtle temptation which may come on you here . 
Charles smiled . 
he said ; `` if that were the case , should I have waited patiently two years and more ? 
`` I 'll say nothing harsh or unkind of you , Charles , '' said Campbell ; `` but it 's a most unfortunate delusion . 
answered Charles ; `` do n't you know this is the very thing which has influenced me so much all along ? 
`` I have thought of that too , '' said Charles , `` and it has influenced me a great deal . 
`` Yes , my good Charles , '' answered Campbell ; `` but the question is whether your grounds are good . 
`` Campbell , '' answered Charles , `` I consider that all reason comes from God ; our grounds must at best be imperfect ; but if they appear to be sufficient after prayer , diligent search , obedience , waiting , and , in short , doing our part , they are His voice calling us on . 
Think of our case , Charles , as well as your own ; throw yourself into our state of feeling . 
She has ten thousand gifts , she is in many respects superior to our own ; but she has a something in her which spoils all . 
I have no confidence in her ; and that being the case , how can I ` let you go ' to her ? 
''' `` Ah , '' said Charles , `` that 's our dreadful difference ; we ca n't get further than that . 
Charles slightly coloured . 
At length Charles got up , came up to Campbell , took his hand , and kissed it . 
In ten days after this conversation Charles was ready for his journey ; his room put to rights ; his portmanteau strapped ; and the gig at the door , which was to take him the first stage . 
He was to go round by Boughton ; it had been arranged by Campbell and Mary , that it would be best for him not to see his mother -LRB- to whom Campbell had broken the matter at once -RRB- till he took leave of her . 
Charles leapt from the gig with a beating heart , and ran up to his mother 's room . 
She was sitting by the fire at her work when he entered ; she held out her hand coldly to him , and he sat down . 
Nothing was said for a little while ; then , without leaving off her occupation , she said , `` Well , Charles , and so you are leaving us . 
Charles answered that he had not yet turned his mind to the consideration of any thing but the great step on which every thing else depended . 
There was another silence ; then she said , `` You wo n't find any where such friends as you have had at home , Charles . '' 
Presently she continued , `` You have had every thing in your favour , Charles ; you have been blessed with talents , advantages of education , easy circumstances ; many a deserving young man has to scramble on as he can . '' 
Charles answered , that he was deeply sensible how much he owed in temporal matters to Providence , and that it was only at His bidding that he was giving them up . 
`` We all looked up to you , Charles ; perhaps we made too much of you ; well , God be with you ; you have taken your line . '' 
Poor Charles said that no one could conceive what it cost him to give up what was so very dear to him , what was part of himself ; there was nothing on earth which he prized like his home . 
`` Oh really , my dear mother , '' cried he , `` if you saw my heart ! 
`` We are heathens , then , '' she replied ; `` thank you , Charles , I am obliged to you for this ; '' and she dashed away a tear from her eye . 
Charles was almost beside himself ; he did not know what to say ; he stood up and leaned his elbow on the mantel-piece , supporting his head on his hand . 
`` Well , Charles , '' she continued , still going on with her work , `` perhaps the day will come '' ... her voice faltered ; `` your dear father '' ... she put down her work . 
`` It is useless misery , '' said Charles ; `` why should I stay ? 
He threw himself on his knees , and laid his cheek on her lap ; she could no longer resist him ; she hung over him , and began to smooth down his hair as she had done when he was a child . 
At length scalding tears began to fall heavily upon his face and neck ; he bore them for a while , then started up , kissed her cheek impetuously , and rushed out of the room . 
In a few seconds he had seen and had torn himself from his sisters , and was in his gig again by the side of his phlegmatic driver , dancing slowly up and down on his way to Collumpton . 
The reader may ask whither Charles is going , and , though it would not be quite true to answer that he did not know better than the said reader himself , yet he had most certainly very indistinct notions what was becoming of him even locally , and , like the Patriarch , `` went out , not knowing whither he went . '' 
Charles had a faintish feeling come over him ; somewhat such as might beset a man on hearing a call for pork-chops when he was sea-sick . 
He retreated behind a pile of ledgers and other stationary , but they could not save him from the low , thrilling tones which from time to time passed from one to the other . 
Charles breathed freely as they went out ; a severe text of Scripture rose on his mind , but he repressed the censorious or uncharitable feeling , and turned himself to the anxious duties which lay before him . 
Nothing happened to Charles worth relating before his arrival at Steventon next day ; when , the afternoon being fine , he left his portmanteau to follow him by the omnibus , and put himself upon the road . 
If it required some courage to undertake by himself a long journey on an all-momentous errand , it did not lessen the difficulty that that journey took in its way a place and person so dear to him as Oxford and Carlton . 
Charles expected to be recognised ; but the resident passed by with that half-conscious , uncertain gaze which seemed to have some memory of a face which yet was strange . 
He had passed Folly Bridge ; troops of horsemen overtook him , talking loud , while with easy jaunty pace they turned into their respective stables . 
He crossed to Christ Church , and penetrated to Peckwater . 
Many stared , but no one knew him . 
He hurried up Oriel Lane ; suddenly a start and a low bow from a passer-by ; who could it be ? 
it was a superannuated shoeblack of his college , to whom he had sometimes given a stray shilling . 
He gained the High Street , and turned down towards the Angel . 
Charles felt an instinctive quivering ; but it passed by him , and did no harm . 
Like Kehama , he had a charmed life . 
And now he had reached his inn , where he found his portmanteau all ready for him . 
He chose a bed-room , and , after fully inducting himself into it , turned his thoughts towards dinner . 
He wished to lose no time , but , if possible , to proceed to London the following morning . 
It would be a great point if he could get to his journey 's end so early in the week , that by Sunday , if he was thought worthy , he might offer up his praises for the mercies vouchsafed to him , in the great and holy communion of the Universal Church . 
Accordingly he determined to make an attempt on Carlton that evening ; and hoped , if he went to his room between seven and eight , to find him returned from Common Room . 
Charles determined to wait for him . 
The servant lighted candles in the inner room ; and Charles sat down at the fire . 
For a while he sat in reflection ; then he looked about for something to occupy him . 
His eye caught an Oxford paper ; it was but a few days old . 
`` Let us see how the old place goes on , '' he said to himself , as he took it up . 
He glanced from one article to another , looking who were the University-preachers of the week , who had taken degrees , who were public examiners , & c. & c. , when his eye was arrested by the following paragraph : `` Defection from the Church . 
`` So , '' thought Charles , `` the world , as usual , is beforehand with me ; '' and he sat speculating about the origin of the report , till he almost forgot that he was waiting for Carlton . 
While Charles was learning in Carlton 's rooms the interest which the world took in his position and acts , he was actually furnishing a topic of conversation to that portion of it which was assembled in social meeting in the neighbouring Common Room . 
`` He has other friends in the room , '' said another : `` I think , '' turning to a young Fellow of Leicester , `` you , Sheffield , were at one time intimate with Reding . '' 
He said that his religious notions carried Reding away , and spoiled his reading . '' 
Meanwhile the conversation was in another quarter dwelling upon poor Charles . 
they ca n't help it , '' said another , in a low voice , to his neighbour . 
`` Well , '' said the first of the two , drawing himself up and speaking in the air , `` how any educated man should '' -- his voice was overpowered by the grave enunciation of a small man behind them , who had hitherto kept silence , and now spoke with positiveness . 
He addressed himself , between the two heads which had been just talking in private , to the group beyond them . 
`` It 's all the effect of rationalism , '' he said ; `` the whole movement is rationalistic . 
Reding ! '' 
Then gravely , `` Reding , where are you ? '' 
`` Not yet a Catholic , '' said Reding . 
`` Sit down , my dear Reding ; will you have any thing ? 
`` If you have made up your mind , Reding , '' said Carlton , `` it 's no good talking . 
You must always be yourself ; as a Romanist , you will still be Charles Reding . '' 
`` We must leave these things to a Higher Power , '' said Carlton ; `` I hope we sha 'n' t be less friends , Reding , when you are in another communion . 
Reding sighed ; he saw clearly that his change of religion , when completed , would not fail to have an effect on Carlton 's thoughts of him , as on those of others . 
After a while , Carlton said gently , `` Is it quite impossible , Reding , that now at the eleventh hour we may retain you ? 
`` Do n't let us argue , dear Carlton , '' answered Reding ; `` I have done with argument . 
He stopped , and Carlton did not reply ; a silence ensued , and Charles at length broke it . 
`` Understand me , '' answered Reding ; `` I have come to my resolution with great deliberation . 
`` I do , I do retain them , '' answered Reding ; `` they are always upon me . '' 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` I grant , I maintain , that the only motive which is sufficient to justify a move , is the conviction that one 's salvation depends on it . 
`` You know it is Scripture language , '' answered Reding . 
`` Then do n't talk to me about our position , '' said Charles ; `` I hardly expected you to make this answer ; but it is what the majority of Church-of-England people say . 
Reding had got somewhat excited ; the paragraph in the newspaper had annoyed him . 
But without taking that into account , there was enough in the circumstances in which he found himself to throw him out of his ordinary state of mind . 
He was in a crisis of peculiar trial , which a person must have felt to understand . 
At length Carlton said , `` I hope , dear Reding , you are not joining the Church of Rome merely because there are unreasonable , unfeeling persons in the Church of England . '' 
Charles felt that he was not shewing to advantage , and that he was giving rise to the very surmises about the motives of his conversion which he was deprecating . 
`` It is a sad thing , '' he said with something of self-reproach , `` to spend our last minutes in wrangling . 
Presently he said , dryly and abruptly , `` Reding , do you know any Roman Catholics ? '' 
`` No , '' answered Reding ; `` Willis indeed , but I hav 'n' t seen even him these two years . 
asked Reding . 
said Reding . 
asked Charles . 
Charles thought a while ; then he said , `` Certainly , I do n't like many things which are done and said by Roman Catholics just now ; but I do n't see how all this can be more than a trial and a cross ; I do n't see how it affects the great question . '' 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` as to the fact , I know nothing about it ; it may be as you say , but I do n't think much of your proof . 
Reding smiled at Carlton , and slowly shook his head to and fro , while he said , `` They write English , I suppose , as classically as St. John writes Greek . '' 
There was no good in disputing , as might be seen from the first ; each had his own view , and that was the beginning and end of the matter . 
Charles stood up . 
`` Well , dearest Carlton , '' he said , `` we must part ; it must be going on for eleven . '' 
He pulled out of his pocket a small `` Christian Year . '' 
`` You have often seen me with this , '' he continued ; `` accept it in memory of me . 
He stopped , much affected . 
`` Oh , it is very hard to leave you all , to go to strangers , '' he went on ; `` I do not wish it , but I can not help it ; I am called , I am compelled . '' 
He stopped again ; the tears flowed down his cheeks . 
`` All is well , '' he said , recovering himself , `` all is well ; but it 's hard at the time , and scarcely any one to feel for me ; black looks , bitter words ... I am pleasing myself , following my own will ! 
... well ... '' and he began looking at his fingers , and slowly rubbing his palms one on another . 
`` It must be , '' he whispered to himself , `` through tribulation to the kingdom , sowing in tears , reaping in joy ... '' Another pause , and a new train of thought came over him ; `` Oh , '' he said , `` I fear so very much , so very much , that all you who do not come forward will go back . 
They embraced each other affectionately ; and the next minute Charles was running down the staircase . 
Charles went to bed with a bad headache , and woke with a worse . 
Nothing remained but to order his bill , and be off for London . 
Yet he could not go without taking a last farewell of the place itself . 
He was up soon after seven ; and while the gownsmen were rising and in their respective chapels , he had been round Magdalen Walk and Christ Church Meadow . 
Charles thought he had seen his face before , but he could not recollect where or when . 
But what most interested him was his dress , which was such as is rarely found in a travelling-companion . 
It was of a foreign character , and taken together with the small office-book he held in his hand , plainly shewed Charles that he was opposite a Roman ecclesiastic . 
Charles made an awkward apology , and there was silence again . 
Charles assented . 
He was of near Master 's standing . 
His companion , who did not seem in a humour for talking , proceeded to various questions about the University , as if out of civility . 
Charles had so much to ask ; his thoughts were busy , and his mind full . 
After a time Charles suddenly said , `` How came you to suppose I was of Oxford ? '' 
`` I have heard others say the same , '' said Charles ; `` yet I ca n't myself make out how an Oxford man should be known from another . '' 
`` I know persons , '' said Charles , `` who believe that handwriting is an indication of calling and character . '' 
`` It is a fearful thought , '' said Charles with a sigh , `` that we , as it were , exhale ourselves every breath we draw . '' 
The stranger assented ; `` A man 's moral being , '' he said , `` is concentrated in each moment of his life ; it lives in the tips of his fingers , and the spring of his insteps . 
`` I think I must be speaking to a Catholic Priest , '' said Charles : when his question was answered in the affirmative , he went on hesitatingly to ask if what they had been speaking of did not illustrate the importance of faith ? 
`` One did not see at first sight , '' he said , `` how it was rational to maintain that so much depended on holding this or that doctrine , or a little more or a little less , but it might be a test of the heart . '' 
His companion looked pleased ; however , he observed , that `` there was no more or less in faith ; that either we believed the whole revealed message , or really we believed no part of it ; that we ought to believe what the Church proposed to us on the word of the Church . '' 
`` Yet surely the so-called Evangelical believes more than the Unitarian , and the High-Churchman than the Evangelical , '' objected Charles . 
`` The question , '' said his fellow-traveller , `` is , whether they submit their reason implicitly to that which they have received as God 's word . '' 
Charles assented . 
`` Would you say , then , '' he continued , `` that the Unitarian really believes that which he professes to receive as God 's word , when he passes over and gets rid of so much that is in that word ? '' 
`` Certainly not , '' said Charles . 
`` Because it is plain , '' said Charles , `` that his ultimate standard of truth is not the Scripture , but , unconsciously to himself , some view of things in his mind which is the measure of Scripture . '' 
`` Well , in like manner , '' he continued , `` do you think a person can have real faith in that which he admits to be the word of God , who passes by , without attempting to understand , such passages as , ` the Church the pillar and ground of the truth ; ' or , ` whosesoever sins ye remit , they are remitted ; ' or , ` if any man is sick , let him call for the elders of the Church , and let them anoint him with oil ? 
''' `` Yes , '' said Charles ; `` but , in fact , we do not profess to have faith in the mere text of Scripture . 
You know , sir , '' he added hesitatingly , `` that the Anglican doctrine is to interpret Scripture by the Church ; therefore we have faith , like Catholics , not in Scripture simply , but in the whole word committed to the Church , of which Scripture is a part . '' 
His companion smiled ; `` How many , '' he asked , `` so profess ? 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` I am sure I know a good many persons , -- and if you knew the Church of England as I do , you would not need me to tell you , -- who , from knowledge of the Gospels , have an absolute conviction and an intimate sense of the reality of the sacred facts contained in them , which , whether you call it faith or not , is powerful enough to colour their whole being with its influence , and rules their heart and conduct as well as their imagination . 
asked his companion . 
`` Certainly they do , '' answered Charles , `` as far as man can judge . '' 
Charles said , this did not fully meet the difficulty ; faith , in the case of these persons , at least was not faith in the word of the Church . 
His companion would not allow this ; he said they received the Scripture on the testimony of the Church , that the Scripture represented the whole word of God committed to the Church , and the like . 
Presently Charles said , `` It is to me a great mystery how the English people , as a whole , is ever to have faith again is there evidence enough for faith ? '' 
His new friend looked surprised and not overpleased ; `` Surely , '' he said , `` in matter of fact , a man may have more evidence for believing the Church to be the messenger of God , than he has for believing the Gospels to be from God . 
`` But the belief in the Gospels is a traditional belief , '' said Charles ; `` that makes all the difference . 
`` Still , it seems to me a great difficulty , '' answered Charles ; `` I do not see , when the dogmatic structure is once broken down , how it is ever to be built up again . 
His fellow-traveller had for some time shewn signs of uneasiness ; when Charles stopped , he said shortly , but quietly , `` What is to make him believe ! 
Charles hesitated ; he proceeded ; `` If there is evidence enough to believe Scripture , and we see that there is , I repeat , there is more than enough to believe the Church . 
`` Well , '' said Charles , `` I think there is a general feeling among educated Anglicans , that the claims of the Roman Church do not rest on a sufficiently intellectual basis ; that the evidences , or notes , were well enough for a rude age , not for this . 
His companion looked round curiously at him , and then said quietly , `` Depend upon it , there is quite evidence enough for a moral conviction that the Catholic or Roman Church , and none other , is the voice of God . '' 
`` Do you mean , '' said Charles , with a beating heart , `` that before conversion one can attain to a present abiding actual conviction of this truth ? '' 
''' `` Then you mean to say , '' said Charles , while his heart beat faster , `` that such a person is under no duty to wait for clearer light . '' 
Charles said that he feared there was a great temptation operating on many well-informed and excellent men , to find fault with the evidence for Catholicity , and to give over the search , on the excuse that there were arguments on both sides . 
`` It is not one set of men , '' answered his companion ; `` it is the grievous deficiency in Englishmen altogether . 
There was nothing in all this exactly new to Charles ; but it was pleasant to hear it from the voice of another , and him a priest . 
Thus he had sympathy and authority , and felt he was restored to himself . 
After a while he disclosed to his new friend the errand which took him to London , which , after what Charles had already been saying , could be no great surprise to him . 
The latter knew the Superior of San Michaele , and taking out a card , wrote upon it a few words of introduction for him . 
Reding naturally wished to take the important step he was meditating as quietly as he could ; and had taken what he considered satisfactory measures for this purpose . 
But such arrangements often turn out very differently from their promise ; and so it was in his case . 
The Passionist House was in the eastern part of London ; so far well ; -- and as he knew in the neighbourhood a respectable publisher in the religious line , with whom his father had dealt , he had written to him to bespeak a room in his house for the few days , which he trusted would suffice for the process of his reception . 
What was to happen to him after it , he left for the advice he might get from those in whose hands he found himself . 
It was now Wednesday ; he hoped to have two days to prepare himself for his confession , and then he proposed to present himself before those who were to receive it . 
His better plan would have been , to have gone to the Religious House at once ; where doubtless the good fathers would have lodged him , secured him from intrusion , and given him the best advice how to proceed . 
But we must indulge him , if , doing so great a work , he likes to do it in his own way ; nor must we be hard on him , though it be not the best way . 
On arriving at his destination , he saw in the deportment of his host grounds for concluding that his coming was not only expected , but understood . 
Doubtless , then , the paragraph of the `` Oxford Gazette '' had been copied into the London papers ; nor did it relieve his unpleasant surprise , to find , as he passed to his room , that the worthy bibliopolist had a reading-room attached to his shop , which was far more perilous to his privacy than a coffee-room would have been . 
He was not obliged , however , to mix with the various parties who seemed to frequent it ; and he determined as far as possible to confine himself to his apartment . 
The rest of the day he employed in writing letters to friends ; his conversation of the morning had tranquillised him ; he went to bed peaceful and happy , slept soundly , rose late , and , refreshed in mind and body , turned his thoughts to the serious duties of the day . 
Breakfast over , he gave a considerable time to devotional exercises , and then opening his writing-desk , addressed himself to his work . 
Hardly had he got into it , when his landlord made his appearance ; and , with many apologies for his intrusion , and a hope that he was not going to be impertinent , proceeded to inquire if Mr. Reding was a Catholic . 
Charles could make no intelligible objection to the request ; and in the course of a few minutes their knock was heard at the room-door . 
On his answering it , two persons presented themselves , apparently both strangers to him . 
This , however , at the moment was a relief ; for vague fears and surmises had begun to flit across his mind as to the faces which were to make their appearance . 
It broke upon Charles that he had seen him before , but he could not tell where . 
`` I ought to know your face , '' he said . 
`` Ah , I remember perfectly , '' said Reding ; `` Jack , the kitchen-boy at St. Saviour 's . '' 
`` So it seems , Jack , '' answered Reding ; `` but what are you ? 
Oh , I know , '' cried Charles ; `` it 's some sect ; the Sandemanians '' -- `` Sandemanians ! '' 
`` That 's right , Jack , '' said Reding ; `` but it 's not distinctive enough ; so are we all ; every one will say as much . '' 
`` Ah , '' said Charles , `` I see ; that 's what the gods call you ; now , what do men ? '' 
`` Men , '' said Jack , not understanding , however , the allusion -- `` men call us Christians professing the opinions of the late Rev. Edward Irving , B.D. '' `` I understand perfectly now , '' said Reding ; `` Irvingites -- I recollect '' -- `` No , sir , '' he said , `` not Irvingites ; we do not follow man ; we follow wherever the Spirit leads us ; we have given up Tongue . 
Mr. Highfly was a man of gentlemanlike appearance and manner ; his language was refined , and his conduct was delicate ; so much so that Charles at once changed his tone in speaking to him . 
He came to Mr. Reding , he said , from a sense of duty ; and there was nothing in his conversation to clash with this profession . 
He explained that he had heard of Mr. Reding 's being unsettled in his religious views , and he would not lose the opportunity of attempting to obtain so valuable an accession to the cause to which he had dedicated himself . 
`` I see , '' said Charles , smiling , `` I am in the market . '' 
`` It is , I recollect , one of the characteristics of your body , '' said Charles , `` to have an order of Apostles , in addition to Bishops , Priests , and Deacons . '' 
`` Rather , '' said his visitor , `` it is the special characteristic ; for we acknowledge the orders of the Church of England . 
`` What I should complain of , '' said Charles , `` were I at all inclined to listen to your claims , would be the very different views which different members of your body put forward . '' 
`` Certainly , '' answered Reding , `` things have been said to me by your teachers which I must suppose were only private opinions , though they seemed to be more . '' 
`` I am disposed to agree with you there , '' said Charles . 
`` But does it not strike you , Mr. Highfly , '' answered Reding , `` that there is a body of Christians , and not an inconsiderable one , which maintains with you , and , what is more , has always preserved , that true and higher Apostolic succession in the Church ; a body , I mean , which , in addition to Episcopacy , believes that there is a standing ordinance above Episcopacy , and gives it the name of the Apostolate ? '' 
`` It is quite plain whom I mean -- the Catholics , '' answered Charles . 
`` Allow me to say it , Mr. Highfly , '' said Reding , `` it is a reason for every Irvingite -- I mean , every member of your persuasion -- becoming a Catholic . 
And hence Catholics call him Vicar of Christ , Bishop of Bishops , and the like ; and , I believe , consider that he , and not the Bishop , is the true pastor or ruler of the Church -- the source of jurisdiction , the judge of controversies , and the centre of unity -- as having the powers of the Apostles , and specially of St. Peter . '' 
`` Do n't you think , then , it would be well , '' continued Charles , `` that , before coming to convert me , you should first join the Catholic Church ? 
With that he got up , and Jack with him , and , with many courteous bows and smiles , which were duly responded to by Reding , the two visitors took their departure . 
`` Well , I might have been worse off , '' thought Reding ; `` really they are gentle , well-mannered animals , after all . 
he added . 
he cried ; upon which the door gently opened , and a young lady , not without personal attractions , presented herself . 
Charles started up with vexation ; but there was no help for it , and he was obliged to hand her a chair , and then to wait all expectation , or rather all impatience , to be informed of her mission . 
`` May I ask , '' said Charles , `` the name of the intended persuasion ? '' 
Charles did not know how to answer to so liberal an offer . 
It got too absurd ; and Charles , who had for an instant been amused , now became full of the one thought , how to get her out of the room . 
`` From what you tell me , '' said Charles , `` I gather that every member of your new community is allowed to name one or two doctrines of his own . '' 
Charles tried to cut short the interview by denying that he had any religion to seek after , or any decision to make ; but it was easier to end the conversation than the visit . 
He threw himself back in his chair in despair , and half closed his eyes . 
`` Oh , those good Irvingites , '' he thought , `` blameless men , who came only to protest , and vanished at the first word of opposition ; but now thrice has the church-clock struck the quarters since her entrance , and I do n't see why she 's not to stop here as long as it goes on striking , since she has stopped so long . 
There was no need of discharging her ; for , as kindly as she had unfolded her leaves and flourished in the sun of Reding 's forbearance , so did she at once shrink and vanish -- one could hardly tell how -- before the rough accents of the intruder ; and Charles suddenly found himself in the hands of a new tormentor . 
`` This is intolerable , '' he said to himself ; and jumping up , he cried , `` Sir , excuse me , I am particularly engaged this morning , and I must beg to decline the favour of your visit . '' 
said the stranger ; and , taking a note-book and pencil from his pocket , he began to look up in Charles 's face and write down his words , saying half aloud , as he wrote , `` declines the favour of my visit . '' 
Then he looked up again , keeping his pencil upon his paper , and said , `` Now , sir . '' 
Reding moved towards him , and spreading his arms as one drives sheep and poultry in one direction , he repeated , looking towards the door , `` Really , sir , I feel the honour of your call ; but another day , sir , another day . 
`` Why , sir , '' answered Charles , `` I am sure you are come on an errand as fruitless as hers ; and I am sick of these religious discussions , and want to be to myself , and to save you trouble . '' 
Charles did not deign to notice his act or to explain his own expression ; he stood prepared to renew his action of motioning him to the door . 
His tormentor then said , `` You may like to know my name ; it is Zerubbabel . '' 
Vexed as Reding was , he felt that he had no right to visit the tediousness of his former visitor upon his present ; so he forced himself to reply , `` Zerubbabel ; indeed ; and is Zerubbabel your Christian name , sir , or your surname ? '' 
`` Stranger things have happened , '' answered his visitor ; `` for instance , I myself was once a deacon in the Church of England . '' 
said Charles . 
`` I am a Jew by choice , '' he said . 
`` You are not likely to have many followers in such a belief , '' said Charles ; `` we are all for progress now , not for retrograding . '' 
`` That is rather with a view of making the Jews Christians , than the Christians Jews , '' said Reding . 
Charles thought he had better let him have his talk out ; so Zerubbabel proceeded : `` The good Bishop in question knows well that the Jew is the elder brother of the Gentile , and it is his special mission to restore a Jewish episcopate to the See of Jerusalem . 
`` You seem to allow , '' said Charles , `` that there ought to be a centre of unity and a Pope . '' 
`` It has hitherto been thought a sin , '' said Reding , `` to attempt rebuilding the Temple . 
Here he came to a pause ; and Charles making no reply , he said , `` May I not hope you will give your name to this religious object , and adopt the old ritual ? 
Charles answering in the negative , Zerubbabel wrote down in his book : `` Refuses to take part in our scheme ; '' and disappeared from the room , as suddenly as he entered it . 
Charles 's trials were not at an end ; and we suspect the reader will give a shudder at the news , as having a very material share in the infliction . 
Yet the reader 's case has this great alleviation , that he takes up this narrative in an idle hour , and Charles encountered the reality in a very busy and anxious one . 
So , however , it was ; not any great time elapsed after the retreat of Zerubbabel , when his landlord again appeared at the door . 
He assured Mr. Reding that it was no fault of his that the last two persons had called on him ; that the lady had slipped by him , and the gentleman had forced his way ; but that he now really did wish to solicit an interview for a personage of great literary pretensions , who sometimes dealt with him , and who had come from the West End for the honour of an interview with Mr. Reding . 
Charles groaned , but only one reply was possible ; the day was already wasted ; and with a sort of dull resignation he gave permission for the introduction of the stranger . 
Not knowing what he was driving at , Reding remained in an attitude of expectation . 
`` I belong , '' he continued , `` to a Society which is devoted to the extension among all classes of the pursuit of Truth . 
And here is your diploma , '' he added , handing a sheet of paper to him . 
Charles glanced his eye over it ; it was a paper , part engraving , part print , part manuscript . 
Then followed some sentences to the effect , that the London Branch Association of the British and Foreign Truth Society , having evidence of the zeal in the pursuit of Truth of Charles Reding , Esq. , member of Oxford University , had unanimously elected him into their number , and had assigned him the dignified and responsible office of associate and corresponding member . 
`` I thank the Truth Society very much , '' said Charles , when he got to the end of the paper , `` for this mark of their good will ; yet I regret to have scruples about accepting it , till some of the patrons are changed , whose heads are prefixed to the diploma . 
`` Not much , I fear , '' said Charles , `` seeing it did not hinder him from deliberately embracing error . '' 
`` I fear , '' said Reding , `` there is a very serious difference between your principles and my own on this point . '' 
Charles turned to the page , and read as follows : 1 . 
Charles did not get farther than these , but others followed of a similar character . 
He returned the pamphlet to Mr. Batts . 
''' `` But contradictions can not be true , '' said Charles : `` if Christianity says that Truth can be found , it must be an error to state that it can not be found . '' 
It was useless proceeding in the discussion ; Charles repressed the answer which rose on his tongue of the essential connexion of philosophy with religion ; a silence ensued of several minutes , and Mr. Batts at length took the hint , for he rose with a disappointed air , and wished him good morning . 
His glossy black dress , in contrast with the pink colour of his face and throat , for he wore no collars , and his staid and pompous bearing , added to by his rapid delivery , when he spoke , gave him much the look of a farm-yard turkey-cock , in the eyes of any one who was less disgusted with seeing new faces than Reding was at that moment . 
The new-comer looked sharply at him as he entered . 
`` Your most obedient , '' he said abruptly ; `` you seem in low spirits , my dear sir ; but sit down , Mr. Reding , and give me the opportunity of offering to you a little good advice . 
Mr. Reding , '' he continued , pulling his chair towards him , and putting out his hand as if he was going to paw him , `` have not you made a mistake , in thinking it necessary to go to the Romish Church for a relief of your religious difficulties ? '' 
`` You have not yet heard from me , sir , '' answered Charles gravely , `` that I have any difficulties at all . 
`` Well , my dear Mr. Reding , but listen to me , '' answered his persecutor , spreading out the fingers of his right hand , and opening his eyes wide ; `` I am right , I believe , in apprehending that your reason for leaving the Establishment is , that you can not carry out the surplice in the pulpit and the candlesticks on the table . 
And he sat upright in his chair , with his hands flat on his extended knees , watching with a self-satisfied air the effect of his words upon Reding . 
`` I have had enough of this , '' said poor Charles ; `` you , indeed , are but one of a number , sir , and would say you had nothing to do with the rest ; but I can not help regarding you as the fifth , or sixth , or seventh person -- I ca n't count them -- who has been with me this morning , giving me , though with the best intentions , advice which has not been asked for . 
And Charles rose up . 
His visitor did not seem inclined to move , or to notice what he had said . 
He stopped a while , opened his handkerchief with much deliberation , and blew his nose ; then he continued ; `` Kitchens is my name , sir ; Dr. Kitchens : your state of mind , Mr. Reding , is not unknown to me ; you are at present under the influence of the old Adam , and indeed in a melancholy way . 
Charles remained silent and grave , as one who was likely suddenly to break out into some strong act , rather than to condescend to any further parleying . 
He stopped a while , then he continued : `` And what was it , do you think , Mr. Reding , which had this effect on them ? 
The time at length was come ; Reding could not bear more ; and , as it happened , his visitor 's offence gave him the means , as well as a cause , for punishing him . 
`` Oh , '' he said suddenly , `` then I suppose , Dr. Kitchens , you ca n't tolerate the Cross ? '' 
`` Then look here , '' said Charles , taking a small Crucifix out of his writing-desk ; and he held it before Dr. Kitchens ' face . 
Dr. Kitchens at once started on his feet , and retreated . 
he said , and his face flushed up and then turned pale ; `` what 's that ? 
it 's the thing itself ; '' and he made a snatch at it . 
`` I declare , '' said Reding to himself , `` it really has power over him ; '' and he still confronted it to Dr. Kitchens , while he kept it out of Dr. Kitchens 's reach . 
`` Take it away , Mr. Reding , I beseech you , '' cried Dr. Kitchens , still retreating , while Charles still pressed on him ; `` take it away , it 's too much . 
Charles now had victory in his hands : there was , indeed , some difficulty in steering Dr. Kitchens to the door from the place where he had been sitting ; but that once effected , he opened it with violence , and throwing himself on the staircase , he began jumping down two or three steps at a time , with such forgetfulness of every thing but his own terror , that he came plump upon two persons , who , in rivalry of each other , were in the act or rushing up ; and while he drove one against the rail , he fairly rolled the other to the bottom . 
Charles threw himself on his chair , burying the Crucifix in his bosom , quite worn out with his long trial and the sudden exertion in which it had just now been issuing . 
When a noise was heard at his door , and knocks succeeded , he took no further notice than to plant his feet on the fender , and bury his face in his hands . 
The summons at first was apparently from one person only , but his delay in answering it gave time for the arrival of another ; and there was a brisk succession of alternate knocks from the two , which Charles let take its course . 
At length one of the rival candidates for admission , bolder than the other , slowly opened the door when the other , who had impetuously scramble up stairs after his fall , rushed in before him , crying out , `` One word for the New Jerusalem ! '' 
`` In charity , '' said Reding , without changing his attitude `` in charity , leave me alone . 
And he rose up and advanced towards him . 
And he opened the door for him . 
`` Ten thousand pardons for his rudeness , my dear sir , ten thousand pardons , but allow me ; '' and he bowed him out of the room . 
He then turned round to the other stranger , who had stood by in silence : `` And you too , sir -- is it possible ! '' 
His countenance changed to extreme surprise ; it was Mr. Malcolm . 
Charles 's thoughts flowed in a new current , and his tormentors were suddenly forgotten . 
He had always been a collector of old books , and had often taken advantage of the stores of Charles 's landlord in adding to his library . 
Passing through London to the Eastern Counties rail , he happened to call in ; and as the worthy bookseller was not behind his own reading-room in the diffusion of gossip , he learned that the Mr. Reding , who was on the point of seceding from the Establishment , was at that moment above stairs . 
He waited with impatience through Dr. Kitchens 's visit , and even then found himself , to his no small annoyance , in danger of being outstripped by the good Swedenborgian . 
`` How d'ye do , Charles ? '' 
he said at length , with not a little stiffness in his manner , while Charles had no less awkwardness in receiving him ; `` you have been holding a levee this morning ; I thought I should never get to see you . 
In spite of the diversified trial Charles had sustained from strangers that morning , there was no one perhaps whom he would have less desired to see than Mr. Malcolm . 
`` Well , Charles Reding , '' he said , `` I think we know each other well enough for you to have given me a hint of what was going on as regards you . '' 
Charles said he had written to him only the evening before . 
Charles said he wished to spare so kind a friend , ... he bungled , and could not finish his sentence . 
Charles was very much hurt ; the more so , because he had nothing to say ; he kept silence . 
`` Well , Charles , '' said Mr. Malcolm , not looking at him , `` I have known you from this high ; more , from a child in arms . 
`` My dear sir , '' said Charles , `` it pierces me to the heart to hear you talk so . 
All this was the best justification for Charles 's not having spoken to Mr. Malcolm on the subject . 
`` No , '' answered Charles . 
Charles looked very uncomfortable . 
Charles did not know what to say . 
`` Silly boy , '' he went on , `` you have not a word to say for yourself ; it 's all idle fancy . 
Reding began to rouse himself ; he felt he ought to say something ; he felt that silence would tell against him . 
`` Dear sir , '' he answered , `` there 's nothing but may be turned against one , if a person is so minded . 
Poor Reding ; he has been spared this . 
`` A troublesome world ; good bye , Charles ; you are high and mighty now , and are in full sail : you may come to your father 's friend some day in a different temper . 
There was no help for it ; Charles 's heart was full , but his head was wearied and confused , and his spirits sunk : for all these reasons he had not a word to say , and seemed to Mr. Malcolm either stupid or close . 
`` This will never do , '' said Charles , as he closed the door , and ran up stairs ; `` here is a day wasted , worse than wasted , wasted partly on strangers , partly on friends ; and it 's hard to say in which case a more thorough waste . 
The thought flashed into his mind , and he stood over the fire dwelling on it . 
`` Yes , '' he said , `` I will delay no longer . 
He then thought again , `` I 'll get over my dinner , and then at once betake myself to my good Passionists . '' 
To the coffee-house then he went , and , as it was some way off , it is not wonderful that it was near six before he arrived at the Convent . 
And now the reader knows much more about the Passionists than did Reding at the time that he made his way to their monastery . 
The church-door came first , and , as it was open , he entered it . 
When he got inside , the person who immediately preceded him dipped his finger into a vessel of water which stood at the entrance , and offered it to Charles . 
Charles , ignorant what it meant , and awkward from his consciousness of it , did nothing but slink aside , and look for some place of refuge ; but the whole space was open , and there seemed no corner to retreat into . 
Every one , however , seemed about his own business ; no one minded him , and so far he felt at his ease . 
He stood near the door , and began to look about him . 
On looking attentively , Charles made out at last that it was an image of Our Lady , and the Child held out a rosary . 
Here a congregation had already assembled , or rather was in the middle of some service , to him unknown . 
Reding turned his eyes else-where . 
They fell first on one , then on another confessional , round each of which was a little crowd , kneeling , waiting every one his own turn for presenting himself for the sacrament -- the men at the one , the women at the other . 
The growing object of attention at present was the High Altar ; and each person , as he entered , took a chair , and kneeling down behind it , began his prayers . 
Had Reding continued standing , no one would have noticed him ; but he saw the time was come for him to kneel , and accordingly he moved into a corner-seat on the bench nearest him . 
He had hardly done so , when a procession with lights passed from the sacristy to the altar ; something went on which he did not understand , and then suddenly began what , by the Miserere and Ora pro nobis , he perceived to be a litany ; a hymn followed . 
Reding thought he never had been present at worship before , so absorbed was the attention , so intense was the devotion of the congregation . 
What particularly struck him was , that whereas in the Church of England the clergyman or the organ was every thing and the people nothing , except so far as the clerk is their representative , here it was just reversed . 
There was no mistaking it ; Reding said to himself , `` This is a popular religion . '' 
He looked around at the building ; it was , as we have said , very plain , and bore the marks of being unfinished ; but the Living Temple which was manifested in it needed not curious carving or rich marble to complete it , `` for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lamb was the light thereof . '' 
`` How wonderful , '' said Charles to himself , `` that people call this worship formal and external ; it seems to possess all classes , young and old , polished and vulgar , men and women indiscriminately ; it is the working of one Spirit in all , making many one . '' 
While he was thus thinking , a change came over the worship . 
The Breviary offices were by this time not unknown to Reding ; and as he threw himself on the pavement , in sudden self-abasement and joy , some words of those great Antiphons came into his mouth , from which Willis had formerly quoted : `` O Adonai , et Dux domûs Israel , qui Moysi in rubo apparuisti ; O Emmanuel , Exspectatio Gentium et Salvator earum , veni ad salvandum nos , Domine Deus noster . '' 
The function did not last very long after this ; Reding , on looking up , found the congregation rapidly diminishing , and the lights in course of extinction . 
He saw he must be quick in his motions . 
He made his way to a lay brother , who was waiting till the doors could be closed , and begged to be conducted to the Superior . 
Charles 's feelings were indescribable , but all pleasurable . 
His heart beat , not with fear or anxiety , but from the thrill of delight with which he realised that he was beneath the shadow of a Catholic community , and face to face with one of its priests . 
His trouble went in a moment , and he could have laughed for joy . 
He could hardly keep his countenance , and almost feared to be taken for a fool . 
He presented the card of his railroad companion . 
The good Father smiled when he saw the name , nor did the few words which were written in pencil on the card diminish his satisfaction . 
Charles and he soon came to an understanding ; he found himself already known in the community by means of Willis ; and it was arranged that he should take up his lodging with his new friends forthwith , and remain there as long as it suited him . 
It was Sunday morning , about seven o'clock , and Charles had been admitted into the communion of the Catholic Church about an hour since . 
He was still kneeling in the church of the Passionists before the Tabernacle , in the possession of a deep peace and serenity of mind , which he had not thought possible on earth . 
It was such as to throw him back in memory on his earliest years , as if he were really beginning life again . 
But there was more than the happiness of childhood in his heart ; he seemed to feel a rock under his feet ; it was the soliditas Cathedræ Petri . 
He went on kneeling , as if he were already in heaven , with the throne of God before him , and Angels around ; and as if to move were to lose his privilege . 
At length he felt a light hand on his shoulder , and a voice said , `` Reding , I am going ; let me just say farewell to you before I go . '' 
`` What a joy , Reding ! '' 
`` Oh , '' said Charles , `` what shall I say ? 
''' `` You , dear Reding , '' said Father Aloysius , `` have keen fresh feelings ; mine are blunted by familiarity . '' 
''' Reding took Father Aloysius 's hand , and kissed it ; as he sank on his knees , the young priest made the sign of blessing over him .
