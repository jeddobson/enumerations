BENEDICT ARNOLD . 
That child was - Benedict Arnold - . 
Now , mother of Arnold , look from Heaven and weep ! 
Forty-five years ago , you laid your child upon the sacramental altar of this church , and now he stands in yonder steeple , drinking in with a calm joy , the terrible cries of old men , and trembling women , and little children , hewn down in hideous murder , before his very eyes . 
At last , the cries are stilled in death ; the last flash of the burning town glares over the steeple , and there , attired in that scarlet uniform , his bronzed face stamped with the conflict of hideous passions -- there , smiling still amid the scenes of ruin and blood , stands - Benedict Arnold - . 
Orphans bless the name of Arnold ? 
While they sate there , hungry and cold , no fire on the hearth , not a crust of bread upon the table , their eyes fixed upon the tearful face of the good woman who gave them the shelter of a roof , a letter came , and in its folds five hundred dollars from Benedict Arnold . 
This at the very moment when he was steeling his soul to the guilt of Treason . 
This at the moment when his fortune had been scattered in banquets and pageants -- when assailed by clamorous creditors , he was ready to sell his soul for gold . 
From the last wreck of his fortune , all that had been left from the parasites who fed upon him , while they could , and then stung the hand that fed them , he took five hundred dollars and sent them to the children of his comrade , the patriot Warren . 
Then , at the awful hour when Arnold 's soul went up to judgment , did the prayer 's of Warren 's orphan children go up there , and like Angels , plead for him with - God - . 
The course of this strange history , will lead us to look upon two men : First , a brave and noble man , whose hand was firm as his heart was true , at once a Knight worthy of the brightest days of chivalry , and a Soldier beloved by his countrymen ; honored by the friendship of Washington -- that man , -- - Benedict Arnold - . 
Then , a bandit and an outcast , a man panoplied in hideous crimes , so dark , so infamous , that my tongue falters as it speaks his name -- - Benedict Arnold - . 
But now , that I have learned the fearful lesson of this life , let me frankly confess , that in the pages of history or fiction , there is no tragedy to compare with the plain history of Benedict Arnold . 
Through its every page , aye from the smiling autumnal landscape of Kenebec , from the barren rock of Quebec , or the green heights of Hudson , there glooms one horrid phantom , with a massive forehead and deep-set eyes , the Lucifer of the story -- Benedict Arnold . 
The man who can read his life , in all its details , without tears , has a heart harder than the roadside flint . 
One word in regard to the infancy of Arnold . 
One of these Deformed children lurks in the current life of Arnold . 
It is the grave story of the youth of Benedict , being passed away in various precocious atrocities . 
He strewed the road with pounded glass , in order that other little boys might cut their feet ; he fried frogs upon a bakeiron heated to an incredible intensity ; he geared flies in harness , decapitated grasshoppers , impaled `` Katy-dids . '' 
Why did he not pursue the subject , and state that at the age of two years , Benedict Arnold was deeply occupied in the pursuit of Latin , Sanscript , Hebrew , Moral Philosophy and the Philosopher 's stone ? 
In our research into Arnold 's life , we must bear one important fact in mind . 
- After he had betrayed his country , it was deemed not only justifiable to chronicle every blot and spec in his character , but highly praiseworthy to tumble the overflowing inkstand of libel upon every vestige of his name - . 
That he comes down to our time , with a single good deed adhering to his memory , has always seemed miraculous to me . 
`` Arnold , '' cried a patriotic citizen , uncouth in attire and speech : `` We are willing to fight the Britishers , but the city council wo n't let us have any guns ! '' 
Two figures stand in the shadows of the fortress gate ; in that stern determined visage , you see the first of the green mountain boys , stout - Ethan Allen - ; in that muscular figure , with the marked face and deep-set eye , you recognize the druggist of New Haven , - Benedict Arnold - . 
Or perchance in the name of Benedict Arnold and stout Ethan Allen ? 
-- That was the first deed of Benedict Arnold ; the initial letter to a long alphabet of glorious deeds , which was to end in the blackness of Treason . 
That was a great deed , the crossing of the Alps , by the young man , Napoleon , but I will now tell you a bolder deed , done by the Patriot , - Benedict Arnold - . 
In April , 1775 , that man Arnold stood behind a counter , mixing medicines , pasting labels on phials , and putting poisons in their places . 
In May , the Druggist Arnold , stood beside stout Ethan Allen , in the gate of conquered Ticonderoga . 
In September , the soldier Arnold was on his way to Quebec , through an untrodden desert of three hundred miles . 
That soldier was Benedict Arnold . 
Washington took him by the hand , and bade him go ! 
Washington did not fight for a Half-America , or a Piece-America , but for the Continent , the whole - Continent - . 
In one word , Washington and his compatriots were impressed with the belief that God had given the whole Continent to the Free . 
Therefore , pressing Arnold 's hand , he bade him God speed ! 
And he did go . 
That fleet , sailing on the 17th of September , 1775 , contains eleven hundred brave men , and their leader , Benedict Arnold . 
But in the day when Arnold dared its solitudes , there was a grandeur stamped on these rocks and cliffs -- a grandeur fresh from the hands of God . 
That canoe contains the oarsmen , and another form , wrapped in a rough cloak , with his head drooped on the breast , while the eye flashes with deep thoughts -- the form of the Napoleon of the wilderness , - Benedict Arnold - . 
Look ! 
He rises in the canoe -- he stands erect -- he flings the cloak from his form -- he lifts the rough fur cap from his brow . 
`` The Dark-Eagle comes to claim the wilderness , '' he speaks in the wild Indian tongue , which Arnold knows so well . 
In joy or sorrow , in battle or council , in honor or treason , Arnold never forgot the words of Natanis . 
He joins that little fleet ; he advances with Arnold into the Wilderness . 
Let us follow him there ! 
Now dashing down boiling rapids , now carrying their canoes through miles of forest , over hills of rock , now wading for long leagues , through water that freezes to their limbs as they go , the little army of Arnold advance . 
On , brave Arnold , on ! 
On , brave Arnold , on ! 
Under the shadow of this mountain the little army of Arnold encamped for three days . 
`` Arnold ! '' 
Benedict Arnold then takes from his breast , -- where wrapped in close folds he had carried it , through all his dreary march -- a blue banner gleaming with thirteen stars . 
On , brave Arnold , on ! 
The men of Arnold are here , encamped around yonder deserted Indian wigwam , whose rude timbers you may behold among the trees , near the brink of the waters . 
Now let us follow them again ; let us speak to brave Arnold , and bid him on ! 
O , these forests are dark and dense , these rocks are too terrible for us to climb , the cold chills our blood , this want of bread maddens our brain -- but still brave Arnold points toward Quebec , and bids them on ! 
It is day ; but the corn is gone -- we hunger , Arnold ! 
At last two long months of cold , starvation and death are past ; Arnold stands on Point Levy , and there , over the waters , sees rising into light the rock and spires of Quebec ! 
Napoleon gazing on the plains of Italy , Cortez on the Halls of Montezuma , never felt such joy as throbbed in Arnold 's bosom then ! 
At last he beheld -- - Quebec - ! 
That muscular form , with a hunting shirt thrown over his breast , that form standing there , with folded arms and head drooped low , while the eye glares out from beneath the fanning brow , that is the Patriot Hero of the Wilderness , Benedict Arnold . 
By his side stands a graceful form , with strength and beauty mingled in its outlines , clad in the uniform of a General , while that chivalrous countenance with its eye of summer blue , turns anxiously from face to face . 
He has come from Montreal , he has joined his little band with the Iron Men of Benedict Arnold . 
Arnold turns to his brothers in arms . 
`` Arnold ! '' 
-- Look there , and behold the two divisions , separating over the rocks : this , with Montgomery towards the St. Lawrence , that with Arnold and Morgan , towards the St. Charles . 
At the head of the column , with his drawn sword gleaming through the night , Benedict Arnold silently advances . 
Arnold can now count the cannon -- nay , the soldiers who are watching there . 
Arnold silently turns to his men . 
There wait the sentinel and his brother soldiers . 
Now the sentinel starts up from his reclining posture ; he hears that stealthy tread . 
He springs to his cannon -- look ! 
There disclosed by that cannon flash , long lines of bold riflemen start into view , and there -- Standing in front of the cannon , his tall form rising in the red glare , with a sword in one hand , the Banner of the Stars in the other -- there , with that wild look which he ever wore in battle , gleaming from his eye -- there stands the patriot , Benedict Arnold ! 
On either side there is a mangled corse -- but he stands firm . 
Before him yawns the cannon , but he springs upon those cannon -- he turns to his men -- he bids them on ! 
Now Arnold is in his glory ! 
Now he knows nothing , sees nothing but that grim barrier frowning yonder ! 
Those fires flashing from the houses -- that rattling hail of bullets pattering on the snow -- he sees , he feels them not ! 
His eye is fixed upon the second barrier . 
He glances around that mass of rifles , now glittering in the red light -- he floats the Banner of the Stars on high -- Hark to his shout ! 
Arnold stands victorious upon that barrier -- stands there , with blood upon his face , his uniform -- dripping from his sword -- stands there with the Banner of the Stars in his hand ! 
sainted mother of Arnold , who on that calm summer night , near forty years ago , laid your child upon the sacramental altar , now look from Heaven , and -- if saints pray for the children of earth -- then pray that your son may die here upon the bloody barrier of Quebec ! 
- Even as Arnold stood there , brandishing that starry banner , a soldier rushed up to his side , and with horror quivering on his lip , told that the gallant Montgomery had fallen . 
Leaving Arnold for a moment , on the first barrier of Quebec , let us trace the footsteps of his brother-hero . 
Arnold stood upon the first barrier , while his heart throbbed at the story of Montgomery 's fate . 
Then that expression of desperation , which few men could look upon without fear , came over Arnold 's face . 
Now look at him , as with his form swelling with rage he rushes on ! 
He springs from that barrier , he shouts to the iron men , he rings the name of Morgan on the air . 
`` Montgomery is there , '' he shouts , in a voice of thunder , `` there waiting for us ! '' 
At their head , his whole form convulsed , his lips writhing , his chest heaving unconscious of danger , as though the ghost of Montgomery was there before him , Benedict Arnold rushes on ! 
Even as he rushes , he falls . 
Even as you look upon him , in his battle rage with his right leg shattered , he falls . 
But does he give up the contest ? 
Then the names of Arnold and Montgomery , mingled in one breath , would have been joined forever , in one song of immortality . 
Arnold lived ; his ashes accursed by his countrymen , rest in an unknown grave . 
When the news of the gallant attack on Quebec -- gallant though unsuccessful -- reached Philadelphia , the Congress rewarded Benedict Arnold with the commission of a Brigadier General . 
The same mob , who , afterwards -- while Arnold was yet true to his country -- stoned him in the streets , and stoned the very arm that had fought for them , now cracked their throats in shouting his name . 
The very city , which afterwards was the scene of his Dishonorable Persecution , now flashed out from its illuminated casements , glory of the Hero of Quebec , - Benedict Arnold - . 
Ah , then the stout heart of Arnold quailed . 
Ah , then as the noble horse stooped his arching neck , as if to invite his master to mount him once again , and rush on to meet the foe , then Arnold who never turned his face away from foe , turned his face away from the large speaking eye of that horse , Lucifer . 
Arnold who never shed a tear for the dead men in battle , felt his eyes grow wet . 
He was about to shoot that friend , who had served him so well , and never betrayed him . 
And Arnold looked back , and beheld the dying head of his horse faintly upraised ; he beheld that large eye rolling in death . 
Let us pass over those brilliant exploits on Lake Champlain , which made the Continent ring with the name of Arnold . 
The records of history give the lie to this charge of mercenary business , for when Arnold seized the goods , he wrote to his commanding general and to Congress , that he was about to seize certain stores in Montreal for the public benefit . 
Let us go to the hall of Congress , and see this Spirit of Party , the Apeand-Viper God , which burdened the heart of Washington , more than all the terror of British bayonets or scaffolds , first manifested in the case of Arnold . 
-- In February , 1777 , Congress created five Major Generals , over the head of Benedict Arnold . 
All of these were his juniors ; one of them was from the militia . 
He wrote a manly and soothing letter to Arnold . 
He knew him to be a man of many good and some evil qualities , all marked and prominent . 
Therefore , Washington , the Father of his Country , wrote a letter , at once high-toned and conciliating , to the Patriot , Benedict Arnold . 
What was the course of Arnold ? 
He expostulated with the party in Congress , who wished to drive him mad . 
How did he expostulate ? 
In his own fiery way . 
Like many stout souls of that Iron time , he spoke a better language with his sword than with his pen . 
Let us look at the expostulation of Arnold . 
Yonder on those high rocks , near the town of Ridgefield , Arnold , with only 500 men , disputes the path of the Destroyer . 
Ths Continentals are driven back after much carnage , but Arnold is the last man to leave the rock . 
His horse is shot under him ; the British surround him , secure of their prey ; the dismounted General sits calmly on his dying steed , his arms folded , his eye sunk beneath the compressed brow . 
Arnold beholds him , beholds the wall of bayonets and faces that encircle him . 
The soldier extends his hand to grasp the prisoner , when Arnold , smiling calmly , draws his pistol and shoots the hireling through the heart . 
Follow him yonder , as he fights his way down the rock , through the breasts of his foes . 
Had Arnold always expostulated thus , his name would not now be the Hyperbole of scorn . 
When Congress received the news of this Expostulation , Arnold was raised to the rank of Major General . 
Yet still , they left the date of his commission , below the date of the commissions of the other five Major Generals . 
Ere we pass on to the Battle-Day of Saratoga , let me tell you an incident of strange interest , which took place in 1777 , during Arnold 's command near Fort Edward , on the Hudson River . 
Benedict Arnold was not in the battle at all , if we may believe in the bulletin of Gates , for his name is not even mentioned there . 
Yet I have a strange story to tell you , concerning the very battle , which supported as it is , by the solemn details of history , throws a strange light on the career of Benedict Arnold . 
He remembered the contest of the 19th , when Benedict Arnold , at the head of certain bold riflemen , carried the day , before all the glitter of British arms ; and now -- perchance -- a fear seized him , that this 7th of October might be a dark day , for Arnold was not there . 
They had quarrelled , Arnold and Gates , about some matter of military courtesy ; the former was now without a commission ; the latter commanded , alone , and now would have to win glory for himself with his own hands . 
Even those bold riflemen , who were in the wilderness with one Benedict Arnold , who stormed the walls of Quebec , with this Arnold and Montgomery , on that cold daybreak of December thirty-first , 1775 , even those men of iron fell back , terrified at the sight . 
That wound was received at the Storming of Quebec ; that Rider of the Black Horse was - Benedict Arnold - . 
- '' He found him at last , but it was in the gate of the fortress , on the body of the dead steed , bleeding from his wound , that he discovered the face of Benedict Arnold , the Victor of Behmus Heights . 
- General Gates , in his bulletin of the battle , did not mention the name of - - Benedict Arnold - ! 
Methinks , even now , I see the same Horatio flying from the bloody field of Camden -- where an army was annihilated -- his hair turning white as snow , as he pursues his terrible flight , without once resting for eighty miles -- methinks I hear him call for another Arnold , to WIN THIS BATTLE , AS - Saratoga was won - ! 
The conduct of Arnold in this battle became known , in spite of the dastardly opposition of his enemies , and -- says a distinguished and honest historian -- Congress relented at this late hour with an ill-grace , and sent him a commission , giving him the full rank which he claimed . 
He was now in truth , crowned as he stood , with the laurels of the Wilderness , Quebec and Saratoga , - Major General Arnold - , of the Continental Army . 
At the same time that George Washington received the account of Arnold 's daring at Saratoga , he also received from a Nobleman of France , three splendid sets of epaulettes and sword-knots , with the request to retain one for himself , and bestow the others on the two bravest men of his army . 
George Washington sent one set of epaulettes with a sword-knot to Benedict Arnold . 
When we next look for Arnold , we find him confined to his room , with a painful wound . 
For the entire winter the limb which had been first broken at Quebec , broken again at Saratoga , kept him a prisoner in the close confinement of his chamber . 
Then let us behold him entering New Haven , in triumph as the Hero of Saratoga . 
-- In this hour of Arnold 's triumph , when covered with renown , he comes back to his childhood 's home , may we not imagine his Mother looking from Heaven upon the glory of her child ? 
Yes , sainted Mother of Arnold , who long years ago , laid your babe upon the sacramental altar , baptized with the tears and prayers of a Mother 's agony , now look from heaven , and pray to God that he may die , with all his honorable wounds about him ! 
- Let - us look for Arnold again ! 
We will find him passing through the streets of old Philadelphia , in his glittering coach , with six splendid horses , and liveried outriders ; riding in state as the Governor of Philadelphia . 
In the dim and solemn aisle of Christ Church , at the sunset hour , behold a new and touching scene in the life of Benedict Arnold . 
And in the deep serenity of this evening hour -- while the same glow of sunshine gilds the white monuments in yonder graveyard , and reveals the faces of the wedding guests -- Benedict Arnold , in the prime of a renowned manhood , having seen thirty-eight years of life , in all its phases -- on the ocean , in battle , amid scenes of blood and death -- links his fate forever with that queenly girl , whose romance and passion in love of power , are written in two emphatic words -- - beautiful and eighteen ! 
Does the the wife of Benedict Arnold , looking through a dark and troubled future , behold the darkness dissipated by the sunshine of a Royal Court ? 
Does she -- with that young breast heaving with impatient ambition -- already behold Arnold the Patriot , transformed into Arnold the Courtier -- and Traitor ? 
We must look at Arnold now , as by this marriage and his important position -- the Military Commander of the greatest city on the Continent -- he is brought into contact with a proud and treacherous aristocracy -- as he feasts , as he drinks , as he revels with them . 
From that hour , date his ruin . 
This Tory aristocracy existed in full vigor , at the time Arnold assumed the command in Philadelphia . 
You will observe that his position was one of singular difficulty ; Washington himself would not have given general satisfaction , had he been in Arnold 's place . 
In after time , Jackson at New Orleans , excited the enmity of a bitter faction , because he held the same power , which Arnold once exercised -- that of a Military Governor , who commands in the same town with a Civil Magistracy . 
From their prominence , as well as from his marriage with Miss Shippen , Arnold was thrown into constant intimacy with these pliable politicians . 
Having grounded these facts well in your minds , you will be prepared to hear the grumbling of these newly-pledged patriots , when Arnold -- who yesterday was such a splendid fellow , sprinkling his gold in banquets and festivals -- obeyed a Resolution of the Continental Congress , and by proclamation , prohibited the sale of all goods , in the city , until it was ascertained whether any of the property belonged to the King of Great Britain or his subjects . 
Therefore , they opened their batteries of malignancy and calumniation against Arnold . 
Where he was guilty of one wrong act , they charged him with a thousand . 
Not seven months of Arnold 's command had transpired , before Congress and Washington were harrassed with letters asking for the trial and disgrace of Arnold . 
At last the matter was brought before Congress , and a Committee of that body , after a thorough examination , gave to Benedict Arnold , `` a vindication from any criminalty in the matters charged against him . '' 
Then the war was opened against Arnold anew ; then the Mob -- not the mechanics or men of toil -- but the Rabble who do no work , and yet have time to do all the riots in your large cities , were taught to hoot his name in scorn , to stone him in the streets , him , the Hero of Quebec . 
Yes , the out-casts of the city , were taught to cover him with filth , to wound with their missiles , the very limb that had been broken by a cannon ball , on the barrier of Quebec . 
It was done , the day fixed , but the accusers of Arnold were not ready for trial . 
All the while , these men were darkening the character of Arnold , all the while he stood before the world in the light of an untried CRIMINAL . 
At last the day came -- Arnold was tried -- and after a month consumed in the careful examination of witnesses and papers , was found guilty of two colossal enormities . 
Before we look at them , let us remember , that his accusers , on this occasion , were General Joseph Reed , and other members of the Supreme Executive council of Pennsylvania . 
For this Benedict Arnold had been pursued for at least thirteen months , with a malignity insatiable as the blood-hounds thirst . 
For this he had been held up to all the world as a criminal , for this pelted in the streets , and for this , the Hero of Quebec and Saratoga and Champlain , was to be publicly disgraced , REPRIMANDED by - George Washington - . 
At the same time that we admit that Arnold was betrayed into serious faults through his intimacy with the Tory aristocracy of Philadelphia , as well as from the inherent rashness of his character -- that very rashness forming one of the elements of his iron-souled bravery -- we must also admit , that among the most prominent of his accusers or persecutors , as you please , -- was `` - a man whose foot had once been lifted to take the step which Arnold afterwards took - . '' 
In the public papers I have repeated the statement , expressing my readiness to meet any person , in a frank and searching discussion of the question -- - Was Arnold 's chief accuser in heart a Traitor ? 
For example , when following the finger of history , I awarded to Arnold the glory of Saratoga , a very respectable but decidedly anonymous critic , brought all his artillery to bear upon a line , which had a reference to the - preparation of buckwheat cakes ! 
- So , when I expressed my readiness to examine the character of Arnold 's - chief accuser , a very prominent individual , who has made that accuser 's deeds the subject of laborious and filial panegyric , instead of meeting the question like a man , crept away into some dark corner of history , and called a sincere patriot by the portentous name of -- Infidel ! 
Having therefore , repeatedly stated that I was ready to give a careful and impartial investigation of the history of Arnold 's chief accuser , I will now enter upon the subject as a question comprised within the limits of legitimate history . 
Is it not reasonable to suppose , that the man who took upon himself the work of crushing Benedict Arnold , must have been a very good citizen , a very sincere patriot , and if not a great warrior , at least a very honest statesman ? 
Remember -- this trial and disgrace of Arnold , was the main cause of his treason -- and then dispute our right to search the character of his Accuser , if you can . 
`` Benedict Arnold ! '' 
If these answers , which the Ghost of Washington whispers from every page of history , be true , it follows that General John Cadwallader is an impartial witness in this case , and that Benedict Arnold was a sincere Patriot in the winter of 1776 . 
The adjutant general of the Continental army , to whom Washington had entrusted duties , involving , in their faithful performance , the well-being , perchance the existence of that army , remarked to General Cadwallader : `` - That he did not understand following the fortunes of a broken-down and shattered army - -- '' At the very moment that he said this , Benedict Arnold was out yonder , on the brink of the ice-bound river , assisting with his heart and hand , the movements of George Washington . 
The evidence which he produced in his published pamphlet , was a thousand times stronger than that which stripped the laurel from Arnold 's brow . 
This adjutant general , was General - Joseph Reed - , President of the Supreme Council of Pennsylvania , and the prominent accuser of - Benedict Arnold - . 
In his defence before the Court Martial , Arnold used these words : -- `` I can with boldness say to my persecutors in general , and to the chief of them in particular -- that in the hour of danger , when the affairs of America wore a gloomy aspect , when our illustrious general was retreating through America , with a handful of men , I did not propose to my associates basely to quit the General , and sacrifice the cause of my country to my personal safety , by going over to the enemy , and making my peace . '' 
That man Arnold , brave and proud as Lucifer , standing among the generals , beside whom he had fought and bled -- standing the centre of all eyes , in the place of the Criminal , with the eye of Washington fixed upon him in reproof -- with a throng of the meaner things of the Revolution , whom the British King might have bought , had he thought them worth the buying , grouped about him ; these petty men -- who had been warming themselves at comfortable fires , while the hands of Arnold were freezing on the ramparts of Quebec -- exulting at his disgrace , glorying in his shame , chuckling at his fall -- It was too much for Arnold . 
That moment the iron entered his soul , and festered there . 
From that moment he stood resolved in his work of treason . 
From that moment his country lost a soldier , history one of her brightest names , Washington his right-hand man , the Revolution its bravest Knight . 
In one word , from that moment John Andre lost his life , Benedict Arnold his honor ; Sir Henry Clinton gained a -- Traitor . 
-- It was indeed , too much for Arnold . 
Exhibit again those splendid qualities , which have placed you in the rank of our most distinguished generals - '' -- These were the words of Washington , worthy of his hero-heart , but from that moment , Arnold the Patriot was dead . 
At that instant from the terrible chaos of dark thoughts , wounded pride , lacerated honor , sprung into birth a hideous phantom , known by history as -- Arnold the Traitor . 
Had he but taken the advice of Washington , had he but looked derision upon his foes ! 
Raising himself in all his proud height , his eye blazing with that stern fire which lighted up his bronzed face on the ramparts of Quebec , his voice deep , hollow , ringing with the accents of scorn , he should have spoken to his enemies words like these : `` Look ! 
But he failed to do this . 
Unlike Jackson , who covered with the glory of New Orleans , rested patiently for thirty years , under the odium of an unjust fine , Arnold did not possess the power -- - to live down persecution - . 
In order to understand the scene of his reprimand in all its details , we must wander back through the shadows of seventy years . 
That of course , is Arnold . 
Arnold hears it , all -- every word of that solemn Reprimand . 
Does his cheek blench ? 
His eye change its fixed glance ? 
As those words fall from the lips of Washington , he merely suffers his head to droop slowly downward , until his eyes seem glaring upward , from compressrd brows . 
-- Meanwhile , looking between Washington and Arnold , do you see that figure , resting one arm upon the mantel-piece , while his face is turned away , and his eyes seem earnestly perusing the hot coals of the fire ? 
Behold that glance of Arnold , shooting its scorn from the woven eye-brows , and answer the question , every heart for itself . 
Arnold raises his head , surveys the whole company , first , Washington , with a look of deep respect , then the warrior faces of his brothers in arms , and last of all , that figure by the fireside . 
The flame light falls upon Arnold 's brow , and reveals him , very calm , somewhat pale , but utterly Resolved . 
So , taking for granted , that his enemies , who had hunted him for thirteen months , were present at the scene of his disgrace -- do I , in my own mind , delineate this picture of the Past . 
-- - Aged - persons , survivors of the Revolution , have told me singular and impressive stories of Arnold 's appearance and demeanor , while in Philadelphia , after this trial . 
And when the Mob stoned him , he never looked back , but patiently received their missiles in his face , and on his wounded limb . 
They tell me , that his features , swarthy and battle-worn , lost every trace of vivacity : they were rigidly fixed ; the lips compressed , the brow calm and unfrowning , wore an expression that no one could read , while his eyes had a wildness in their gleam , a fire in their glance , that told somewhat of the supernatural struggle at work within him , the Battle between Arnold 's Revenge and Arnold 's Pride . 
At this time , he brings to mind the Hebrew Giant , Sampson . 
Yes , Arnold imagined that his pursuers had put out the eyes of his honor , and shorn off the locks of his strength . 
He fancied himself brought forth before all America , to make sport for the tricksters and trimmers , in Camp and Congress -- the cowardly Philistines of that heroic time . 
His fall had been determined with himself , but he also , resolved that the ruins which were to crush him should neither be small nor insignificant . 
He was to fall , but he would drag down the temple with him . 
The Ruin should be great and everlasting . 
He would carve out for himself , a monument of eternal infamy , from the rock of his patriot greatness . 
Look yonder , my friends , into the retirement of Arnold 's home . 
It is almost a Palace , this beautiful place of - Landsdowne - , which once occupied by the Penn family , is now the retreat of Benedict Arnold . 
Here , amid these beautiful woods , he hides his sorrow . 
Here , along these gravelled walks , beneath the shade of overhanging trees , he paces all day long . 
Sometimes he gazes on the distant rocks of Laurel Hill . 
Sometimes he strays by the Schuylkill , and its clear waters mirror his face , lowering with fearful passions . 
At times , secluding himself in these silent chambers , he utters certain words in a low voice . 
-- Fancy the lion of the forest , captured , tied , his limbs , severed one by one , and you have the case of Benedict Arnold . 
It was when Arnold , recently appointed General in command of Philadelphia , received the French Minister , Monsieur Gerard . 
How often Arnold would stand in the shadow , gazing upon her as she went to and fro , and thinking that all this treasure of warm loveliness , this world of enticing beauty , was his own ! 
His wife , his newly-married Bride ! 
Then , the celebrated Arnold , surrounded by parasites ; now the disgraced Arnold , living alone in these shades , in company with his wife . 
Does she tell him how much nobler will be Arnold the Patriot , enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen , than Arnold the Courtier , dancing attendance in the ante-chamber of King George ? 
I make no charge against the wife of Arnold . 
Had she , instead of a King-worshipper , a lover of titles and courts and shows , been a Hero-woman , Arnold might have been saved . 
But he loved her . 
She clung to him in his disgrace . 
When the world frowned , her bosom received his burning brow , and pillowed his torn heart . 
She was with him in his loneliness . 
Was it strange , that her voice whispering to him at all hours , should sway his soul with a powerful , nay , an irresistable influence ? 
Imagine him neglected by Congress , disgraced in the camp , pelted in the streets , striding to his home , his heart beating against his breast , like a lion in its cage . 
There , in his Home , a beautiful girl welcomes him . 
She may have married him because he was so renowned , because he bore his honors with so proud a grace , but - now - , she is Home , Friend , World to him . 
Is it improbable that Arnold was fatally swayed by the words of this bewitching wife ? 
Again I repeat , had this wife , instead of a lover of courts and pomps and names , been a Hero-Woman , her heart true to the cause of freedom , her soul beating warmly for Washington and his cause , there would never have been written , on the adamantine column which towers from history -- dedicated to the memory of Infamous Men -- the name of -- - Benedict Arnold - . 
- The influence of his wife was one of the main causes of Arnold 's treason - . 
How did she influence his life ? 
It was in the Home , at the Fireside , that the wife of Arnold exercised her bewitching and fatal power ! 
-- Let us now , in one historical picture , condense three important points of Arnold 's career . 
-- - There - was a night , when an awful agony was passing in the breast of Arnold ; the struggle between Arnold 's revenge and Arnold 's pride . 
You have all seen that old house , in Second near Walnut street , which once the Home of William Penn , once the Palace of Benedict Arnold , is now used as a manufactory of Venus De Medicis , and sugar candies . 
And there , with his back to that fire , -- there , looking out upon the western sky , gleaming in deep starlight , stood Benedict Arnold . 
One hand was laid upon his breast , which throbbed in long deep gasps ; the other held two letters . 
That is the struggle between Arnold the Patriot , and Arnold the Traitor . 
For now the wife of Arnold is waiting for the determination of her husband 's fate ; now , the darkest shadow is passing over the Dial-plate of his destiny . 
While Arnold stands brooding there , while his wife sits trembling by the fire -- without , in the ante-chamber , three persons wait for him . 
- He - has come here to listen to the offer of Arnold , who wishes to enter the service of the French King . 
He has come from the wilds of the forest in the far northwest , to hearken to the answer of Arnold -LRB- the - Death Eagle - , as the Indians call him , -RRB- to their proposition , by which they agree to make him chief of their tribes . 
Now look : the door opens ; the three enter ; Arnold turns and beholds them . 
While the wife of Arnold sits trembling by the fire , he advances , and greets the Chevalier De Luzerne : `` Look ye , '' he mutters in quick tones , `` Your king can have my sword , but mark ! 
Stung to the quick with this cool insult , Arnold -- turning his eyes away from the British Spy -- salutes the Indian chief -- hark ! 
`` Yet are they afraid , that he loves the pale faces too well -- '' `` Try my love for the pale faces , '' -- mutters Arnold with a look and a sneer that makes even the red Indian start . 
was the hoarse response of Arnold , given with knit brows , and clenched hands . 
Then it was that Arnold -- who had embraced with a gleam of savage delight , the proposition , to become the chief of a murderous tribe of wild Indians -- felt his heart grow cold ! 
Arnold who in his mad revenge , was willing to sweep the towns of the whites with torch and knife , quailed at the idea of leaving that fair young wife . 
`` The Death Eagle can not be your chief ! '' 
he said as he turned from the Indian . 
gasped Arnold , placing the fatal letter in the hands of the British Spy . 
And then Arnold and his wife were alone . 
Then that wife -- gazing on the noble countenance of her husband , now livid as ashes , -- gazing in that dark eye , now wild and rolling in its glance , -- gazing on that white lip , that quivered like a dry leaf -- then that wife of Arnold trembled as she felt that the dread Rubicon was passed , that Arnold , the Patriot , - dead - , she sat in the presence of - Arnold , the Traitor - . 
A dark cavern , where no light shines , save the taper flashing from the eyes of hollow skull -- a lonely waste where rude granite rocks tossed in fantastic forms , deepen the midnight horror of the hour -- the crash of battle , where ten thousand living men in one moment , are crushed into clay -- such are the scenes which the Romancer chooses for the illustration of his Tragedy , the Historian for his storied page , every line full of breathing interest and life . 
That the awful tragedy of Arnold 's treason , should find its development at a -- Breakfast-table ! 
But - Treason - calmly sitting down to a quiet breakfast , the pleasant smile upon his face , hiding the canker of his heart , the coffee -- that fragrant intensifier of the brain -- smoking like sweet incense , as it imparts its magnetism from the lip to the soul -- Treason with a wife on one side , a baby laughing on his knee ! 
Yet among them all , that Development of Arnold 's Treason , which took place at a Breakfast-table , has ever seemed to us most terrible . 
Arnold is silent . 
Ever and again from the shadows of his deep drawn brows , he gazes upon her , his wife ! 
How much has he risked for them ! 
Shall he be the heir of Arnold the Earl ? 
Does she the child of wealth and luxury , lapped from her birth in soft attire , for a moment fancy that Arnold himself , was once a friendless babe , pressed to the agonized bosom of a poor and pious woman ? 
You know we are engaged to breakfast at General Arnold 's head-quarters ? '' 
Our visit to Hartford , was a remarkably pleasant one -- By the bye , General , '' -- turning abruptly to Arnold -- `` What think you of the rumor now afloat , in reference to West Point ? '' 
The porcelain cup , about to touch Arnold 's lip , was suddenly stopped in its progress . 
As the sunlight pours in uncertain gleams over his forehead , you can see a strange gloom overshadow his face . 
West Point ? '' 
he echoed in his deep voice . 
`` Yes -- '' hesitated the aid-de-camp -- `` On our way home , we heard something of an intended attack on West Point , by Sir Henry Clinton -- '' The smile that came over Arnold 's face , was remembered for many a day , by those who saw it . 
Never had the wife of Arnold appeared so beautiful . 
Arnold was silent all the while . 
said Arnold , quietly sipping his coffee , while his eye assumed a deeper light , and the muscles of his face suddenly contracted , -- `` From whom is that letter ? '' 
Arnold took the letter , broke the seal , and calmly read it . 
Calmly , although every word was fire , although the truth which it contained , was like a voice from the grave , denouncing eternal woe upon his head . 
You can see the wife centre her anxious gaze upon his face . 
Still he is calm . 
There is one deep respiration heaving his broad chest , beneath his General 's uniform , one dark shadow upon his face . 
-- as terrible as it is brief -- and then , arising with composed dignity , he announces , that sudden intelligence required his immediate attendance at West Point . 
`` Tell General Washington when he arrives , that I am unexpectedly called to West Point , but will return very soon . '' 
Arnold stands by the window , with the morning light upon his brow . 
She totters towards him . 
For a moment he gazes upon her in silence . 
She does not breathe a word , but trembling to him , as though unconscious of the action , lifts her babe before his eyes . 
`` Wife -- '' he exclaimed , in a voice that was torn from his very heart -- `` All is lost ! '' 
He flung his manly arms about her form -- one pressure of his bosom , one kiss upon her lips -- he seizes the babe , kisses it with wild frenzy , flings it upon the bed , and rushes from the room . 
Then the wife of Arnold spread forth her arms , as though she stood on the verge of an awful abyss , and with her eyes swimming in wild light , fell heavily to the floor . 
Arnold hurries down the stairs , passes through the drawing room , mounts the saddled horse at the door , and dashes toward the river . 
Ah , far over the waters , she gazes on that figure ; she can not distinguish the features of that distant face , but her heart tells her that it is -- - Arnold - ! 
-- In the history of ages , I know no picture so full of interest , as this -- The Wife of Arnold , gazing from the window of her home , upon the barge , which bears her Husband to the shelter of the British flag ! 
He was told that Arnold had been called suddenly to West Point . 
After a hurried breakfast , he resolved to cross the river , and meet his General at the fortress . 
After this interview it was his purpose to return to dinner . 
Washington gazed upon the sublime cliffs all around him , upon the smooth expanse of water , which rested like a mirror , in its mountain frame , and then gaily exclaimed : `` I am glad that General Arnold has preceded us . 
Doubtles , Arnold was preparing some pleasant surprise . 
Is Arnold not here ? '' 
`` He has not been here within two days , nor have I heard from him within that time ! '' 
-- The truth gentlemen , is plain -- General Arnold is a - Traitor - . 
He returned in the course of an hour , not with the Traitor , but with a letter headed `` His Majesty 's Ship , Vulture , Sept. 25 , 1780 , '' directed to Washington , and signed `` - Benedict Arnold - . '' 
The actors -- Washington and the wife of Arnold . 
she said , in a voice that brought tears to the eyes of Washington -- `` He has done no wrong ! 
Strange words these , but a glance convinced Washington , that the wife of Arnold stood before him , not calm and collected , but with the light of madness glaring from her blue eyes . 
She stood erect , regarding him with that blazing eye , that defiant look . 
What were the contents of the letter which Arnold received at the Breakfast table ? 
Was the Wife of Arnold a Partner in the work of Treason ? 
That man , the Hero of the Wilderness , whose glory had burst upon his country , with the bewildering splendor of the Aurora , which flushes the northern sky with dies of matchless beauty -- Benedict Arnold . 
General Arnold will not lightly overlook my detention , I assure you ! '' 
Artillery orders , showing how the garrison of West Point should be disposed of in case of an alarm ; an estimate of the force of the fortress ; an estimate of the number of men , requisite to man the works ; a return of the ordnance ; remarks on the strength and weakness of the various works , a report of a council of war lately at head quarters , concerning the campaign , which Washington had sent to Arnold -- such were the secrets of these papers , all in the undisguised hand writing of Benedict Arnold . 
-LSB- 11 -RSB- It now becomes our task to examine the contents of the letter which Arnold received at the Breakfast table . 
He could not imagine , that a General so renowned as Arnold was a Traitor . 
Next comes the question -- Was Arnold 's wife a Partner in the work of Treason ? 
Mr. H. states that Paulding wore a British uniform ; that Williams was despatched with a note to Arnold ; and that the prisoner was taken to Sing Sing , and from thence to Tappan , where - Washington arrived in a few minutes - . 
Not a word -LRB- on the trial of Andre , -RRB- was said by either Paulding or his comrades , in relation to the - departure of Williams with a note to Arnold - . 
The first scene took place when the British Army was in Philadelphia ; and while Benedict Arnold was confined to his room , in the city of New Haven , with the wounds of Saratoga . 
The other scene occurred more than two years afterwards , when Benedict Arnold was in command at West Point . 
That woman is now the wife of Benedict Arnold , who fled from West Point but a few brief days ago , in the British ship Vulture . 
- Yes , she has linked her fate with the destiny of Arnold . 
- In those letters , the first letters of Arnold to Clinton , signed Gustavus , and speaking Treason , were enclosed . 
While he hangs quivering on the gallows , yonder in New York , before a glittering mirror , stands Benedict Arnold , surveying his proud form , attired for the first time , in that hangman 's dress -- a scarlet uniform . 
Yonder -- even while the last tremor shakes his form -- yonder , alone , kneels George Washington , in prayer with his God . 
The contempt , which all honorable men feel for one who undertakes the lacquey work of Treason , and plays the part of a - Spy - , was lost in the unmeasured scorn which all men felt for Benedict Arnold . 
Her hand rests upon a letter , inscribed with the name of -- Benedict Arnold . 
It is the apartment of Benedict Arnold . 
He does not wield that sword , or wear that uniform any longer . 
He is a Traitor , and makes his home here in the city of New York , in this spacious mansion . 
Is this the wife of Arnold ? 
Is it his Ladye-love ? 
Say rather , as you behold the bosom torn by fiery passions , the eyes darting the magnetic rays of revenge , the dagger gleaming death from its keen blade , that this lovely woman waiting alone in his most secret chamber , is his - Executioner - ! 
`` Arnold ! 
There , slightly advanced from the shadows of the threshhold , stands -- the appalled form of Benedict Arnold ? 
She turns , and flinging the chapean aside , confronts the -- Wife of Arnold . 
Yes , the lady-love of John Andre , confronts the wife of his Evil Genius , Benedict Arnold . 
You will remember that this Wife , when a blooming virgin , once in the revelry of a Tournament , crowned John Andre with a chaplet of laurel and roses , that she corresponded with him some months after her marriage , that in her letters , the letters of Arnold to Sir Henry Clinton were enveloped , that -- perchance -- from her girlhood memories , -- perchance -- from deeper reasons -- he was dear to her heart ! 
Therefore , you will understand , that this meeting in the secret chamber of Arnold , was a strangely interesting scene . 
And as the Wife shrank back appalled , there commenced in that lonely chamber of Arnold , a scene of wild interest . 
Intercepted despatches of the enemy , which implicate one of our bravest general 's in the treason of Arnold ? '' 
Other Generals were preparing to follow the example of Arnold . 
On the 30th of September , Champe , was appointed one of Arnold 's recruiting sergeants . 
Behold him now , an efficient soldier of Arnold 's American Legion , dressed in a red uniform , and doing the work of a Briton . 
What would be Arnold 's course , in case Andre was put to death as a spy ? 
At the same hour , Benedict Arnold was writing in his most secret chamber , while his brother-traitor , John Champe , waited near his chair . 
The shaded lamp spread a circle over Arnold 's face and hand , while all around was twilight . 
Champe stood in the shadow behind the back of Arnold , his dark visage working with a peculiar expression . 
Arnold was just writing these words , when the door opened -- ` - If this warning shall be disregarded , and he suffer , I call Heaven and earth to witness , that your Excellency will be justly anwerable for the torrent of blood that may be spilt in consequence - . ' 
If Andre perishes -- '' As Arnold spoke , the door opened and a Soldier entered the room -- `` General , Major Andre was put to death at noon to-day ! '' 
Arnold gazed in the face of the Soldier , with a look of vacant astonishment . 
Arnold did not speak for five minutes . 
For that space of time , he sat in the chair , with his eyes fixed on the paper , but in truth he saw nothing . 
A hazy vapor swam before his sight , the sound of bells was in his ears . 
When he saw clearly again , the stupified soldier stood in the doorway , gazing upon the general in awe , for the agitation of that iron face was horrible to behold . 
Why , you weep like a child -- '' Arnold spoke in scorn , but took good care to keep his own eyes from the light . 
Arnold paced the room , now folding his arms , now clenching his hands , now uttering in a low voice , horrible blasphemies . 
`` Champe -- '' he said , abruptly pausing , as his distorted countenance glowed in the light -- `` They have known me in the Wilderness -- yes , at Quebec -- at Saratoga ; my sword has been tried , and it has crimsoned its blade in victory ! 
Now -- by -- '' he muttered a horrible oath , `` they shall know that sword once more , know it as the instrument of vengeance -- aye , they shall know it as the Avenger of John Andre ! '' 
Terrified , as though he beheld a fiend instead of a man , Champe slowly rose to his feet . 
Take care -- the Traitor Arnold will stand amid heaps of dead bodies , shouting as he plunges his sword into your soldiers ' hearts , This and This for John Andre ! 
Arnold stood erect , one hand laid upon his sword , while the other uplifted in the awful formality of an oath , attested the deep sincerity of his resolve . 
Here to welcome Benedict Arnold , in the garb of his victim ! 
`` O , do not -- do not speak of these memories -- '' gasped the wife of Arnold . 
-- Wife of Arnold , ask your heart -- nay , go to the river shore , and ask the sod of that lonely grave ! 
The Wife of Arnold sank on her knees . 
she cried , lifting her ashy face toward that beautiful woman , clad in the dress of John Andre -- `` Do not rend my heart with these words -- '' `` How died he , the young , the gifted , the brave ? '' 
-- You see that eye dart an almost demoniac fire -- `` Perchance in battle at the head of legions , his good steed beneath him , his true sword in hand ? 
Yes , charging into the thickest of the fight , he fell , his last smile glowing in the sunshine of victory ! 
Or , maybe he perished in some midnight massacre , perished in the act of an heroic defence ? 
There was no sword in his hand when he died . 
He died -- O , does it wring your heart -- with the rope about his neck , the vacant air beneath his feet . 
faltered the beautiful Wife of Arnold , her face now deathly pale -- `` Did I hurry him to this fatal death ? 
sneered the disguised maiden -- `` Mercy for the Wife of Benedict Arnold , who after her marriage suffered her letters to John Andre , to enclose the letters of the Traitor to Sir Henry Clinton ! 
Did you advise Benedict Arnold to make John Andre the tool of his Treason ? 
For the wife of Arnold knelt before her , her face upon her breast , her golden hair floating to the knees , which crouched upon the floor . 
I , a maiden whose good name no breath has ever dimmed , here in the chamber of Arnold ? 
`` But Washington can reach Arnold ! '' 
`` Yes , as Andre died , so Arnold shall die -- on the gibbet ! 
From this chamber , bound and dumb , Arnold shall be led this night . 
In the dark street trusty men are waiting for him , even now . 
Washington will not sleep to-night -- he expects a strange visitor , -- Benedict Arnold ! '' 
As though all life had fled from her veins , the Wife of Arnold glared in the face of the dark-haired woman . 
The Wife of Arnold made no reply . 
You see the Wife of Arnold start to her feet , her blue eye gleaming , while with her upraised arm she dashes back from her face those locks of golden hair . 
For she loved him , her Warrior-husband , that Wife of Arnold ; and now , with her entire frame quivering with a joy which was more intense , from the re-action of her despair , she beheld the schemes of her enemies crushed in a moment . 
But now , the Americans never speak of me , but to curse my name , in the same breath with Arnold ! '' 
Arnold escapes the hand of vengeance now . 
Now , flushed with triumph , he goes on to complete his career of blood . 
He will gather gold -- renown , aye , favor from the hands of his King . 
But in the hour of his proudest triumph , even when he stands beside the Throne , one form , invisible to all other eyes , will glide through the thronging courtiers , and wither him , with its pale face , its white neck polluted by the gibbet 's rope , its livid lip trembling with a muttered curse -- the Phantom of John Andre ! 
He will be known as the - Traitor Arnold - . 
`` Yes , when he dies -- while the Phantom of Andre glides to his side -- no hand of friend or foe shall be placed upon his brow , no one shall wait by his couch , no voice speak to him of Heaven or Hope , but in the utter desolation of a Blighted heart and a Doomed Name , shall depart the soul of the Traitor , Benedict Arnold ! '' 
Arnold , the Traitor was there also , heading his band of Assassins . 
He wished to save John Andre by taking Benedict Arnold prisoner . 
Once in New York , he enlisted in the Legion of Arnold . 
One object remained -- the capture of Arnold . 
That night Arnold went on ship-board , and with him the Deserter , who , taken to Virginia , left the British at the first opportunity , and after weeks of wandering and starvation , returned to his comrades . 
At last he approached the Colonel , and bending down , so that their faces nearly touched , uttered these words in a whisper : `` Give up Benedict Arnold for John Andre -- is that what you mean ? '' 
`` An officer from Washington waits in the room below , with authority from his General to make this proposition to you -- - Give me Arnold and I will give you Andre ! 
`` - Had George Washington offered me the Throne of the Western Continent , he could not have so tempted me , as he does by this proposition , to exchange Arnold for Andre ! 
For in that officer with the rich scarlet uniform , glittering with epaulettes of gold -- in that officer with the bold countenance , and forehead projecting over dark eyes that emitted a steady glare , he recognized -- - Benedict Arnold - . 
said Arnold , with a slight inclination of his head . 
`` Good evening , Colonel - Arnold ! 
It was not often that Arnold blushed , but now his throat , his cheeks , and brow were scarlet . 
For a moment he seemed stricken into stone , but at last he replied in a deep sonorous voice , that started Sir Henry Clinton from his chair : `` That leg sir , was twice broken ; the first time , - when I stormed Quebec - . 
Arnold sat down , and crossing his legs in a careless position , fixed his dark eyes full in Clinton 's face , as he spoke in a laughing tone : `` Do you know , General , I heard a very clever thing as I passed along the street . 
Two of - our - soldiers were conversing ; -- ` I tell you what it is , ' said one of the fellows to the other , ` Sir Henry Clinton could n't do a better thing , than send this Arnold -- -LRB- ha ! 
- this - Arnold , mark you ! -RRB- 
to General Washington , who will very likely hang him in place of Andre ! ' 
- Sir Henry saw the sneer on Arnold 's face , and knew at once that Andre 's fate was sealed ! 
Remember , that the wife of Benedict Arnold , on terms of intimate friendship with Andre , while the British held Philadelphia , corresponded with him long after her marriage , and then call to mind a single fact : her correspondence was the channel of communication between Arnold and the British General . 
Is it at all plausible , or probable , that she was ignorant of the contents of Arnold 's letters ? 
He was elevated to a Majority , dignified with the post of Adjutant General , in order that he might more effectually carry out the plan , originated between himself and Arnold . 
He was to enter West Point , not as an open foe , ready to combat with his enemies on the ramparts of the fortress , but as a Conspirator ; he was to conquer the stronghold , laid defenceless by the removal of the Continental force , by a juggle , and wreathe his brows with the parchments of a purchased victory . 
For this , his promised reward was the commission of a Brigadier General . 
With all his talent -- displayed as an Artist , a Poet , and a Soldier -- with all the genius which made him an admirable companion , with all the chivalry which won praise and tears from his enemies , with all the rich cluster of his gifts , and the dim memories that gather round his name , we must confess , that he was one of the originator 's of Arnold 's Treason , that he descended to a course of intrigue , beneath the honor of a warrior , that he was justly condemned and hung as a Spy . 
-- - John Andre and the Wife of Arnold , first planned the Treason , and then -- while his heart was lacerated by a sense of his wrongs -- lured him into the plot - . 
There is no point of Washington 's career more thoroughly worthy of our veneration , than his course in relation to Andre . 
Then the thought of Benedict Arnold , hurled from the Patriot and the Hero , into the Bandit and Traitor , as much by the persecutions of his enemies , as by his own faults , as much from the influence of Andre and his own wife , -LSB- 12 -RSB- as from inclination , has for me an interest that altogether surpasses the fate of the Spy . 
eaf251.n12 -LSB- 12 -RSB- It is stated on the authority of Aaron Burr , that the Wife of the Traitor , after she joined her husband in the British lines , expressed her contempt for the American cause , sanctioned the course of Arnold , and uttered other expressions of feeling , which showed that she was a co-partner in the work of Treason . 
We plant flowers over his grave , and yet he was a plotter from motives altogether mercenary -- We sing hymns about him , and yet with all his accomplishments , he was one of the main causes of Arnold 's ruin ; he it was who helped to drag the Patriot down into the Traitor . 
So , upon the homes of Virginia , in December , 1781 , burst the Traitor , Benedict Arnold . 
As his ship glided up James River , aided by wind and tide -- a leaden sky above , a dreary winter scene around , the other vessels following in the wake -- he stood on its deck , and drew his sword , repeating his oath , to avenge the death of John Andre ! 
-- It was only Arnold and his Men , laying an American home in ashes and blood . 
The first light of the winter 's day shone over the maddened visage of Arnold , cheering on his men to scenes of murder . 
The very men who fought under him , despised him . 
As the officers received his orders , they could not disguise the contempt of the curved lip and averted eye . 
Tortured by Remorse , hated , doubted , despised by the men who had purchased his sword , his honor , Arnold seemed at this time , to become the Foe of the whole human race . 
Arnold took the unanswered letter , sought the shadow of his tent , and did not speak for some hours . 
That calm derision cut him to the soul . 
There was brought before him , on a calm winter 's day , an American Captain who had been taken prisoner . 
Arnold surveyed the hardy soldier , clad in that glorious blue uniform , which he himself had worn with honor , and after a pause of silent thought , asked with a careless smile -- `` What will the Americans do with me , in case they take me prisoner ? '' 
Arnold 's countenance fell . 
`` Yes , you see Morgan and his men jined Arnold -- you 've heered of him ? '' 
`` Arnold -- yes , I think I have heard of that man ? '' 
Yes , stranger , I was with him , with Arnold on his v ` yge over land to Quebec ! 
`` You knew Arnold ? '' 
`` Wer n't I with him all the way , for two months ? 
Die n't I see him every hour of the day ? 
Arnold was always in the front ! '' 
`` He was a rash , high-tempered man ? '' 
Hot-tempered as old Sattin , but mind I tell ` ee , his heart was in the right place . 
Well , in midst of it all , Arnold calls me aside -- I see his face yet , with an eye like one of them fire-coals -- ses he , `` - Bingimin , you 're a little older than the rest of us ! 
`` Then you should a-seen him , at the Stormin ' o ' Quebec ! 
Why , even when his leg was broke , he cheered his men , and fought , sword in hand , until he fell in a puddle of his own blood ! 
I tell you , that Arnold was a born devil to fight ! '' 
`` I carried Arnold from the Rock at Quebec , and was with him when the Americans were retreating toward Lake Champlain . 
Can you tell me , what 's become of Benedict Arnold ? 
Is he alive ? '' 
`` He is , '' sullenly responded the traveller . 
`` So you knew Benedict Arnold ? '' 
Wait a minute , until I get my cap and rifle ; I 'll go with you to the edge of the swamp -- '' `` So you would like to know -- '' interrupted the deep voice of the Stranger -- `` So you would like to know what has become of Benedict Arnold ? '' 
It was not - Benedict Arnold - ! '' 
He died , believing still in the - Patriot Arnold - . 
Arnold was afterwards heard to say , that all the shames and scorns , which had been showered upon his head , never cut him so thoroughly to the soul , as the fervent admiration of that Soldier of the Wilderness , who in his lonely wanderings still cherished in his heart , the memory of the - Patriot Arnold - . 
It was in September 1781 , that Arnold descended like a Destroying Angel upon the homes of Connecticut . 
Tortured by a Remorse , that never for a moment took its vulture beak from his heart , fired by a hope to please the King who had bought him , he went with men and horses , swords and torches , to desolate the scenes of his childhood . 
This column marks the career of Arnold and his men , that the progress of his Brother in Murder . 
While Benedict Arnold stands in the steeple , surveying the work of assassins , yonder in Fort Griswold a brave young man , who finds all defence in vain , rushes toward the British officer and surrenders his sword . 
While he laid , cold and stiff , on the floor of the conquered fort , the flames from the burning town spread to the vessels in the river and to the light of blazing roofs and sails , Benedict Arnold looked his last upon his childhood 's home . 
Soon afterward he sailed from our shores , and came back no more . 
From this time , forth wherever he went , three whispered words followed him , singing through his ears into his heart -- - Arnold the Traitor - . 
When he stood beside his king in the House of Lords -- the weak old man , whispered in familiar tones to his gorgeously attired General -- a whisper crept through the thronged Senate , faces were turned , fingers extended , and as the whisper deepened into a murmur , one venerable Lord arose and stated that he loved his Sovereign , but could not speak to him , while by his side there stood -- - Arnold the Traitor - . 
He went to the theatre , parading his warrior form , amid the fairest flowers of British nobility and beauty , but no sooner was his visage seen , than the whole audience rose -- the Lord in his cushioned seat , the vagrant of London in the gallery -- they rose together , while from the pit to the dome echoed the cry -- `` - Arnold the Traitor - ? '' 
When he issued from his gorgeous mansion , the liveried servant , that ate his bread , and earned it too , by menial offices , whispered in contempt , to his fellow lacquey as he took his position behind his Master 's carriage -- - Benedict Arnold the Traitor - . 
and tell the man , that my threshhold can never be crossed by the murderer of my son -- by - Arnold the Traitor - . '' 
`` Time may spit upon me , but I never can pollute my sword by killing -- - Arnold the Traitor - ! '' 
The entire population of St. John 's -- accusing the owner of acting the part of incendiary , to his own property , in order to defraud the insurance companies -- assembled in that British town , in sight of his very widow , they hung an effigy , inscribed with these words -- `` - Arnold the Traitor - . '' 
He assisted him to escape , even aided him to secure his treasure in an empty cask , but as the prisoner , gliding down the side of the ship , pushed his raft toward the shore , that sentinel looked after him , and in broken English sneered -- `` - Arnold the Traitor - ! '' 
`` My name -- '' with a smile that had more of mockery than joy in its convulsive expression -- `` My name is - Benedict Arnold - . '' 
Tallyrand sank into a chair , gasping the words -- `` - Arnold the Traitor - . '' 
in his ears , and that the memory of his course of glory , gnawed like a canker at his heart , murmuring forever , ` true to your country , what might you have been , - O , Arnold the Traitor - ! ' 
I have dared to paint the agony of his death-hour , with a trembling hand and hushed breath , I have lifted the curtain from the death-bed of Benedict Arnold . 
So , after our dark and fearful journey over Arnold 's life , do we reach the last mountain top , and the day breaks over us . 
Not upon - him - , dawns the blessed light -- ah , no ! 
But upon us it glows , and we will now look back upon the long track of his deeds , the waste of his despair , spread far behind us . 
Yet ere we pass to those shades of Romance and Dreams , let us , at one bold sweep , survey the life of Arnold , his Glory , his Wrongs , his Crimes . 
At the age of sixteen , he ran away and joined the British army , was stationed at Ticonderoga , but unable to endure either the restraint of discipline , or the insults of power , he deserted and returned home . 
He married at New Haven , a lady named Mansfield , who bore him three sons , Benedict , Richard , and Henry . 
After the campaign of Canada was over , Arnold was accused of misconduct in seizing certain goods at Montreal . 
The testimony of the first historian in our country , proves , that in the removal of these goods , he was neither practising any secret manœuvre , nor did he endeavor to retain them in his possession . 
It is well to bear these truths in mind : the charge of misconduct at Montreal , has been suffered almost to grow into history . 
The nation rung with the fame of his deeds . 
On the water , as on the land , his indomitable genius bore down all opposition . 
A week before the battle of Trenton , he joined Washington 's Camp , on the west side of the Delaware , remained with the Chieftain three days , and then hastened to Providence , in order to meet the invaders on the New England coast . 
Washington was astonished and surprised at this measure ; he wrote a letter to Arnold , stating `` that the promotion which was due to your seniority , was not overlooked for want of merit in you . '' 
While on a journey from Providence to Philadelphia , where he intended to demand an investigation of his conduct , he accomplished the brilliant affair of Danbury . 
Congress heard of this exploit , and without delay , Arnold was promoted to the rank of Major General . 
With an inconsistency not easily explained , the date of his commission was still left below the other five major generals . 
We next behold him in Philadelphia , boldly demanding an investigation of his character , at the hands of Congress . 
The Board of War , to whom all charges were referred , after examining all the papers , and conversing with the illustrious Carrol , -LRB- Commissioner at Montreal -RRB- declared that the character and conduct of General Arnold had been groundlessly and cruelly aspersed . 
Congress confirmed that report , complimented Arnold with the gift of an elegantly caparisoned horse , yet still neglected to restore him to his hardwon rank . 
While his accounts lingered in the hands of Congress , Arnold was appointed to command the army then convening in the vicinity of Philadelphia . 
This duty he discharged with his usual vigor . 
At last , chafed by the refusal of Congress to settle his accounts , and adjust his rank , he resigned his commission in these words : `` - I am ready to risk my life for my Country , but honor is a sacrifice that no man ought to make - -- '' At this crisis came the news of the fall of Ticonderoga , and the approach of a formidable Army under Burgoyne . 
On the same day that Congress received the resignation , they also received a letter from Washington , recommending that Arnold should be immediately sent to join the northern army . 
Arnold did not hesitate a moment . 
He took up his sword once more , only hoping that his claims would be heard , after he had fought the battles of his country . 
In the two Battles of Saratoga , the one fought on September the 19th , and the action of Oct. 7th , Arnold was at once the General and the Hero . 
From 12 o'clock , until night on the 19th , the battle was fought entirely by Arnold 's division , with the exception of a single regiment from another brigade . 
`` I will soon put an end to it , '' exclaimed Arnold , and set off in full gallop for the field . 
Gates was so far forgetful of justice , as to avoid mentioning the name of Arnold or his division in his despatches . 
A quarrel ensued , and Arnold resigned his command . 
On the 7th of Oct. , without a command , he rushed to the field and led the Americans to victory . 
If ever a man won his way to rank , by heaping victory on victory , that man was Benedict Arnold . 
In May , 1778 , Arnold joined the army at Valley Forge . 
But a short time elapsed ere he established his headquarters in Philadelphia , as Military Governor or Commander . 
This marriage encircled Arnold with a throng of Tory associates . 
So familiar was the intimacy of his wife with John Andre , that she corresponded with him , after the British left the city and returned to New York . 
A list of charges against him , with letters and papers was presented to Congress , by General Joseph Reed , President of Pennsylvania , and referred to a committee of inquiry . 
That Committee vindicated Arnold from any criminality in the matters charged against him . 
On the 18th of March , 1779 , Arnold resigned his commission . 
Arnold then formed the project of forming a settlement for the soldiers and officers who had served under him . 
The members of Congress from that state seconded his wishes , and wrote a joint letter to Governor Clinton , soliciting his aid : -- `` - To you Sir , or to our state , General Arnold can require no recommendation : a series of distinguished services , entitle him to respect and favor - -- '' The President of Congress , the virtuous Jay , enforced the same application in a private letter to Governor Clinton . 
He said -- -- `` - Generosity to Arnold will be Justice to the State - . '' 
Was Arnold without noble and virtuous friends ? 
Andre affixed to his letter the signature , - John Anderson - , and Arnold was known as - Gustavus - . 
Andre from a mere correspondent and friend of the wife , was at last selected as the great co-partner in the work of Treason . 
On the 25th , Arnold escaped to the Vulture . 
In May 1781 , Arnold returned to New York from Virginia , thus narrowly escaping the capitulation of Yorktown ; in September he laid New London in ashes ; and in December he sailed from the Continent for England . 
-- Thus plainly in short sentences and abrupt paragraphs , without the least attempt at eloquence or display , you have the prominent points of Arnold 's career before you . 
So much light , so much darkness , so much glory , so much dishonor , so much meanness , so much magnanimity , so much iron-hearted despair , so much womanly tenderness in the form of Benedict Arnold ! 
In the lonely hours of night , when absorbed in the books which tell of him , or searching earnestly the memorials which are left on the track of time , to record his career , I have felt the tears come to my eyes , and the blood beat more tumultuously at my heart . 
You may not be able to appreciate my feelings when I survey the career of Arnold , but you will in any event , do justice to the honesty of my purpose . 
Arnold has not one friend , on the wide earth of God , unless indeed his true-hearted sister survives . 
But Arnold -- where is there a friend -- to pay for one tear shed over his dishonored grave ? 
Guided by the same feeling with which I investigated the character of Washington , and found it more Pure and Beautiful than even the dull history tells it , I have taken up Arnold and looked at him in every light , and to his good and evil , rendered -- - Justice - . 
Those who expect to find in my pages , a minute record of his petty faults -- how he burnt grasshoppers when a little boy , or swindled grown men out of fine black horses , when a warrior -- will be wofully disappointed . 
It is a colonel 's commission in the Continental army , addressed to -- - Benedict Arnold - ! 
Arnold was a hero , a man of genius , although a Traitor . 
The man who would taint with one unhallowed word the sanctity of THE - Union - , stands arrayed in the leprosy of Arnold 's Treason , without one redeeming ray of his heroism , one spark of his genius . 
We all know that there were other Traitors beside Arnold in the Revolution , who escaped disgrace and the gallows , made money by chaffering with both parties , and died in the odour of a suspicious sanctity , leaving a dubious fame to their children . 
Suppose I was to go forth on some dark night , to the grave of one of those Traitors , take up his corse , strip from it the mark of patriotism , and show it by the light of history , a base and dishonored thing , for all its thick coating of gold ? 
There are other traitors than Benedict Arnold ! '' 
Your presence may remind congress of your past services to this country ; and if it is in my power to impress them , command my best exertions with freedom , as they will be rendered cheerfully by one , who entertains a lively sense of the importance of your works , and who , with much pleasure subscribes himself , If it were possible at this late day , to recover the skeletons of Judas Iscariot and Benedict Arnold , much as I despise these melancholy examples of human frailty , I would not insult even their bones , by placing the `` carcass '' of this Reviewer in their company . 
There you behold a letter directed to General the Marquis de La Fayette ; another bears the name of General Anthony Wayne ; a third General Benedict Arnold ; and that large pacquet , with the massive seal , is inscribed with the words -- To His Excellency , John Hancock , President of the Continental Congress . 
He had been with Arnold at Quebec , with Washington at Brandywine , this hardy Sergeant Caleb -- but to go to the Tory rendezvous in disguise , was to act the part of a - Spy - , and the robber-captain of the Tories would put him to death , on the first rope and nearest tree , as a -- - Spy - !
