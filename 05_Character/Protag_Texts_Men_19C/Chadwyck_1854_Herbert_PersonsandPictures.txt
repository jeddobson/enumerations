And she had with her in Hennebon the Bishop of Léon , the uncle of that traitor Sir Hervè de Léon , Sir Yves de Tresiquidi , the Lord of Landreman , Sir William de Cadoudal , the Governor of Guincamp , the two brothers of Quirich , Sir Oliver , and Sir Henry de Spinefort , and many others . 
The other lords -- such as the Count de la Marche , Sir James of Bourbon , Sir Charles d'Albret , Sir Philip d'Artois , Sir Henry and Sir Philip de Bar , Sir Peter de Navarre -- rode in different paths . 
About fourteen years before , the tremendous battle of Agincourt , won by the fifth Henry of England , had more than decimated the aristocracy , and completely subdued the feudal military power of France ; all the leading princes of the blood royal , and a fearful proportion of the nobility of the realm , had been slain on the fatal field , or still languished in English dungeons . 
And shortly afterward , though the battle of Baugé , wherein the Duke of Clarence fell by the spear of the Scottish champion , Allan Swinton , and Dorset , Somerset , and Huntingdon were made prisoners , threw a solitary gleam of lustre over the dark affairs of France , it availed not to retard the progress of Henry , who had , in fact , conquered all the northern provinces , and held , them in quiet possession ; who was master of the capital , Paris , wherein his son , afterwards Henry VI. , of most hapless memory , was born amid general acclamations , and almost unanimously hailed as heir to both crowns ; and who had chased the Dauphin beyond the Loire , whither he was pursued , almost in despair , by the victorious and united arms of Burgundy and England . 
Had Henry 's life been prolonged , it is difficult to conjecture what would have been the end , for he was no less politic as a prince , and shrewd as a man , than daring , skilful , and successful as a leader . 
Soon after the death of Henry , his rival , Charles VI. , died also . 
He had for many years possessed mere nominal authority in France , and his life had been as unhappy to himself as disastrous to his country . 
To his son he left only a disputed crown and a divided country , and that he ever owned the one unquestioned and the other entire , he owned in part to his own high qualities , and in part to the character and achievements of Joan , the maid of Are and Orleans . 
He was crowned at Poictiers Charles VI. ; his Paris , and Rheims -- the sacred coronation city -- being both in the hands of the English . 
This event occurred in the year 1422 , and , although Henry was an infant , and when even he arrived at manhood little better than imbecile , so splendid was the administration of the protector , the Duke of Bedford , and so great the talents of the renowned generals who commanded under him , Somerset , Warwick , Arundel , Salisbury , Suffolk , and the still greater Talbot , that they not only held Guienne , the capital , and all the northern provinces , but pressed the war with vigor in the south and west , so that the position of Charles VI . 
Henry the Fourth , usurping Bolingbroke , had departed , murmuring with his last sigh , as he saw in the clearsightedness of coming death , his son untimely grasping at the royal circlet , which he , himself , had grasped untimely , and now first felt to be no blessing but a burden -- Henry the Fifth , the merry mad Prince Hal , the Victor of Agincourt , had departed , and even in departing had discovered that The Earl of Bedford , the wise regent , had succeeded to the sway of England , and so much of France as yet remained submissive to the English sword and sceptre . 
In his great historical plays , by which he led captive the fancies of the great of his own day , and has led astray the judgments even of wise men ever since , Richard the Second , the parts of Henry the Fourth , Henry the Fifth , the parts of Henry the Sixth , and Richard the Third , lie almost all the opinions of almost all readers of the present day concerning the rights and wrongs , the virtues and vices , the sins and sorrows of the personages of that distracted period . 
I do not intend to charge the great poet with intentionally originating this falsehood ; for it is more than probable that historians and chroniclers -- such as they were at that day -- began , so soon as Henry VII . 
Richard II. , who succeeded to the throne of England in 1377 , was the only son and heir of Edward the Black Prince , the eldest son of Edward III. ; he survived his father , and ascended the throne at the decease of his grandfather , being then only eleven years of age ; and though in his early youth , while yet a minor , he displayed both energy and courage ; as he advanced in years , he proved himself the weakest , most imbecile , and favoriteled of English princes , with scarcely the exceptions of his hapless great-grandfather , Edward II. , and yet more hapless successor , the sixth Henry , with whose reign we have to do . 
This usurping Henry IV. , as I have said , held his crown so long as he lived , and transmitted his title , disputed during his life , to be yet more fiercely disputed after his death , to his son , Henry V. , one of the brightest supporters of the English crown , dying a natural death in 1413 , as unpopular at his demise as he had been popular at his accession . 
In that year Henry V. succeeded , and though disputes were raised in behalf of the Earl of March , by an admixture of mercy tempering the severity of law , he suppressed all conspiracies , spread the glories of English arms far beyond the seas , and died the last great foreign conqueror , and perhaps the most popular of English kings , in 1422 . 
To him succeeded , at the age of nine months , his only son , by Catherine of France , under the title of Henry VI. , and , with his crown , inherited the false and disputed title , without the strong heart or the strong hand which can out of might make right . 
During his long minority , and the protectorate of the able and upright Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester , his uncles , no claims were laid to his crown . 
Yet even his minority was unfortunate ; for the loss of all the French provinces , one by one -- nearly all of which , including the capital , were held by the English at his accession heated the mind of the public against him , and tended in some degree to his subsequent disasters . 
A short time before he attained to his majority , the great and good Duke of Bedford died at Rouen ; and the unfortunate dissensions which existed between the Cardinal Winchester and the Duke of Gloucester excluded that honorable prince from the councils of the young king , who , as he arrived at years of manhood , showed an imbecility of character , a want of parts , a silly , weak good-nature , and a willingness to be guided , not inferior to that which had discrowned Richard II. , and set his own house on the throne , though his character was not disgraced by the love of low society and vulgar debauchery , which belonged to that most unprincely of princes . 
Shortly after Henry 's accession , his ministers -- or governors , as they might be called more justly -- the Dukes of Somerset , Suffolk , and Buckingham , negotiated his marriage with Margaret of Anjou , the daughter of René , King of Provence , and titular king of Sicily , Naples , and Jerusalem , and Count of Anjou , of all which splendid titles he possessed the barren honor only , with scarce the land or revenue of an English baron . 
By the words her favorite , the historian basely insinuates what he dare not assert , and he can show no possible suspicion of such a ground for calumny , that Margaret was an untrue wife of Henry ; an accusation , it needs not to say , which every action , every hour of her life -- full of devotion to himself while living , to his memory when dead -- brand with the living lie . 
It is also curious that when the Commons abandoned their false charges of treason , and accused Suffolk of misdemeanors only , the king himself , before the peers and commons , pronounced sentence of banishment against Suffolk , a sentence which Margaret could incontestablyhave prevented , had she chosen , and must have chosen to prevent had she loved him , for whatever she could do with the wily Beaufort , the able Somerset , and the shrewd Suffolk , she certainly could wind the weak Henry to her will , though she did so only , so far as history shows , for his own good . 
Suffolk was banished , however , without the queen 's moving in his favor ; and as he went to France for refuge , `` a captain of a vessel was there employed to intercept him in his passage ; he was seized near Dover , his head struck off on the side of a long boat , and his body thrown into the sea . 
It is certain that the true hereditary right to the crown of England was not in Henry VI. , and that it was in Richard , Duke of York . 
Still Henry was not himself an usurper ; he had inherited his crown , after two continuous , prosperous , and uninterrupted reigns , from his grandfather , to whose accession the parliament of England had assented . 
It is true , again , that not only Richard of York , the true heir to the throne , but that Henry was as incapable , weak , and as unfit to govern as the unhappy Richard , whom his own ancestor , Harry of Bolingbroke , had dethroned and succeeded ; and that , of consequence , the same right of revolution -- if one may coin such a right -- which justified Harry of Bolingbroke in discrowning , and the Parliament in superseding the imbecile Richard II. , would justify Richard of York in dethroning , and the Parliament in deposing the no less imbecile Henry VI . 
Henry , Duke of Lancaster , who deposed and succeeded Richard , under the title of Henry IV. , was descended directly from the Duke of Lancaster , third sonof Edward III. , and therefore could of course lay no claim , founded on birthright , to the throne , so long as any heirs of the second sonof Edward should be in existence , which it has been shown there were in the persons of Richard of York and his family of sons , which was numerous . 
In reply to this it was stated that Richard II. , son of the Black Prince , of the eldest house , had been dethroned by an unanimous vote of the Parliament , on account of his total incapacity to govern ; and that the vacant throne had been conferred by the same power , in whom it was competent to confer it , on Henry of Lancaster , surnamed Bolingbroke , of the third son ; which house , though confessedly secondof the family , were by that act of Parliament , and by quiet possession of the throne during two reigns , and the peaceful transmission of it to a third prince , in direct succession , thus rendered first of the realm ; and if not right heirs , at least right owners of the throne . 
All jurists hold that the adherents of a king de facto , such as was Henry VI. , Charles II. , and the First and Second Georges of England , can not be held liable to charges of treason for the maintenance of existing royalties ; and , though the bloody character of the age and the fierce partisan spirit , which succeeded to the extinction of chivalry , and not yet mitigated by the regular systematic principles of modern warfare , led to the perpetration of savage slaughters and sanguinary reprisals during the reign of the unhappy Henry , the officers of the Long Parliament never pretended to punish the cavaliers of Charles I. for treason , until after the deposition and decapitation of Charles , when the Republic and the Protectorate had in their turn become the governments de facto . 
and Henry V. , but had continually adhered to the title of kings of England , and ever kept up the semblance of a court at St. Germains , under the protection of Louis XIV . 
It is not the least strange thing concerning this strange succession of struggles , during which men of the highest birth and eminence changed their opinions as they did their coats -- almost daily , with as little reason asked , or reproach incurred -- that in the final conflict the Lancastrian claimant , Henry of Richmond , Duke of Brittany , was a double usurper , possessing no title de jure , and none of course de facto , to the seat from which he ejected Richard III. , the last heir male of the house of York -- though , thanks to Shakspeare , he has come down to us as the gallant asserter of good rights , and righteous avenger of foul wrongs done to the lawful line of English majesty . 
He found , however , to his great surprise the gates shut against him , and on his retreat into Kent was pursued by Henry with very superior force , and compelled to go into retirement ; his own popularity , no less than the weakness of the court , and it may be , the imbecile good nature of the king , rendered it unwise or impossible to attaint or punish him . 
At about the same time a son , Edward , was born to Henry by Margaret , the Frenchwoman , who was already accused by the people in general of the treacherous surrender of the English conquests . 
Within a brief space Henry , always incapable and imbecile , fell into such a fit of melancholy moodiness that he became unable even to go through the pageantry , and support the semblance of royalty . 
It was but a short time before , emboldened by the partial recovery of Henry , and by the timidity or conscientiousness of the Duke of York , the Queen 's party recovered the ascendency , released Somerset from the tower , and annulled the authority of the Duke . 
But the duke again hesitated , and was contented with the restoration of his protectorates , and indemnity to all the Yorkists , and the revocation of all the grants which had been made by the crown since the death of Henry V. Margaret , however , perceiving doubtless that the termination of these measures must inevitably be the ultimate exclusion of her son from the throne , should the House of York hold the authority , influence , and resources of the crown , during the life of Henry -- whether the latter nominally held the throne or no -- resolved on a bold and instant stroke for supremacy , and early in the following year produced the king , again somewhat improved in health , before the houses , and caused him once more to resume the government , which the Duke of York did not oppose , and all things once again seemed settled on a sure and amicable foundation , terms being assented to by both parties , and an outward reconciliation patched up for the time , which , however , no one endowed even with common understanding could expect to endure beyond the moment . 
In this instance , however , the respect shown to him was limited to his person , not extended to his power ; for Richard of York , though he sought not even now violently or perforce to dethrone him , laid claim to the regal title and authority before the house of Peers , who debated the question tranquilly and gravely for several successive days , and at length decided that the title of the house of York was good , but that in virtue of Henry 's peaceful succession to the throne and quiet tenure of it during thirty-eight years , he should be allowed to retain the title and dignity of king during his life , the present administration and future inheritance of the crown being in Richard and his heirs . 
Less fortunate , Henry was taken , and though treated with some show of courtesy , was immured in the tower . 
Edward , however , with energy equal to the emergency , himself obtained succor in Burgundy and Zealand , landed in Yorkshire , outmanœuvred Warwick who had advanced to meet him at Leicester , entered London , and again became master of Henry 's person and his briefly born authority . 
Inno character , perhaps , within the whole range of human history , are the fatal and destructive influences of unlimited power , a subservient ministry , and the opportunity of unbridled gratification , on a mind naturally selfish and addicted to pleasure , more clearly demonstrated than in that of the eighth Henry of England . 
When he ascended the throne of England , on the decease of his father , Henry VII. , the conqueror of Bosworth field -- one of the coldest , cruellest , and most avaricious princes who ever sate on a throne -- his accession was greeted with universal joy and gratulation by all ranks and classes of society . 
Young , and of singularly vigorous and handsome frame , with a fine countenance and fresh complexion , a lively and spirited air , a perfect skill in every manly and athletic exercise , a very considerable proficiency in literature and the arts , Henry , at this time in his eighteenth year , was as unlike as possible to the bloated , unwieldy , peevish , and furious tyrant -- with a face and a roar liker to those of an old lion than to the features and voice of a man -- as we find him in later days , and as he is better known to most readers , than as the gay and gallant prince , the beloved of his people , and the admired and courted of all Europe . 
The cause of this may , perhaps , in some degree be traced to the fact that in the reign of Henry , as likewise in that of his manly hearted daughter , Elizabeth , who is , like her father , to this day a historic favorite , the executions on the scaffold and at the stake , and the oppressions and exactions of all kinds fell mainly on the upper orders -- that it was noble , princely , and royal blood , which flowed like water through the latter portion of his reign ; and that the humble and the lowly born were treated , even when guilty of open rebellion , with unusual leniency and tenderness . 
Arthur having died within a few months of the wedding without issue , Henry the VIIth , desirous of maintaining his alliance with Spain , and unwilling to restore the Infanta 's dowry of 200,000 ducats , compelled Henry , whom he created Prince of Wales on the occasion , to be contracted to the Infanta . 
Henry , who was but twelve years of age , while the princess was nineteen , made all the resistance of which such a boy is capable ; but the king persisting , and a dispensation being obtained from the Pope , the espousals were contracted between the parties in the year of our Lord 1502 . 
That they succeeded was probably from the weight of the political , rather than the personal considerations ; for although Catharine was of fine person , engaging manner , and rare excellence of character , both as a woman and a queen , it is difficult to believe that passion or predilection could have influenced a youth of Henry 's sensual and sanguine temperament towards one so much his senior , and otherwise so seriously disqualified for his bed . 
Still , however , it must be admitted that Henry lived with her , so far as can be ascertained , with perfect tenderness and satisfaction for many years ; that he appointed her queen-regent of England during his absence in France at the head of his army ; that he carried her with him into that kingdom , when he subsequently visited it in peace , to hold with his superb and splendid rival , Francis the First , that famous conference known as the Field of the Cloth of Gold ; that he created her only daughter Mary , Princess of Wales ; and that it was not until nearly eighteen years after their union , when he was hopeless of having any male heir by Catharine , when he began to be alarmed by doubts of his daughter 's legitimacy , and fears of the Scottish succession after his own demise -- when last he was , as he asserted , tormented by religious scruples on that head , that he resolved to abrogate the marriage with the Infanta . 
Even after he had resolved on this step , to which he was urged by the advice of his confessor , the Bishop of Lincoln , by the unanimous opinion of all the English prelates with the one exception of Fisher , Bishop of Rochester , by the counsel of Wolsey , and his own doctrinal studies of Thomas Aquinas -- and which was perhaps really expedient as a political measure for securing the succession of the English throne -- he still visited her constantly , conducted himself towards her with all tenderness and respect , and never hinted the slightest dissatisfaction with her conduct and demeanor . 
On the whole , I am disposed to regard the conduct of Henry in regard to Catharine of Arragon with less decided reprobation than almost any other action of his life ; I think it justifiable to believe , judging from Henry 's known addiction to polemical and theological studies , and his generally superstitious -- for in a man so cruel and immoral , they can not be termed religious -- tendencies , that he was for once seriously sincere in his scruples ; and , moreover , though it were a late period at which to discern the validity of such scruples , and a cold and hard measure to repudiate a blameless wife after eighteen years of undisturbed connexion , and to illegitimatize her innocent offspring , those scruples were certainly valid , and the great probability is that the marriage would have been declared invalid , the princess Mary illegitimate , and that a civil war would have ensued , after the death of Henry , at the cost of much blood and treasure to England . 
How far he was sincerely actuated by these views , it is now of course impossible to decide ; but it appears to be susceptible of clear proof , that he had mooted the question of divorce with Catharine of Arragon , before he had ever seen Anne Boleyn , to his sudden passion for whom his conduct at this crisis is often ascribed , and though that passion doubtless inflamed his scruples , and spurred him to more vehement action , it is certainly not fair to ascribe to it the origin of his intentions . 
The truth seems to be , that he married Catharine in the first instance , from what were supposed to be at the time sufficient and satisfactory political reasons , but were afterwards discovered to be the very reverse ; that he had never any feelings towards her stronger than calm and moderate regard ; that the discovery of the probable ill consequences of the marriage , combined with the decay of her beauty , the increase of her years , and certain diseases to which she was liable , awoke his scruples , and perhaps excited some aversion to her person ; and that to these was added the last grain needed to turn the balance against the queen , the violent and sudden passion created on first sight of the beautiful Anne Boleyn . 
The marriage of Henry with the queen had been consummated , only in consequence of dispensation from the Pope ; and , in order to abrogate it , on the ground that it was incestuous and therefore null and void , a papal bull was necessary ; and to this end , Clement , the ruling pontiff , was piled with seduetions and cajoleries by Henry through his minister , the famous Wolsey , while Charles the First , King of Spain and Emperor of Germany , menaced him no less violently , in order to prevent a divorce against his aunt , on grounds so disgraceful . 
For a time , Clement appears to have wavered , and been in truth inclined to the cause of Henry , and accordingly Cardinal Campeggio was sent legate to England , and a commission was issued to him and Wolsey , in order to examine into the question in all its particulars . 
They accordingly commenced their proceedings , by citing the king and queen , both of whom presented themselves in court , the former answering to his name ; Catharine , however , instead of answering , cast herself at the feet of the king , and uttered a harangue of the most pathetic and affecting , and at the same time of the most dignified and impressive character , which should have moved to the strongest sympathy and even doubt , if not to conviction , any hearts less obdurate than those of Henry and the cardinals ; after this , denying the jurisdiction of the court , with a low reverence to the king , she departed from the hall , and never would return to it . 
She was declared , therefore , contumacious , and the legate proceeded to try the case ; Henry declaring on her withdrawal , that he had never found cause to doubt her probity and honor , but that , on the contrary , she had ever been a dutiful , affectionate , and virtuous wife ; and that his only scruples were those concerning the legality of his espousals ; from the charge of encouraging these scruples , he , moreover , acquitted Cardinal Wolsey . 
For some time , all things appeared to progress in the manner most consonant to the King 's wishes ; but at the moment when Henry was confidently looking for a sentence in his favor , Campeggio prorogued the court on pretences wholly frivolous , until the first of October , and returned to Rome , when it was understood that he had burned the decretal bull which had been intrusted to him . 
For above three years , the struggles of Henry to obtain a divorce had now endured , and with their close he regarded Wolsey in the most unfavorable light , though it was probable that the cardinal had in truth served him to the best of his ability . 
Anne , too , was hostile to him from a conviction that he would oppose her marriage , and his ruin was decreed , and no sooner decreed than consummated . 
He was dismissed from all his offices . 
York Place , afterwards the royal palace at Whitehall , his town residence , was confiscated to the royal use , and all his rich furniture , plate , and personal property . 
Up to this period , Henry had treated Catharine with all distinction and even regard , visiting her frequently and endeavoring to persuade her to cease her opposition to his divorce ; now , however , finding her inflexible , he ceased to visit her , and allowed her to choose any of his palaces which she would for her abode . 
A subsequent sentence ratified Henry 's marriage with Anne Boleyn ; and that princess being shortly after brought to bed of a daughter , Elizabeth , that mighty and man-hearted woman , who afterwards swayed the sceptre with such puissance and renown , Mary , Princess of Wales , was declared illegitimate , as the issue of an unlawful marriage , and the daughter of Anne created Princess of Wales in her stead . 
From this period , for some time , Anne Boleyn 's felicity was the theme of every tongue ; her ascendency over the king , whose passion for her , it seems , increased rather than flagged on possession , grew daily ; and so anxious was Henry to efface every trace of his former marriage , that he announced to the unhappy Catharine that she was to be styled , thenceforth , only the Princess Dowager of Wales , and endeavored by compulsory measures , and menaces against her servants , to make her acquiesce in that determination . 
For once , however , his iron will was vanquished , for so long as she lived she admitted no one to her presence , but with the wonted ceremonial ; nor could any threats deter her servants from waiting on her according to her title and pretensions . 
Henry , it is said , was moved to tears , on reading this last evidence of Catharine 's unmerited affection ; but it is also stated , though the narrator , Burnet , is a historian of more prejudice and passion than veracity , that Queen Anne rejoiced inhumanly and indecently at the demise of her rival . 
From the moment of Henry 's union with Anne Boleyn , the date of which we have outstripped a little , in the desire of completing the sad tale of the fate of Catharine uninterrupted , his whole character was strangely altered for the worse ; and from a rash , impulsive , passionate , and headstrong prince , violent in his will , impatient of opposition , and selfish in the extreme , he now became a barbarous , bloodthirsty tyrant ; second , if second , only to Tiberius and Nero , whose cruelties upon the Christians he imitated almost to the letter -- upon romanists and protestants alike , whosoever the first opposed his will . 
From that moment , Henry seems not only to have ceased to love , but actually to have hated , Anne Boleyn ; for , in this odious and inhuman voluptuary , there were two singular characteristics -- first , that licentious as he was , furious in his passion , and unrestrained in his will by any considerations human or divine , he appears rarely or never to have had recourse to gallantry or intrigue , or to have contemplated the possibility of gratifying his passions except by marriage -- and second , that his passion , so soon as it was satiated , was converted into a furious hatred , which could be satisfied only by the blood of the once loved object . 
Those only of his victim wives whom he had never loved , he never hated ; and therefore suffered to live on in sorrowful , dishonored widowhood . 
In his new passion for Jane Seymour , he was now set on the death of Anne ; and with him a resolution , once adopted , tarried not long time short of its fulfilment . 
Her own uncle , Norfolk , preferring the ties of religious partisanship to those of blood , became her most embittered enemy ; and Cranmer alone , vainly for her , and in the end fatally for himself , strove to divert Henry from his brutal purpose . 
But innocence itself was powerless ; and , Henry being determined not only to destroy this lovely and virtuous being , who had slept so softly in his bosom , but also to illegitimatize her issue , she was induced , by terrors of the extreme sentence of the stake , to admit that , in consequence of her prior attachment to the Lord Piercy , a lawful impediment existed to her marriage with the king ; whereupon , most reluctantly , the primate who presided , was compelled to declare the marriage null , and Elizabeth illegitimate -- a compliance with the tyrant 's will , which availed not in after days to save his own body from the flames of persecution . 
On the morrow of her execution , Henry espoused Jane Seymour , unable in the rage of his passion to give so much of delay as even decency required , to the memory of one whom his cruel and remorseless heart had once doubtless loved as well as it was capable of loving anything . 
Hoping , on the death of Anne Boleyn , to regain perhaps her legitimacy , the Lady Mary now sought to be reconciled with Henry ; and , at length , after renouncing the hope , and owning her own mother 's marriage unlawful , she was in some sort received into favor ; but not for that would the old , inconsistent tyrant reject Elizabeth , who was so fortunate as to find grace with the new queen -- a lady of sweet disposition and excellent virtue -- who sorrowed for the fate of the rival she had unwillingly supplanted , and treated her orphan child with tenderness almost maternal . 
But she died -- as the ancients were wont to say `` whom the gods love , die '' -- young ; nor survived Henry 's short-lived love , to endure his indifference or incur the doom which ever followed his hatred . 
Within a year of her marriage , and two days after the birth of her son Edward -- created , when not yet six days old , Prince of Wales , Duke of Cornwall , and Earl of Chester -- Jane Seymour passed into a better world ; the best perhaps , the most beautiful , and certainly the happiest , not least so in the hour of her death , of Henry 's queens . 
Yet though he loved her , his joy for the birth of an heir wiped away his grief for the death of a wife , almost before a tear was shed ; and it does not appear that her memory dwelt so much as an hour in his cruel and callous heart . 
As hitherto the king 's marriages had been dictated by passion and the preference for beauty , which he called affection , his next was to be founded on political motives ; and , after deliberating long between the niece of the emperor , and the relatives of Francis , he at length decided on marrying Ann of Cleves , whose picture he had seen and admired , and by whose hand he hoped to secure the support of the German princes , in case of war arising with the catholic powers , who threatened hostilities in consequence of his secession from the Pope . 
The former resulted in the speedy execution of the minister ; the latter in the no less speedy abrogation of Anne 's marriage , on the plea of her previous contract with the Duke of Lorraine , added to Henry 's assertion that he had not given his inward consentto the union . 
This marriage of Henry 's -- great as had been his gratification in the early period of his intimacy with the youthful , beautiful , and artful Kate , and vast as had been her influence upon his mind , almost even tending towards a counter-revolution in religious matters -- was to produce to him , almost ere its first year was ended , some of those evils and exactions which his alliance had invariably worked on others . 
Yet not even this affront could restrain Henry 's amorous propensities ; and , in the year 1542 , within two years -LRB- long space for him to tarry -RRB- after that infamous discovery , he married Catharine Parr , widow of the Earl of Neville , a woman no longer in the flower of youth , nor beauteous ; but virtuous , and winning in her ways , and gifted with a shrewd tact to divine and anticipate the humors , and thence to anticipate the wishes , and avoid the anger of her tyrant . 
Once , when beautiful , brave Anne Ascue suffered herself to be dislocated on the rack , so that she could not stand at the stake , but was burned sitting in a chair , rather than implicate her queen in opinions which both held in common , touching the real presence ; and again when , betrayed by the ardor and excitement of conversation , she contended too eagerly in argument in behalf of the reformed doctrines , against Henry himself , who , it must be remembered , was no reformer , nor protestant , but as strong a catholic as any ; save that he wished himself to be both pope and king , and to concentrate under one office and one title the emoluments and powers of the two dignities . 
The cleverness and womanly tact with which she extricated herself from that dilemma , by flattering Henry 's love of power and pride of argument , and by playing upon his foibles , must give us a high opinion of her talent and self-conduct , whatever it may do of her sincerity . 
owing to some personal qualities , such as daring bravery , profuse expenditure , a sort of wild and capricious generosity , and his rough and ready accessibility to all his subjects , he had preserved to the last the regard and even the admiration of his subjects ; and is even now regarded traditionally by the lower orders of England , as a sort of roi bonhomme , under the sobriquet of Bluff King Hal -- much as in the neighboring kingdom of France , the Fourth Henry of that realm has been with much more justice esteemed by his people . 
There has been much error in the estimate usually formed of the religious feelings or principles -- for opinions or convictions I can not bring myself to call them -- of the eighth Henry , and of the extent and nature of the reformation which he set on foot in England . 
In the end , it is true that the changes which he set on foot did lead to the almost total extinction in England proper of the catholic faith , and to the establishment of what Henry would himself have called the Lutheran heresy . 
But nothing is more certain than that no end was farther than that from his desire or his contemplation . 
Infuriated in the first instance by the steady and persevering opposition of Clement , who then occupied the papal chair , to his divorce from Catharine of Arragon , and contemplated marriage with the beautiful Anne Boleyn ; and encouraged in his rebellious sentiments , by the unwillingness which had ever existed in the church as well as the laity in England -- fostered , probably , in some degree , by its insular position -- to submit implicitly to the absolute authority of a foreign head , Henry had absolutely rejected all obedience and allegiance , on his own part and on that of his subjects , to the head of the church at Rome , and had not only declared himself to be , but had obtained the acknowledgment of the church of England , that he indeed was the supreme and sole head of that church . 
Henry , in fact , did not for an instant desire the abolition of Catholicism , for he was probably as sincere in his own profession of that faith , as a man of his fieree , impulsive , uncontrollable , and sensual nature could be sincere in any religion . 
Nor did he desire to destroy papacy itself -- so far from it , that he desired ardently and strove earnestly to perpetuate it , in a divided form , making himself the Pope of England . 
This reason would have been enough in itself to have steeled the heart and armed the hand of Henry against all the true and thorough-going reformers ; as it was unquestionably in other days the cause of his great and manly-minded daughter 's unrelenting persecution of the puritans and dissenters , whom she in truth punished as assailants of the prerogatives of her crown , not as schismatics beyond the pale of her church . 
How far this may have weighed with Henry and prompted him to the cruel rigor with which he repressed the advance of protestant reform , is not so directly apparent as it is in the case of his daughter Elizabeth ; but as Henry in no respect lacked political shrewdness or foresight , though he at times suffered his violent passions to prevail against the maxims of sound statesmanship , and as no king ever lived who was more jealous of his authority , there is no reason to doubt that he clearly foresaw the parallel and contemporaneous spread of liberal feelings in matters of church and state , of religious and political reform . 
So far , therefore , was Henry from being a religious reformer , or a favorer of protestantism , that the condition of the Lollard , the protestant reformer , or the heretical disbeliever in any of the peculiar doctrines of the Romish church , was infinitely more perilous than that of the most violent and steadfast catholic who held out to extremity for the supremacy of the Pope . 
Henry indeed was scarcely second in his persecution of hereties , and his predilection for autos-da-fè , to the barbarous and bigoted Philip of Spain , though his butcherings and burnings were on a more limited and less general scale . 
Henry consulted Gardiner and Wriothesly , and both of them encouraging , nay , urging him to extreme measures , he ordered articles of impeachment to be drawn against her . 
Henry , however , was furious that a woman 's weakness should dare to dispute on points of reason with his manly understanding , and resolved that no indulgence should be shown to her ; and Henry 's ministers , hopeful that if put to the rack she would accuse other great ladies , and perhaps the queen herself , whose friend and confidante she was known to be , determined that whatever was to be the end , she should not escape the horrors of the question . 
Still , as she refused her assent to Henry 's polemical explanations and interpositions of authority , she was sentenced , as she had expected , to be burned alive at the stake as an heretic . 
That title he obtained , together with all the great estates of the Percy family in the north , which was still the most warlike part of England , by grant from the young king ; as the late Earl of Northumberland having died without issue , and his brother , Sir Thomas Percy , having been attainted for his share in the Yorkshire insurrection during the reign of Henry , the title was now extinct , and the lands were vested in the crown . 
This done he proceeded , being a man of extraordinary capacity and ability , both for peace and war , and of ambition not inferior to his parts , on his course of aggrandizement , by persuading the new Duke and Duchess of Suffolk to give their daughter , the Lady Jane Grey , who was the next of kin , and heiress to the Marchioness of Dorset , in marriage to his fourth son , the Lord Dudley Guilford . 
No sooner was James dead than , precisely as he expected , Henry determined on annexing Scotland to the English crown as an appanage , by means of a marriage between his young son Edward and the infant princess ; and , at first , fortune seemed completely to favor his plans . 
By means of the Scottish nobles , many of whom , and of high rank , had fallen into his hands at the disastrous rout of Solway , he succeeded in negotiating this marriage . 
Six hostages were to be delivered to Henry for the faithful performance of this contract , and it was stipulated that Scotland , notwithstanding its union with England , should retain all its own laws and privileges . 
Naturally , therefore , the pope and the whole of catholic Europe , fearful of the spread of Henry 's recent heresy , were willing to go every length to preserve Scotland to the discipline of the true church . 
Beaton escaped from custody -- the ecclesiastics lent him all their power ; the hereditary jealousy of England was revived among the martial Scottish nobles ; the hostages were denied , although the captive nobles had been suffered to go free on their parole of honor , which they all broke , with one honorable exception , Kennedy , Earl of Cassilis , who , true to his word , returned and surrendered himself to Henry -- an honorable action , honorably rewarded by that monarch , who at once set him free without condition . 
Enraged beyond all bonds of moderation by this duplicity , Henry threw himself into the arms of the emperor , declared war at once on Francis and on Scotland , and waged it unremittingly , but with varied success , during the remainder of his life . 
After Henry 's decease , and the accession of Edward , the Protector Somerset prosecuted the Scottish war with such ability and success that , after the victory of Pinkie Cleugh , one of the most disastrous to the Scottish ever fought on the soil of Scotland , it was perceived at once , by the queen dowager and the French party , that the only safety for their cause lay in transporting the young queen to France . 
And her it must be remembered that , in one of his wicked freaks , Henry had caused Elizabeth to be declared , by act of parliament , illegitimate -- and in his unaccountable caprice , though he afterwards caused the succession to be entailed on her after Edward and Mary , he never would permit the repeal of the act of illegitimacy . 
Henry II . 
She gave permission , therefore , to Henry Champernon to raise a regiment of gentlemen volunteers , and to transport them into France . 
It seems that , about this time , in connexion with Nicholas Blount and others , who afterwards attained to both rank and eminence , Raleigh attached himself to the Earl of Essex , who at that time disputed with Leicester the favors , if not the affection , of Elizabeth ; and , while in his suite , had the fortune to attract the notice of that princess by the handsomeness of his figure , and the gallantry of his attire ; she , like her father Henry , being quick to observe and apt to admire those who were eminently gifted with the thews and sinews of a man . 
I write England advisedly ; for , although she was a Frenchwoman by birth , and that of the very highest rank short of royalty , being a daughter of the princely house of La Tremouille -- it was still in England that all her great exploits were performed -- all her extraordinary qualities displayed ; and as she was married in very early youth to the gallant and noble Derby , nearly , indeed , at the same period when his royal master , Charles I. , espoused the beautiful daughter of the last hero-king of France , Henry , the Bearnois of Navarre , it is not unnatural to conclude that it was in her adopted , rather than her native country , that she learned those lessons of strong persistency , cool endurance , and patient fortitude , which would appear in all ages to have been characteristic rather of the English than of the French temper , which is generally held to be conspicuous for impulsive gallantry and offensive valor , rather than for perseverance under the pressure of evil or iron sufferance of inevitable calamity .
