-- and if that lazy Mr. Max do n't come down in ten minutes , I vow I will lock up every thing . 
Let him get his breakfast where he can . 
He is the laziest , idlest -- '' `` Brother Max sits up studying , cousin . '' 
`` Not abusingme , brother Max , '' said Barry . 
said Max , with an air of astonishment ! 
She kissed Barry , who came forward timidly : but when Mr. Max offered the same compliment , she seized her cup and threatened to discharge its contents upon him . 
Max , upon mature consideration , retreated . 
`` Nina , you are dreadfully cross this morning , '' he said ; `` I really thought just now you were going to bite Barry ; and now you threaten to scald one of your most devoted admirers . '' 
`` Max , '' said Nina `` you are positively the idlest , most indolent person I have ever known in my life . '' 
Max helped himself to a roll . 
he exclaimed . 
`` I ca n't deny that , Nina , '' said Max with his mouth full , `` but you know I was up late last night studying -- '' `` Studying what ? '' 
`` Max , I 'll thank you not to address me as your ` darling , '' ' the young girl said , pouting , `` keep that for Miss Josephine ! '' 
Max seemed astonished . 
`` I care more for you , Nina , '' said Max , `` than for any body in the world -- a few people excepted . '' 
`` Oh yes , you will : for you know Nina , '' said Max , coaxingly , `` you are always so good to me -- every body is , for that matter . '' 
When all the town is agog on the subject , and talking -- '' `` Of Mr. Max Courtlandt and Miss Sally Myers . '' 
`` Well -- hum , '' said Max , with a conceited air , `` suppose they do talk of us . 
`` For you see , '' said Max , with a business air , `` shoes and buckles would not be in keeping , as they say . '' 
`` Let me get through , '' continued Max . 
Max had guessed rightly . 
`` Indispensable , '' groaned Max , shaking his head , sadly . 
`` I am really afraid , Nina , you will have to furnish all , '' said Max , piteously . 
`` Yes , yes , I suppose it is , '' said Max , `` how could you ? 
Max let his head fall , mournfully . 
`` Nina , I desire to kiss you , '' said Max , `` in no other way can my gratitude -- '' `` Come a step nearer and I 'll burn you with this hot water . '' 
Max , who had risen and approached his cousin , drew back . 
`` Well -- another time , '' he said , `` and now I am going to see Aunt Courtlandt . 
`` Max , you are the most impudent fellow in the world . 
No , but I am going to the ` Sisters of Mercy ' to see Aunt Courtlandt . '' 
Josephine and myself like each other : but I assure you nothing serious has passed between us , '' said Max , gravely . 
said Max , tenderly . 
But Max Courtlandt was too well bred and graceful to swagger -- in the common acceptation of that word . 
His gait was jaunty and swinging ; but neither affected nor pompous : it was the easy , careless carriage of one who is a favorite with every body , and Max Courtlandt was certainly such a person . 
With the little things Max was a prime favorite -- in fact with every body , spite of his restless and mischievous bent of mind . 
That he had his full proportion of this latter amiable quality the reader will perceive in due course of time . 
Max found Monsieur Pantoufle -- so he was now universally called -- in a very great passion , striding up and down his studio , as he liked to call it , and overturning at every round either a music stool , a chair , or a pair of foils , of which several pairs lay scattered about upon the tables and stands . 
cried Max , thinking his bet with Nina already lost . 
he added , seizing a foil and throwing himself into an attitude ; `` I will stick him , I will transfigurate him like an ortolan on a skewer ! '' 
said Max , suddenly . 
`` Monsieur Pantoufle , '' said Max , `` perhaps I can help you to get rid of it . 
`` Wait till I return , Monsieur Pantoufle , '' said Max . 
And putting on his hat , he ran out of the room , leaving the fencing-master in profound perplexity . 
Maxran as fast as he could until he had reached the tailor 's , so fearful was he that some one had already purchased the coat of his imagination . 
He was convinced that his only chance to become its happy possessor was to anticipate the whole eager community . 
It was hanging up in the window : Max breathed and went in more calmly . 
he said , `` good morning , Mr. Barlow : take it down , I want to see it . '' 
`` It is so , '' said Max , examining it , and wistfully passing the laced cuffs through his fingers , `` I think I should like to have that coat myself . '' 
`` I think really I should , '' said Max thoughtfully , and in a melancholy tone ; `` but I ca n't , I 'm afraid . '' 
Max shook his head , with a sad smile . 
he said . 
Max shook his head , sighing . 
Fifteen dollars , '' murmured Max wistfully , `` let me try it on , Mr. Barlow . '' 
The tailor helped him on with the coat . 
`` I never saw any thing so becoming , '' said the tailor `` Not fashionable , though , '' suggested Max , smiling , and looking at the cuffs . 
It is a pretty coat , '' said Max , admiring himself in a large glass , `` and what nice lace . '' 
`` It will just suit , '' continued Max , and stretching out his arm , he muttered ``` Tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet ! '' ' 
said Max , waking up from his revery . 
but provisionally , Mr. Barlow -- contingent on a negotiation I am about to undertake , '' said Max , smiling , `` I really must have that coat . '' 
grand monarch coat , '' said Max , smiling , `` and I shall , therefore , Mr. Barlow , consider this coat promised to me ; is it not ? '' 
`` Well , I 'll come for it -- fortune favoring me , '' Max said ; and he returned much relieved to Monsieur Pantoufle . 
Monsieur Pantouflehad recovered a portion of his habitual equanimity . 
The numerous `` sacres , '' he had uttered were so many safety valves for his pent up anger . 
He had replaced under his arm the indispensable cocked hat which in the torrent of his wrath had fallen to the floor , and was amusing himself by making passes at a wooden figure representing a man which stood near his harpsichord -- which exercise he accompanied with many stamps of the feet and contortions of visage . 
`` Oh , I 'm but a boy : you are a great traveler , '' replied Max with a bow still lower . 
Now , I think , I could prevail on aunt Courtlandt to let her scholars take dancing lessons . '' 
`` There are forty or fifty , '' continued Max ; `` now say thirty take lessons . '' 
Monsieur Pantoufle stretched out his arms , and embraced the young man . 
he cried . 
cried Max , taking up in his fingers a portion of the fragrant powder . 
cried Max laughing . 
Max sat down with a laugh . 
Max rose from the operation with a delicious feeling about the coronal region , and snuffing in clouds of delicate perfume . 
It seemed to him that some magical influence had suddenly converted him into a large bouquet , redolent of a thousand odors . 
He looked in the large mirror ; a snow storm seemed to have descended on his long curling hair , and on his shoulders . 
`` O , '' cried Max , putting on his hat , `` how sweet it is ! 
`` And now good morning , Monsieur Pantoufle , I must go to aunt Courtlandt 's . 
`` And so I will , '' said Max to himself , as he went out , `` though I didpromise only to get my head powdered . '' 
AsMax Courtlandt passed by Mr. Barlow 's door , his jealous eye fell upon a gentleman who , with his hands stuck in his pockets , was occupied in gazing intently on the celebrated coat . 
Max felt all the jealousy of a lover , when the heart of his mistress is endeavored to be alienated from him . 
On approaching nearer he discovered that this man was an acquaintance , and no other than the individual who had been pointed out by his prophetic imagination as the rival he would probably encounter in his attempt to seduce into his possession the much coveted coat . 
`` Yes , it is , '' said Max . 
cried Max . 
`` Try it , '' said Max , getting angry ; `` it is mine , sir , and you shall not lay your hand on it . '' 
cried Mr. Barlow , coming out of his shop , `` what 's all this about -- quarreling , gentlemen ? '' 
`` I have no desire to quarrel with any one , '' said Max , `` but -- '' `` Well , Mr. Huddleshingle , I am ready . '' 
asked Max . 
Max burst out laughing . 
`` Hans , '' he said , offering his hand , `` I beg your pardon for my rudeness ; but I thought you were bent on depriving me of my coat . 
`` You were near it , '' said Mr. Barlow , laughing , while the young men shook hands -- Max cordially , Mr. Huddleshingle phlegmatically ; `` but I had promised to keep it for you , had I not ? '' 
Max , forgetful for the time of his `` negotiation , '' was about to enter the old ante-revolutionary building -LRB- `` where the court-house stands , '' the act incorporating Martinsburg says -RRB- , when a hand was laid on his shoulder , and a hearty and firm voice uttered the words , `` Well , Max , how is it with you to-day ? '' 
He who had thus arrested Max , was a tall , gaunt , powerful man , of a slightly stooping figure , clad in a hunting shirt , and old weather-beaten slouched hat , originally brown , now of no particular color , but a mixture of all . 
`` How is it with you , Max ? '' 
`` Thank you , sir , I am very well , '' said Max , respectfully , `` I hope all are well in Meadow Branch . '' 
said Max , joyfully . 
There were but two or three persons in existence who were complimented by any diffidence , felt on the part of Mr. Max Courtlandt in their company ; the old hunter was one of these -- a man whom Max respected much . 
When he ventured on a joke , therefore , Mr. Max , uttered a profoundly respectful laugh . 
exclaimed Max , with sparkling eyes . 
Max blushed . 
The hunter shook his head . 
`` Injuns , Max -- blood-thirsty child-killers . '' 
The hunter 's eye flashed , and his brown , weather-beaten face , flushed . 
`` I have never got over that , '' he said , `` and though the whole earth is most nigh changed , and there 's no danger , you see my old gun travels about with me like it used to . 
Come Max ; they do n't see us . '' 
And they left the court-house just as that legal gentleman , Mr. Lyttelton , compared by Max to a solemn owl , began to shake the walls with his indignant thunder . 
Max touched Barry and said laughing : `` Pretty sight is n't it , Barry ? '' 
she said ; `` and I do n't know what I 'll look like in the play with Mr. Max -- besides being so scared ! '' 
I most know it now , and Mr. Max showed me , yesterday , how to kill myself . '' 
`` She 's to make out she kills herself , sir , '' said Max , laughing . 
`` Come to our house , and we 'll send Barry for her , sir ; or if Barry wo n't go , '' said Max , laughing , `` I 'll go myself for Miss Juliet . '' 
The old man assented to this , and left them , his gun under his arm . 
`` Oh yes , Mr. Max ! '' 
`` Oh , ai n't you afraid , Mr. Max ? '' 
`` She isdreadful , '' said Max , `` a regular old ogress : but she 's my aunt , Sally : I must not abuse her . '' 
And Max leaving the children to finish their stroll in the direction of Tuscarora brook , took his way toward the abode of the ogress , Mrs. Courtlandt . 
Max had called it a convent ; he was not far from the mark , since Mrs. Courtlandt the superior , had the reputation of being very strict in her ideas of a superior 's duties ; and scarcely ever permitted the young ladies -- Protestant and Catholic -- placed under her care to receive visitors from the town . 
This redoubtable castle , commanded by this terrible ogress , as Mrs. Courtlandt was reputed to be -- whether justly or unjustly we shall see -- Max was on the point of taking by assault . 
He ran up the steps and gave a thundering knock . 
A neatly dressed servant girl , her face composed into a prim and grave expression , replied to his summons ; but at sight of Max this primness disappeared , and the grave face relaxed into a smile . 
cried Max , gayly . 
`` Who do you want to see , Mr. Max ? '' 
asked the girl , laughing ; `` not -- '' Max drew himself up . 
`` Miss Prudence , '' he said , `` I am surprised that you -- a staid New England lady -- should ask me such a question . '' 
`` That you said somebody else was prettier , Mr. Max . '' 
`` Why , I came here to see aunt Courtlandt . '' 
Mr. Max , '' whispered the girl , `` she heard every word I said ! '' 
`` Certainly she did , '' replied Max , coolly . 
And leaving Miss Prudence somewhat abashed , he entered the apartment where the dreaded Mrs. Courtlandt waited to receive him . 
`` Well , Max , '' said Mrs. Courtlandt , rising from her seat , `` pray what were you saying to Prudence about ` nice people ? '' ' 
`` Oh , aunt , '' said Max , taking the offered hand with a mixture of affection and respect , `` you heard us , did you ? '' 
continued Max , desiring , like a cautious diplomatist , to sound the depths of the enemy 's knowledge . 
`` That was you , you know , aunt , '' said Max , laughing . 
Max had forgotten this small circumstance . 
But you must have heard my reply to Prudence -- who , by-the-by , aunt , is a remarkably pleasant young lady ; I never saw less of the ducnna -- you know the maids in Spain are called duennas -- I 've been reading a novel lately , all about that -- and -- '' `` What a tongue you have , Max ; you talk too much ; but , after all perhaps it is better that the excess should be in that than in the other direction . '' 
`` If I could only turn out a credit to the family now , aunt , '' said Max , smiling . 
`` I think you will , Max , '' his aunt replied , with an almost affectionate glance at her nephew , `` you are a great rattle-trap , but have very good sense . '' 
said Max ; `` I 'm already engaged in a suit -- though not exactly at law . '' 
Max looked round on this heterogeneous assemblage of his school day tormentors , and blest his stars that he was no longer a child , and among his childish things had put away algebras and geographies . 
`` I like electricity and geometry , aunt , '' Max replied , `` and that is nearly all . '' 
`` I did not mean that -- you know Max , that I have never been opposed to harmless diversion . '' 
`` Aunt , '' said Max , `` I do n't think you observed how elegantly my head is powdered -- did you ? '' 
My dear aunt , you know you -- '' `` No flattery , Max -- recollect it is thrown away on me ; -- how can you be so foolish . '' 
And Monsieur Pantoufle powdered my hair , because I said I was coming to see you -- how obliging in him ! '' 
said Max , laughing . 
`` Why , you must have given him love-powders -- he so punctilious -- '' `` I gave him something better than love-powders for his hair-powder , aunt . '' 
`` I gave him a promise . '' 
I promised to recommend him to you for a dancing-master -- to teach all those charming and graceful young damsels hopping about out there in the garden how to lance ! '' 
At that moment Max heard a subdued `` hem ! '' 
behind him . 
He turned round , and found himself face to face with Miss Josephine Emberton . 
said Max , `` is it possible a young lady as old as yourself jumps the rope ! '' 
`` Wouldbe , Miss Josephine , you should say , '' Max replied ; `` the thing is not arranged so nicely yet as you seem to think . '' 
`` Pray , what has Mr. Max to do with our dancing , '' the young girl said , `` I suppose it is one of his usual airs . '' 
cried Max ; `` I have a great deal to do with it , Miss Josephine . 
so you know Monsieur Pantoufle , Mr. Max ? '' 
`` He is one of my best friends . '' 
Max received this raillery with great coolness , and replied : `` You might have used the words of Portia , ` I pray you know me when we meet again , ' but that reminds me , Miss Josephine , of a matter of business . 
cried Max , impatiently `` if you interrupt me whenever I speak . '' 
`` And the idea which has occurred to me , '' continued Max , with a business air , `` is for you girls to raise a subscription to buy my dress . '' 
`` Give me a slate and pencil , '' continued Max , `` and we 'll figure it out . '' 
Josephine handed him a slate . 
He sat down and wrote on the left hand , `` Romeo 's Dress '' -- on the right , `` Subscribers . '' 
repeated Miss Josephine , bending over him . 
Max 's eye wandered mournfully over his aunt 's figure , and endeavored to ascertain whether report had rightly charged her with wearing boots . 
Then he heaved a second sigh . 
`` I really do not know what to call that , aunt -- '' said Max , conceiving at the very moment a nefarious intention in the depths of his heart . 
But now Max , tell me what all your moralizing about the importance of costume -- and boots -- and people 's opinions -- signifies . 
`` Why certainly , the scene lies in Verona -- but what connection -- '' `` I know what you would ask , aunt , '' interrupted Max , `` how does this connect itself with costume . '' 
Max heaved a deep sigh . 
But after all , the price is fifteen dollars , '' added Max , mournfully . 
`` I think I shall kiss you again , aunt , '' said Max , `` how good you are to me ! '' 
Perhaps Max would have carried this threat into effect -- but at the moment when he moved toward Mrs. Courtlandt , the mischievous face of Miss Josephine appeared in the framework of the door . 
Max drew himself up . 
`` I am surprised , Josephine , at your asking such a question , '' he said . 
`` My dear Josephine , '' said the young man , taking from his breast a small locket , `` do you see this ? '' 
And having uttered this dignified speech Mr. Max Courtlandt made a profoundly respectful bow to the young girl and went away merrily jingling in his pocket the donation of his aunt . 
He felt all the refined satisfaction of a man who has made a stately and graceful speech , and performed at great self sacrifice a most disinterested action . 
As with a distrustful lover , so with Max . 
He counted out to Mr. Barlow the fifteen dollars , received the coat compactly wrapped up , and joyfully took his way home , there to exhibit his purchase to his cousin . 
Nina was sitting in the middle of the room : Max threw the bundle on a chair and crying , `` There it is ! '' 
But he suddenly checked himself : Nina had a visitor . 
This gentleman was no other than that Mr. William Lyttelton , whose legal thunder had assailed Max 's ears when he left the court-house . 
What had brought this legal gentleman to see Nina , Max was completely at a loss to understand ; but he was soon enlightened on the subject . 
`` I have thought it unnecessary to have a summons served upon Mr. Von Horn by the proper officer -- '' he said : `` O , that is not necessary sir , '' broke in Max in a business tone , `` you know it is left entirely to -- '' `` Pardon me for interrupting you , sir , '' said Mr. Lyttelton with the ghost of a smile , `` what you say is very just . '' 
`` I am studying law , Mr. Lyttelton , '' said Max consequentially `` and we of the profession -- '' `` Max , you are detaining Mr. Lyttelton , '' said Nina laughing . 
`` Oh , not at all , '' observed that gentleman smiling ; and although he had taken his hat , he lingered a moment . 
Max burst into a laugh as soon as the door had fairly closed . 
he said . 
`` Now , observe this Mr. Lyttelton , '' continued Max philosophically , `` he is a mere lawyer -- a walking volume of his namesake old Coke Lyttleton . 
There is my quarrel with him ; he is utterly unsocial -- business alone is his god -- miserable business , '' said Max , as if the very word were distasteful . 
`` On your honor now , Max ? '' 
`` On my honor , madam , '' said Max , bowing and laying his hand on his heart . 
`` Not at all , Nina -- he insisted on it , contrary to my wishes , '' said Max , `` but it seems to me there was a bet . 
`` Look for yourself , '' said Max , running up-stairs . 
I will send Max down to entertain you -- I am so stupid , I could not . '' 
`` I am glad Max was not here , '' said Nina to herself , when her visitor had disappeared . 
`` He would have challenged Mr. Huddleshingle on the spot , '' she added , laughing . 
And Nina returned to the bundle , as Max came out of his room , waving the new cap and shouting , `` What a glorious , splendid feather ! '' 
Theyoung man entered in triumph , his long curling locks surmounted by a handsome velvet cap , from which floated a magnificent black feather . 
`` Nina , '' said he , `` you are a peerless woman ; I could not have desired a more beautiful cap than this . 
cried Max , snapping the string and pulling out the richly finished coat , `` did you ever see any thing more beautiful ? '' 
`` Ah , thereby hangs a tale , '' said Max , facetiously , `` I have been unremittingly engaged in pursuit of that coat since I left you this morning . 
Max drew himself up . 
`` I wonder , Mr. Max , if girls are not women two years before boys are men . 
`` True , true , I had forgotten that , '' returned Max , `` it is undeniably true ; in fact I have always said so . '' 
You girls are like flowers -- we men , '' continued Max , with easy nonchalance , `` are like trees . 
`` It was made for Monsieur Pantoufle , '' said Max , prevaricating , `` but Barlow sold it to me . '' 
Max continued . 
said Max coaxingly , `` it will go off so much better . 
Max sat down dejected . 
`` Well , I suppose I must abandon it , '' he said , sighing , `` but I had set my heart on it . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Max , mournfully , `` but I could bear the disappointment but for one thing . '' 
But let us dismiss the subject , Nina , '' said Max , much dejected . 
`` Max , you are the most ridiculous person in the world , '' said Nina , `` what are you sighing so for ? '' 
asked Max , sadly , `` I did feel some disappointment . '' 
`` I think I might change my mind , Max , if the piece was what I would like . '' 
cried Max , brightening up ; `` oh ! 
cried Max , waltzing her round the room ; in the course of which proceeding , he came with a whirl up against that sable matron , aunt Jenny , who just then entered with a pile of dishes . 
`` Have done , Max ! '' 
`` I 'm glad I did not , '' said Max , `` for I am getting very hungry . 
Max was nowhere to be seen . 
Old Courtlandt the tall , up there '' -- the hunter pointed to a portrait hanging over the fire-place -- `` and me , went out often in the woods here when I was a boy , and many a narrow escape we had . 
Where 's Max ? '' 
I 'm sure grandfather Courtlandt up there , would stop any such thing : we should see his ghost , '' replied the young girl , laughing . 
Mr. Max , has shown me how . '' 
`` What a wild dog that Max is , '' said the old man , `` the idea of his selecting you : why not take Nina ? '' 
`` Max arranges every thing , '' said Nina , `` Mr. Huddleshingle must not apply to me . '' 
And Nina devoutly resolved , that Max should have his orders to exclude Mr. Hans , that very evening . 
`` Whata dream I have had , '' said Mr. Max Courtlandt , waking with a laugh , two or three days after the scene in the last chapter . 
Certainly , '' he added , `` there was some sense in dreaming about them , since having attained all the other articles for my dress , the coat , the cap , the feather , the waistcoat , the ` silken hose , ' as the nice folks call them , and the sword -- there now remains but a single thing to find . 
-- That is my boots , '' continued Max , thoughtfully . 
Max sprung up and dressed ; this operation somewhat interrupted the train of his reflections . 
I can not buy , for my money is all gone , and I will not ask uncle for any more , or aunt Courtlandt either . 
`` Aunt Courtlandt ! '' 
asked Max of himself in the glass . 
said Max , resolutely ; `` faint heart never won ought yet . 
Max entered . 
`` Oh , good-evening , aunt , '' he said , `` I knew I should find you unemployed . 
`` I do talk too much , aunt , '' said Max , `` but exercise , walking , and all that , is good for one , you know . '' 
cried Max , breaking off , `` the place to play in is changed . 
said Max , audaciously . 
`` Whom she came to see , '' added Max . 
`` Well , Miss Josephine , '' said Max , `` we will not quarrel '' -LRB- indeed , it was necessary , as the reader will perceive that he should remain on the very best terms with Miss Josephine -RRB- , `` we will not quarrel about that . 
`` Do come and play for us , most respected of your sex , '' said Max , `` Josephine , or Miss Josephine dances so nicely ; the harpsichord will do . '' 
Max relented from his purpose , and half crushed a small object in his pocket . 
`` I do repent me , '' murmured he , dejectedly . 
But at that moment he caught sight of the magical boots on his aunt 's feet , as she slightly lifted her skirt to ascend the step leading to the parlor . 
Max advanced to the spot where Josephine with a stately air had taken her seat too , and with one hand on his heart bowed low , and requested the honor of treading a measure with her . 
consented , giving him her hand . 
Max and Josephine danced well . 
His bows were very elegant , and full of chivalric and profound respect ; -- her courtesies -LRB- each fair hand holding up her skirt , stretched gracefully to its full width -RRB- , replete with winning grace , and , as Max inwardly decided , the very poetry of motion . 
They approached each other for the final movement , Max with an elegant mincingness in his gait , Josephine gliding with the pleasant , stately music like some little fairy queen . 
Then it was that Max took from his pocket a small , neatly folded note , and as he extended with graceful ease his hand , slipped the said note into Miss Josephine 's , where the full ruffles falling down , concealed it . 
`` Just in time , '' muttered Max , `` I do repent me still ! '' 
`` Nor to Max . 
-- I observed the elegance with which he approaches and gives his hand -- '' `` Oh , my dear aunt -- '' `` And how elegantly you , Josephine , receive it . 
Max with terrible doubts upon the subject of his note , felt that this was a dismissal from the convent . 
He therefore took his leave , with many misgivings , and returned homeward . 
Once in his room he began to reflect whether his aunt had discovered his surreptitious act -- or whether his guilty conscience had given an imaginary meaning to her words of parting -- these were the questions . 
He was thus sunken fathoms deep in thought , when he heard himself called by Nina . 
he said opening the door with a look of quiet , and profound sadness . 
`` Here is a message from aunt Courtlandt , '' said Nina . 
`` From aunt Courtlandt ! '' 
murmured Max , with guilty fear , `` bid the messenger ascend . '' 
Max took it . 
Max ran up to his room and tore open the bundle . 
His aunt 's boots ! 
Max tore open the note : therein he read the following : `` You are very foolish Max . 
cried Max , `` to think of being so completely done up by her . 
And Max tried them on . 
Max sat down admiring them . 
`` Seriously though , aunt Courtlandt is an excellent woman , '' said he . 
cried Max , reassured -- `` but these elegant boots -- theyare nojoke ! '' 
TheThursday , on the evening of which Max was to make his first appearance on any stage , arrived in due course of time . 
All Martinsburg had assembled at the announcement -- elegantly dressed ladies , radiant with rich falling lace , and supporting on their white foreheads curiously fashioned towers of hair ; gracefully attentive gentlemen with powdered locks , stiff-collared coats , and silk stockings and knee-buckles ; shop-keepers , countrymen , and in the obscure distance , behind all , no slight sprinkling of laughing ebon faces ; -- such was the audience which Mr. Max , out of his abundant good-nature , had consented to appear before , when the regular examination was gone through with . 
If our readers have come to the conclusion , that Mr. Max Courtlandt was only an ordinary `` rattle-trap , '' with a voluble tongue , a handsome face , and a faculty of coaxing persons into doing what at the moment he desired them to do , they have done that young gentleman very great injustice . 
Max Courtlandt 's was no ordinary mind ; to a facility in taking impressions on all sides , he united an individuality of character , as distinctly marked as any even the most unmistakably individual in that vast audience . 
He seemed careless , thoughtless , light in temperament as the down of the thistle tossed about hither and thither by the slightest breath of wind ; -- in reality , no more sadly thoughtful mind , when his exuberant health did not fire his blood , could be conceived . 
Max Courtlandt was no common jester ; he often uttered with a laugh , sad truths . 
He was no mere wheedler of people , as Nina said ; from a low opinion of human nature , practicing on its foibles ; true , he saw through these foibles and made merry with them ; but a kinder , softer , more hopeful , humanity-loving , humanity-admiring heart could not be found . 
It was a long time before order could be restored , or a hearing for the after-piece -LRB- as Max pompously called it -RRB- , was thought of as attainable . 
It is not necessary for us to minutely trace Nina through her light comedy part , as we have done Mr. Max and little Sally , seduced by their remarkable performance on this occasion . 
Max was , if not a prophet in his native country , at least a hero for the moment . 
Miss Josephine Emberton , at least , was of this opinion ; and in coming out , Max read in her admiring looks , and her unusual quietness of manner , the effect his tragic performance of the part of Romeo had produced upon her feelings . 
he said . 
`` Happy chevalier , if I am yours , '' said Max . 
`` But I must have a token of my lady 's favor : -- all knights have , '' said Max . 
Max took it with a profound bow , and placed it in the pocket of his Romeo coat -- which he had not removed -- nearest his heart . 
Actors -LRB- even actors in private theatricals -RRB- are , it is well-known , very partial to suppers , and Max seemed to have gained an excellent appetite , for material things , from feeding so full of grief , in his character of Romeo . 
cried Max , with his mouthful , `` I was astonished , to hear her speak her part so well ; the best of it is , too , that the whole was her own , I did not teach her . 
`` Let Barry alone Max , '' said father Von Horn , `` he was right , and I honor him for his chivalric conduct . '' 
`` Certainly : did he not think the child had killed herself ? '' 
`` And Mr. Max most scared me , when he was fighting , you know : I most screamed . '' 
asked Max . 
`` You seemed so much in earnest , Mr. Max , '' said Sally , nestling close to her father , with her little bright eyes fixed upon the young man . 
cried Max , `` why , I was in earnest . 
`` I mean , I forgot the company and all , after the first minute , my dear , '' said Max . 
`` Oh , Mr. Max ! '' 
`` Do n't mind him , Sally , '' said Nina , `` he always tells stories . '' 
`` By-the-by , Nina , '' said Max . 
`` You did yourself considerable credit , '' said Max , patronizingly . 
`` Max , you joke eternally , '' said father Von Horn , who listened to this jesting conversation with great amusement ; `` I say Nina , that you played excellently -- quite as well as my nephew . '' 
said Max , `` I would give any thing in the world to go and hunt a few days with you , sir ! '' 
`` But my law -- uncle says -- '' `` I 'm afraid you are neglecting it , Max , '' said father Von Horn . 
`` Well , neighbor , if you must , you must , '' the old man said ; `` and I suppose Max might as well go and get this acting out of his head . 
On the stairs Max passed Nina , who went up last , carrying in her dainty hand her japanned candlestick . 
`` I say , Nina , '' said Max , `` do n't be married before I get back . '' 
Think of me often , Juliet -- Nina , I should say , '' Max continued dolefully , and casting a tender glance upon his cousin ; `` think of me often ; not in the dim watches of the night alone , when ` even the stars do wink as ` twere with over-watching , ' but even when the ` garish day ' is bright , and you are surrounded by the most gallant cavaliers -- the sprightly Lyttelton , and gay Huddleshingle . 
Max also retired . 
Max made ready to accompany him ; leaving with Nina many messages , and running about , with all the delight of a boy who has a holiday granted him , and the vision of woods and mountain-slopes before him . 
Romeo and Juliet ; Josephine ; Monsieur Pantoufle 's fencing lessons -- all were forgotten , and Max , with his impulsive temperament , saw for the moment nothing but guns , and hunting knives , and powder-flasks : -- heard but the barking of the dogs , which frisking and wagging their tails , and leaping about , uttered at intervals , sonorous bayings , eloquent of mountain-side adventure . 
If Max forgot Romeo and Juliet , however , hunter John , only half imitated him . 
He remembered Juliet . 
But Max jested with her , and made her laugh , and the dogs bayed more loudly , and good-by being said again , they mounted their horses . 
cried Max , with sparkling eyes , `` Oh , what a glorious sight , the fall woods are -- and the deer ! '' 
Theindividual who monopolizes the whole conversation in an assemblage of many persons , his talk flowing on like a river which nothing can check , and absorbing such chance sentences as others utter , as easily and gracefully as a large stream absorbs into its bosom the little rills : -- such a talkative personage , despite every thing , is apt to grow wearisome at last , and miss that attention which other more silent individuals command . 
We are afraid that the sayings and doings of Mr. Max Courtlandt have filled too large a space in these pages , and that the reader will very willingly good-speed him on his journey to the mountains . 
Mr. Huddleshingle , with all his virtues , his peculiarities , his devoted admiration for our heroine , will now take his rightful place in this narrative , and perhaps act a more prominent part than Max has hitherto played , figure in a more striking catastrophe , than that which we have described as occurring at the `` Globe : '' -- Mr. Lyttelton , that solemn devotee of legal lore , and prospective rival of our hero in the affections of Nina , will have due attention paid to his wise words and looks : -- all the ` neglected peronages ' finding the coast clear , and the silence no longer invaded , by that merry laughter , full of joyous pride , will take their rightful stations -- usurped no longer -- in our comedy . 
Max had gone away with a gay jest , beseeching Nina not to lose her heart to Mr. Lyttelton , that walking law-book , before he returned from his visit to the mountains . 
Max knew not the sad consequences which were to arise from his suggestion to Nina , in relation to the after-piece . 
Had he dreamed of such a thing , we doubt whether the young man would have taken so much pains to persuade his cousin to appear in it . 
Her fascinating appearance on that interesting occasion -- beyond the least doubt -- fashioned and `` shaped the ends '' of her after life , more powerfully than Max had dreamed they could . 
Days and weeks glided away , and Max , absorbed in his mountain sports , did not return . 
Nina was not sorry for his absence , since she would have experienced some awkwardness had he been present , and for a very simple reason . 
Mr. Lyttelton was now her avowed suitor ; that gentleman called to see her every day ; the house was full of his presents -- some of them exceedingly elegant and costly : in a word , a new chapter had opened in the book of Nina 's existence ; and that new chapter might not be very much to her cousin Max 's taste . 
Nina was relieved by his absence -- for she felt that Max had very piercing eyes . 
If he loved her , on which point she had never been able to make up her mind , how unpleasant would be his presence ! 
-- If he was indifferent to her marriage with Mr. Lyttelton , how dreadful his bantering tongue ! 
`` Courtlandt the Tall himself , '' he muttered ; `` the child is the very image of the old man , and the portrait . '' 
`` I said you were like Courtlandt the Tall -- my father . '' 
The thought of Max had occurred to her ; and this thought made her melancholy even in the very whirl of the revelry . 
`` On the tomb of Courtlandt the Tall ! '' 
Affrighted , he had fled pursued , as he thought ; and as he fled , he heard thundered in his ears , the words , `` Courtlandt the Tall forbids this marriage ! 
-- Courtlandt the Tall forbids this marriage ! '' 
Courtlandt the Tall has arisen ! 
Courtlandt the Tall has arisen ! '' 
It had belonged to Courtlandt the Tall himself , and now it was to be used , in a possible contingency , against his derider or deriders . 
Barry obeyed trembling ; and indeed he had no sooner advanced with faltering steps into the open space in full view of the tomb than a flash of lightning revealed to father Von Horn 's terrified sight a gigantic figure standing with uplifted arms upon the grave of Courtlandt the Tall ! 
The race had been close , but the spectre of Courtlandt the Tall might even then have achieved his escape , at the pace he was going , and so returned quietly to lie down in his tomb , but for an unfortunate accident . 
We are all here now , and all are pleased that Nina has chosen so worthy a gentleman as yourself for her husband ; all of us -- with the exception of my wild nephew , Max , who appeared some time since you recollect , in the character of Romeo , on the evening of Mrs. -- 's examination . 
Max is a wild dog , but we all love him ; I hope he will be in time . '' 
The door opened , and the figure of Max appeared upon the threshold , his clothes soiled with dust , his face agitated , one hand pressed upon his heart as if to still its tumultuous beating . 
Why , what 's the matter , Max ? '' 
`` No , sir -- nothing -- '' stammered Max , sitting down moodily , `` I rode very fast . '' 
`` I wished to arrive in time , '' said Max , bitterly ; `` I thought cousin Nina might be married , as she has been courted and won , while I was absent . '' 
The old man also noticed this change in Max 's usual bearing , and said : `` Married while you were absent say you , nephew ? 
you are weary and out of humor ; get Max some supper , Nina . '' 
`` I am not hungry , sir , '' said Max , his eyes filling with tears of sorrow and mortification , `` and I could not eat . '' 
`` It has not me , '' said Max coldly . 
Mr. Lyttelton saw an opening for a joke ; he caught at it with the energy of an advocate who sees a weak point in his opponent 's case . 
`` Perhaps you are in love , '' said he smiling ; `` that I believe is fatal to the appetite . '' 
Max 's eye suddenly blazed ; and he met Mr. Lyttelton 's glance with one of such defiance that that gentleman was profoundly astonished . 
`` Max , '' he said , `` you must really be unwell , or something has put you out of humor . 
Max uttered not a syllable in denial of his uncle 's hypothesis . 
said Nina , coming forward with tears in her eyes ; `` do n't speak harshly to Max ; I know he is unwell and irritable -- you know like me so often . '' 
`` Why daughter , '' said the old man , `` I had no intention of speaking harshly to Max . 
He is not a child for me to rate for ill-behavior . 
Mr. Lyttelton , therefore , departed with scarcely any recoguition of the fact on the part of Nina ; he knew not what to think , but decided upon the propriety of jealousy , in which the handsome face of Max entered and played a distinguished part . 
Father Von Horn came back holding the candle with which he had lit his guest out , and unmistakably yawned ; then declared he felt exceedingly sleepy -- and then , having told Nina and Max good-night , without a trace of ill-humor toward the young man in his manner , retired to bed . 
Max with his head turned away took no notice of the movement . 
Nina went up to him , and took his hand . 
`` Max , '' she said in a low tone , `` are you angry with me ? '' 
Max raised his head , and a profound sigh , which seemed to relieve his heart , broke from him . 
he said , `` I did not mean to be cold to you ; indeed it would be very ridiculous in me to be giving myself airs as if I was some important person . 
`` No , you have not annoyed me , Max ; but you called me when you came in cousinNina , and I thought you were angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you , '' Max said , in a low voice . 
`` But , Max ! 
Max you distress me ; I am ready to cry and I will cry in a minute if you do n't tell me what youare so distressed about . 
Is it -- can it be -- Max , can it be ! 
said Max , rising . 
For a moment their agitated glances met ; Max leaning , pale and statue-like , against the tall mantle-piece , Nina standing upright without the power of moving . 
the storm has subsided -- will subside in time , I hope , wholly ; I will try to curb this foolish agitation which is only food for laughter -- '' `` Oh , Max -- Max ! 
And leaving Nina in tears , Max went up to his room . 
Once more alone his feelings , softened no longer by the pleading face of Nina , were lashed again into tumultuous waves . 
He recalled those ironical words of Mr. Lyttelton -- such he supposed them to be -- `` perhaps you are in love ; '' he treasured up that gentleman 's cool smile , and at the end of half an hour had made up his mind that he had insulted him . 
Striding up and down the room , agitated by a thousand thoughts , Max could , after hours of thought , determine upon nothing . 
The dawn found him still pacing up and down . 
He took his hat and descended , meeting in the dining-room with aunt Jenny . 
Max caught at this with sombre pleasure ; and smiling scornfully left the house ; on what errand we shall discover . 
Ateleven in the forenoon of the eventful day , on the morning of which we have seen Max leave his uncle 's , and on the evening of which Nina was to give her hand away to Mr. Lyttelton , M. Pantoufle Xaupi , or as we have elected to call him -- therein sustained by general usage -- M. Pantoufle simply , called to give the young girl her last lesson in music . 
`` Very , '' said Nina , turning away , `` I have heard Max humming it a great deal within the last month : -- no , before that ; '' Nina added , mournfully . 
`` I teach him , '' said Monsieur Pantoufle , with a polite grimace . 
`` Have you seen him to-day ? '' 
`` Did he look well ? '' 
`` I mean in good spirits -- bien aise -- he was sick last night . '' 
`` Malade : was he well , I say , to-day ? '' 
`` Why , ma ` mselle , I must confess , he look badly . '' 
`` What was he doing ? '' 
`` Ah , you must ask him , ma ` mselle , '' replied Monsieur Pantoufle , laying his hand carefully upon the inside of his cocked hat , and bowing politely . 
I heard you say ` Max : ' what has he to do with it ? 
he cried , `` where is Max -- my nephew -- ho , there ! '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' Max replied , gloomily , `` I know it , for I wrote it myself ; though I do not know how you could have procured it . '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' said Max , with gloomy composure , `` to Mr. William Lyttelton , and to the worthy gentleman who yesterday played a disgraceful trick upon your family . 
cried the young man , losing his calmness , and speaking in a voice of great bitterness , `` this thing went too far ! 
Max said , through his teeth . 
Max stood overcome with a thousand emotions ; anger , jealousy , mortified pride , and bitter sorrow by turns raged in his heart . 
His eye fell upon Nina , whose bosom was shaken with a storm of sobs . 
And Max hurried to his chamber . 
Closing the door , he sat down in great agitation ; and for a moment strove to collect his bitter and wandering thoughts . 
Then seizing a pen he commenced writing . 
As he wrote his agitation changed slowly into a sombre melancholy . 
Then a few tears gathered in his eyes and ran down upon the paper . 
In a quarter of an hour he rose , leaving the sheet open upon the table . 
He looked for some minutes around him , at the old familiar objects ; a profound sigh or rather a groan , burst from his heart : and he went out slowly . 
Descending to the stable he saddled his horse -- the gift of his aunt -- mounted , and just as dusk began to fall upon the quiet town went forth toward the south . 
Immediately upon his return father Von Horn asked for Max and was informed that he had gone to his chamber . 
Then it was that father Von Horn , having heard nothing of Max , determined to go and seek him . 
His eye fell on the letter Max had written ; and foreboding something , with that instinct of the heart whose wonderful power so often displays itself , the old man took it , and read it hurriedly , with many heavy sighs and mournful shakings of the head . 
The old man hesitated , but obeying a sign from Mrs. Courtlandt : `` I do n't know , children , '' he said thoughtfully , `` what makes me so mindful of this now ; but as sister Courtlandt has promised you a story I will tell you one . '' 
`` I would be as happy as I could be in this world , '' said Barry , `` but I am afraid , '' he added with mournful gravity , `` that brother Max will never come back again . '' 
I am here now -- that brother Max ! 
The tears gushed from his eyes , he embraced the old German , hunter John , Sally , Nina and as many young ladies as came in his way -- to their profound consternation ; and declared to every one that this was the happiest day of his life : that foolish doctor Thomas Maximilian Courtlandt ! 
Itwill not be necessary for us to describe the rapture of father Von Horn and Barry , and Sally , and indeed every one , at the return of Max Courtlandt so long lost and now come back to them , healthy vigorous and joyful . 
That the wild young Max should return the elegant cavalier , the calm and self-poised man they saw before them : that he could have so changed as not to be recognizable by those who had loved him and lamented him so long , was most marvelous . 
Silence reigned once more on the mountain side , and Max -- now Doctor Max -- related in a few words , the outline of his adventures after leaving Martinsburg . 
said hunter John , `` that this fine Doctor I have been talking to so much of late , was nobody but wild Max , after all . 
I 'm most nigh unbelieving yet -- in spite of what he says . '' 
`` Are you as bad as ever , Max ? '' 
`` What a joker you still are , Max , '' Nina said . 
The old man now was satisfied ; he could die in peace he said , with Max to take care of his dear daughter ; and should we never again in this brief history recognize that cheerful face , or listen to that hearty loving voice , we may at least be sure that that true loyal soul , was now once more most happy . 
Max was again the son indeed of his fond uncle ; and Nina gave her whole heart to him -- Nina so merry but so earnest in her tender love ; so changeable but ah ! 
`` Come , Max , '' said the elder traveler , cheerfully , `` let us get on . 
`` Pretty , '' said the elder traveler , `` are they not , Max ? '' 
`` No , sir , '' Max said , smiling gently , `` of children . '' 
`` The association is so strong , '' murmured the young man , bending down his head . 
His companion looked at him a second time with that tender yet piercing glance we have described , but made no reply . 
`` It lies in a great degree with the individual , independent of the character of his past , to make them pleasant or sombre , Max , '' his companion said . 
`` Ah , what a dreamer I am becoming , '' he said , `` here I have been guilty of just what I have berated Max for ; I have engaged in irrational melancholy musings about things and scenes gone into the far past -- which might as well be gone into oblivion -- ` What 's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba ? ' 
`` Max , '' he said , at length , `` you have much distressed me by again yielding to these feelings . 
`` Enough , Max , '' he said , `` come , we will leave this place , for you are really unwell . 
`` I and Max , aunt Jenny , '' said the stranger , taking her hand , `` we have come back . '' 
My name is upon it -- Doctor Maximilian Courtlandt . '' 
A servant ran to take their horses , overwhelmed , it seemed , with joy to see his master come back to the old house , and at the door Doctor Courtlandt was received by no less a personage than Mrs. Courtlandt , the severe , the stately `` Aunt Courtlandt '' of his youth . 
The gray-haired old lady received her nephew with extreme delight , clasping him in her arms and affectionately kissing him with a thousand inquiries after his health and spirits -- which latter subject elderly ladies usually place much stress upon -- then she turned and welcomed the young man with equal pleasure and affection . 
Doctor Courtlandt and his son had been absent for a long time ; in fact they had left Virginia soon after Mrs. Nina Courtlandt 's death , which had taken place some years before . 
The chief reason for this expatriation on the part of Doctor Courtlandt and his son , will appear in the course of our narrative . 
The old lady , having cried over Max , and given him several very affectionate kisses and embraces which he returned as affectionately , busied herself about their dinner . 
`` Are you hungry , Max ? '' 
Is she not , Max ? 
Max smiled . 
`` You know I always thought aunt was young-looking , sir , '' he said . 
`` Max and myself were always great friends , '' said Mrs. Courtlandt , `` and now dinner is ready . '' 
`` I confess I am hungry , '' said Doctor Courtlandt ; `` come , Max . '' 
Max took scarcely any thing ; the consequence was , the doctor , spite of his manful declaration of hunger , could swallow nothing . 
Come , Max , my boy ; again en route . '' 
`` This interferes with our ride , Max , '' said Doctor Courtlandt : and raising his voice , `` my horse ! '' 
The messenger whom Doctor Courtlandt had stopped riding post haste , had somewhat exaggerated his mistress 's sickness . 
Doctor Courtlandt very soon made his diagnosis of the malady , and told Miss Emberton that she would be well in three days . 
He mounted his horse , and slowly took his way back to the Lock , admiring the beautiful sunset and the splendid autumn woods , which , like an army with a thousand glittering spear points and many-colored banners , proudly reared aloft , stood waiting for the wind 's loud trumpetblast -- the signal for dire conflict with old winter . 
Then his thoughts , for a moment thrown back on his past , returned to the patient he had just left . 
`` Ah , '' he murmured , `` what a wondrous thing is life ! 
The Doctor 's head fell mournfully on his breast ; his memories had overwhelmed him for the moment . 
`` I , '' he murmured , `` who have loved so much , and -- though I put on dissimulation like a mask -- so profoundly always ! 
Onthe next morning Doctor Courtlandt descended to breakfast buoyant and smiling , and gayly rubbing his hands . 
He bade Mrs. Courtlandt and Max , who were already down , a hearty and cheerful good-morrow . 
`` Why , Max ! '' 
he said , `` you already show the mountain air . 
't is almost indispensable to one who has drawn it in with his first breath -- been ` brought up to it , ' as the phrase goes . 
Max received his father 's congratulations on his good looks with a listless smile , but replied , that he thought he was quite well . 
You can not imagine what horrible weather we had , aunt , '' he continued , turning to Mrs. Courtlandt who was superintending the arrangement of the breakfast table , `` and as you never were at sea , I believe , you can not form any idea of that most disagreeable rollingof the vessel . 
See this pearl colored coat I have on : it was the pride of a Parisian tailor -- La Fère , rue Grenoble , you recollect , Max -- well , the water we shipped gave it these pleasantly variegated tints : see on the shoulder . '' 
`` Yes , yes , my dear aunt ; and Max stood it like a hero -- a real hero -- delicate as he is . 
I believe his heroic bearing , though , was somewhat owing to the fact that he had to keep up the spirits of a nice young lady he met with on board . '' 
Max smiled sadly . 
`` He was a great beau on board , aunt , '' the Doctor continued , `` but I see breakfast is ready ; let us sit down -- come , my boy ! '' 
`` All forced , aunt , '' Doctor Courtlandt replied , sadly smiling , with a covert glance at Max , `` but speaking of merriment , I am going to have a dinner -- do you feel equal to it ? '' 
Have you any friends , Max , you would like to see ? 
`` I do n't know that I have , sir , '' said Max , `` I was so young when I went away , and lived so much at home and in town , that -- '' `` Well , well ; in future you will mix more with the world . 
Max smiled . 
`` I do n't think I could ever make a speech , sir , '' he answered . 
`` I like the backwoods better than Paris , sir , '' said Max , smiling . 
At the same moment the noise of wheels was heard on the hard road , and going out into the portico , brilliantly illuminated by the rosy sunlight of the beautiful October morning , Doctor Courtlandt saw his brother getting out of his small covered carriage . 
Beforethe Doctor could so much as ask his brother how he was , a gay voice from the carriage exclaimed : `` Oh , uncle Max ! 
oh , uncle Max ! 
`` Yes -- here are your bad little children , '' said Caroline , laughing and springing at one quick bound into the arms that were opened to receive her , `` I 'm very bad yet , uncle Max ! 
`` Where 's cousin Max ? '' 
`` There , on the porch ; he will be delighted to see you . '' 
`` But I wo n't kiss him , '' said Caroline , pouting and shaking her head , `` I am too old now to kiss cousins . '' 
`` Maybe he wo n't ask you , '' said Doctor Courtlandt , delighted , `` but never mind , Iwill always kiss you , that will console you . 
Come , Alice dear , there is your father already shaking hands with Max . '' 
`` Here are the girls , Max , '' said the Doctor . 
Max with a slight blush stepped forward gracefully , and inclosed the two young girls in his arms . 
`` You know , '' he said , smiling , `` this is mere French form ; I could not assent to your being too old , cousin Caroline -- nor you , cousin Alice . '' 
With which words Max very calmly kissed both his cousins . 
`` Go make Max 's acquaintance , girls , '' said the Doctor , `` you would find a walk out on the hill side , or mountain rather , a much more pleasant pastime , than a chat here with an old man of science like myself . '' 
`` Somewhat , brother , '' said the Rev. Mr. Courtlandt in his soft voice , `` she was afraid of the ride in the cool air , though she was longing to see you . '' 
`` Why , Max will do as much , niece ; ask him . '' 
Max , with his hat in his hand , stood quietly aloof . 
All his momentary vivacity had disappeared , and his face had fallen back , so to speak , into its old , sad , listless expression of weariness and melancholy . 
`` Will you not , Max ? '' 
Max bowed slightly . 
Come , Max is waiting ; go and walk . 
The young girls and Max saw that the brothers wished to converse alone , and so without further parley left them . 
The Doctor and the Rev. Mr. Courtlandt gazed at each other with much feeling , separated as they had been so long . 
The Doctor then in the same manner gave an account of his `` life and adventures '' since their parting ; and then the conversation turned upon Max . 
`` Max is still listless and melancholy , '' said the Doctor , `` you know this was the reason for my expatriation so long . 
I do not think he is much better , and I have returned with a smile on my lip , but much sadness in my heart , to the old scenes here , with the hope that the society of friends and relations will work some change for the better in his spirits . '' 
Jenny , the old nurse , you know , grew garrulous and agitated Max very much -- though God pardon me , I thought he could not be more deeply affected . 
Max enjoyed the stroll very much ; the fresh air seemed to enter into his blood and vivify it . 
His cheek brightened , he smiled often , and catching from Caroline the contagious buoyancy of her own spirits , became more cheerful than he had been for years . 
`` Horrid , cousin Max ! 
Max smiled . 
he asked . 
`` If he said you were dull he showed very little taste , '' said Max , gallantly , `` you are any thing but dull , cousin Caroline . '' 
`` Thank you , cousin Max ; you have been traveling , and now you come to make your pretty speeches to us country girls . '' 
`` Why , that is not a pretty speech , '' said Max , smiling , `` only the truth . '' 
Max 's face , clouded . 
`` No , '' he said , `` but very low spirited . '' 
Max 's momentary sadness disappeared before these merry and joyous words . 
`` You have a great many pleasant things in store for me , cousin , '' he said , smiling . 
Max shrugged his shoulders : had Doctor Courtlandt seen that shrug he would have been overjoyed . 
`` You must teach me , '' he replied , with a smile and a glance of admiration at his cousin . 
Max 's countenance assumed its old listless expression of melancholy gravity . 
`` See what a beautiful primrose up there by the golden-rod , cousin Max , '' she said , pointing to a rock which over-hung , like a miniature precipice , their path , `` gather it for me , please . '' 
`` With pleasure , '' said Max , and after considerable trouble , he brought both the primrose and the golden-rod , from their places on the steep side of the mossy rock . 
Get some more , cousin Max . '' 
`` What a fine color you have now , cousin Max ! '' 
she added , `` and how much I am obliged to you , cousin Max . '' 
Oh , uncle , see my pretty flowers , which cousin Max collected for me . 
He is an elegant beau ! '' 
`` Cousin Max is gallant , too , '' said Caroline , '' very gallant . '' 
`` How could I be otherwise with you , '' said Max , laughing and bowing . 
cried the Doctor , overjoyed at seeing his son so animated , and his cheeks so healthfully red , `` she has you there , Max ! 
Come you may take myarm , Carry , as you and Max have quarreled . '' 
As for Max , he promised to ride over in the afternoon . 
`` Oh , uncle Max , '' cried Caroline , `` how glad we all are you have come back again ! 
`` Max 's coming . '' 
`` What has the arrival of Max to do with your jealousy ? '' 
`` Max shall be my beau . '' 
`` Oh , Max likes me well enough , '' she said , `` and as he is a much nicer person than Mr. Robert Emberton I will have him for my cavalier . '' 
`` Max is not very well , '' he said , `` but you have it in your power , Carry dear , to be of very great service to him . '' 
`` How , uncle Max ? '' 
`` By coaxing him out of his reserve and melancholy . 
If Max was happy he would be as stout as a plowman . '' 
`` Is he unhappy , uncle ? '' 
It would make a new man of me were Max to grow gay and cheerful -- try now and amuse him . '' 
`` Indeed I will , dear uncle , '' said Caroline , tenderly , `` and on your account , for I dearly love you , uncle Max . '' 
We are to have a dinner in three or four days , and this , with your society will , I trust , wean Max from his melancholy thoughts . 
He requires to be interested -- employed ; if he is idle and has not congenial society he is gloomy . 
We met little such abroad , and I am afraid our long residence in Italy was scarcely a benefit to him . '' 
Mrs. Sally Courtlandt received them -- the same tender , earnest loving face of old times -- the same soft voice which had filled the long past years , for many there , with music . 
But perhaps the young man 's unusual respect was more still to be attributed to the accounts he had heard of Doctor Courtlandt from his sister -- more than all , possibly , to the long travel of his new acquaintance in distant lands ; for Mr. Robert Emberton had but one ambition , which ambition was to visit that centre of civilization -- Paris . 
`` Yes ; cousin Max . '' 
He therefore , simply bowed , and requesting Monsieur Pantoufle to accompany the party , wrapped his surtout around him , and returned homeward , thinking of Max . 
Caroline and Alice were seated by Max and Mr. Robert Emberton : and Miss Emberton was the centre of attraction among the fair dames who bloomed in long rows on the right and left hand of the host . 
At the foot of the table -- or more properly the head -- sat Mrs. Courtlandt , the Rev. Mr. Courtlandt and his wife . 
Alice observed with pain that Max ate scarcely at all ; and this was only not observed by other persons from the fact that the young man was kept very busily talking : he and Doctor Courtlandt were the two centres to which a thousand questions tended , throughout the whole banquet . 
`` Come , Mr. Emberton and you , cousin Max , '' said Caroline , `` you must not stay drinking wine -- you must come and walk with us on the hill side . '' 
And accompanied by Max , Alice , Caroline and a number of young ladies , the unfortunate victim of ennui went forth . 
Max was silent and even gloomy . 
Alice looked at him timidly . 
`` Cousin Max , you do not seem well , '' she said , bashfully . 
I think you and cousin Max are the dullest beaux I have had for an age . '' 
Max , by a strong effort suppressed his gloom , and turning to the young girl whose bright glance flashed like an arrow to him : `` What did you say , cousin ? '' 
he asked , smiling sadly . 
`` Well , '' said Max , `` I will endeavor to behave better . 
Alice glanced at Max and Caroline who were talking gayly -- Caroline at least . 
Max seemed already to have thrown off much of his gloom . 
`` Indeed , '' said Mr. Emberton bending down to her ear gallantly , and taking the opportunity to throw a glance upon Max and Caroline , `` I was never more sincere in my life . '' 
`` Yes , you were looking at sister and cousin Max while you were answering me ; and scarcely knew what you were saying . '' 
`` Oh , cousin Max has been giving me such a nice description of Italy and Rome ! '' 
`` Has he ? '' 
said Alice in a low voice , `` I could not get you to talk with me , cousin Max . '' 
`` I have talked very little , '' said Max , with a long look at Alice , `` and indeed very prosily . 
`` There they go , '' said Caroline to Max , with a somewhat ironical look , `` I am very glad you secured me from that fine gentleman , cousin Max , with his eternal talk of being bored -- he is excessively disagreeable . '' 
`` Do you dislike him , cousin ? '' 
asked Max , looking at the person he alluded to . 
`` There are no sunsets in the world equal to our mountain ones here , '' said Max , going through the same ceremony as his cousin . 
`` I observed none , scarcely , '' said Max , asking himself why he had not before observed how fond Alice was of Mr. Emberton , upon whom she was at that moment sweetly smiling . 
`` You are not thinking of me that 's plain , cousin Max , '' she said . 
Really , Mr. Courtlandt will think me a most unfortunate individual . '' 
`` You are very fortunate I think , sir , '' said Max , `` you are in good spirits and amuse cousin Alice . 
`` Oh , Cousin Max ! '' 
`` I only mean that I am really very low-spirited and dull , '' said Max , grieved at the hurt expression of the little tender face , `` Indeed I am always , and am a poor entertainer . '' 
You , cousin Max , with Alice and I with Mr. Emberton ; thought I know I should have got the worst of the bargain . '' 
The Doctor had been much grieved at Max 's melancholy in the earlier part of the day . 
The Rev. Mr. Courtlandt and his wife with the young girls departed last . 
`` Very agreeable , dear uncle , '' said the young girl , looking at Max . 
Max smiled and sighed ; the Doctor caught the sigh in its passage . 
`` Max , '' he said , `` how has it been with you ? '' 
`` And very sincere , '' said Max , looking at Alice , `` that is its only merit . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Alice with a bright smile , `` cousin Max promised to bring me something -- though I had to tease him for it . '' 
`` I promised -- '' began Max . 
`` Max may take you what he chooses to take you ; but you shall take away a kiss from me . 
You must come and bring what you promised , cousin Max , '' said Alice ; and so the last of the guests departed . 
And Doctor Courtlandt dressed with the ease and rapidity of an old traveler ; and gay , light-hearted , ready to break his jokes upon any one who approached , descended to the breakfast room . 
Max was already there bending over a portfolio which lay upon his knees . 
His long fair hair half covered his face , as he sat with his delicate profile turned to the door by which his father entered , and the red , cheerful light of the crackling twigs in the fire-place -- only a handful , to dispel the morning chilliness -- brightened his eyes , and mingled itself with the clear sunlight streaming through the window opening on the east . 
Max raised his face ; he was smiling . 
`` I could not bear to lie in bed on such a lovely morning , sir , '' he replied . 
`` It is very beautiful , '' said Max , putting on his hat , and placing under his arm the portfolio . 
Max stood rapt with the beauty of the fair October morning ; and for the first time felt that autumn was not necessarily so sad . 
His eye sparkled , his cheeks filled with blood , and his eye drank in rapturously the whole beautiful landscape . 
`` No , sir ; '' Max replied with a smile , `` I believe I am getting hearty again . 
`` Good-morning , '' said the old lady , who was counting the keys in her large key-basket , `` why , Max , you look uncommonly well . '' 
`` And I have an excellent appetite , aunt , '' replied Max , laughing . 
Max , as he said , had an excellent appetite ; and so overjoyed was the worthy Doctor at seeing his son thus recovering his strength , that they had no sooner risen from the table than he suggested a bout with the foils . 
Max went up stairs to procure them . 
Just as he left the room a merry voice was heard at the door , crying , `` Good-morning , good folks ! '' 
`` Aunt Courtlandt , how well you look after all the worry yesterday . 
`` Certainly ; where is my agreeable cousin Max ? '' 
You did not come to see me -- but Max . '' 
`` Come , come , '' said the Doctor , `` I foresee you will spend your indignation on the unfortunate Max -- a kiss will make us good friends again . '' 
The caution came too late ; -- Caroline , full of life and merriment -- a merriment which reddened her cheeks and danced in her sparkling eyes , sprang forward so quickly , that the long skirt she wore got beneath her feet , and she fell forward -- not into the arms of the nice old man , her uncle , but into those of Max , who at that moment entered with the foils and masks . 
he cried , `` there is a nice present Miss Caroline makes you , Max ; thank her . '' 
`` Especially to such a dull fellow as myself , '' said Max . 
Max smiled , and took his foil , without paying any attention to his cousin 's raillery . 
Well , I 'll bet cousin Max that you throw his sword out of his hand in half a minute . '' 
`` Take the bet , Max , '' said the Doctor . 
`` I am afraid you will , sir , '' Max replied , laughing . 
`` Done , '' said Max , putting on his mask . 
said Doctor Courtlandt ; and Max placed himself in position . 
So take care of your weapon , Max . '' 
Max grasped his foil with an experienced hand , and , throwing back his hair , fixed his eyes upon those of his father , and crossed his weapon . 
`` You are dead , '' said Doctor Courtlandt ; `` see , Max , on your heart ! 
`` I never felt better in my life , '' replied Max , laughing . 
said Doctor Courtlandt , rubbing his arm , `` you have a good wrist , Max . '' 
`` I appeal from Miss Courtlandt out of humor to Miss Courtlandt pleased , '' said Max , laughing , and taking the little cap with its black feather . 
`` That is right , Max , '' said the Doctor ; `` compel her to comply with the conditions of the bet . '' 
`` Max , do you go over this morning ? '' 
And with these words the young girl , holding up her long skirt , went out , followed by Max , who bore in his hand the riding-cap . 
`` That depends upon your behavior , cousin Caroline , '' said Max . 
Max followed , and took his place at her side in excellent spirits , and anticipating a delightful visit . 
He saluted the young lady with negligent politeness , and drew up . 
Therefore , '' added Mr. Emberton quickly , lest Max should have an opportunity of assuring him that his father was at leisure , `` I will continue on my way to the Parsonage . 
Doctor Courtlandtstood watching Max and Caroline as long as they were in sight , with a well-pleased smile upon his thoughtful face . 
But the one great fact which remains , is this -- Max is better , stronger , gayer , more lively . 
He no longer mopes , though his sadness has not entirely left him , and he still thinks too much . 
What a glorious fellow Max would be were his spirits once back again ; what a wrist he has ; well , we will trust to time , and new scenes . 
But where is Max ? '' 
`` There he is coming , '' said Mrs. Courtlandt . 
Max saluted his father and aunt , and after a few listless words again put on his hat , and carelessly walked out upon the hill . 
He bent his way to the spot where they had wandered along on that beautiful evening -- himself his cousins , and Mr. Robert Emberton -- and reaching the moss-covered rock upon which Alice and her companion had seated themselves , stopped moodily . 
He had gone from home on that morning , happy , joyful , full of an `` unaccustomed spirit , '' which had `` lifted him above the ground with cheerful thoughts . '' 
Mr. Emberton throughout the whole day -- Max reflected with bitter enmity -- had attached himself to Alice , and this on the avowed ground that Caroline had quarreled with him , and for the time had declined to accept his overtures of friendship . 
He , Max , had attached himself perforce to that young lady , and in consequence a drama was enacted , of which the former scene upon the spot he now occupied was but the rehearsal ; a drama full of mistakes , misunderstandings , explanations , and complaints . 
This possibility made Max at the same time wrathful and wretched . 
If such werethe case what right had he to complain , he asked himself . 
`` Yes , sir , '' murmured Max , `` shadows -- for they darken my heart . '' 
`` More , more is coming , Max , than darkness and cold , and the chill biting wind ! 
Doctor Courtlandt had become now quite a regular visitor at the Glades , and indeed Miss Emberton had found the little whist parties , which were gotten up by him for her amusement , a very acceptable substitute for the usual listless `` reading aloud '' of her brother , in the long winter evenings . 
M. Pantoufle even , now domiciled at the Glades , gained a new interest from his former acquaintance with such a man . 
At the Parsonage , Mr. Robert Emberton and Mr. Max Courtlandt were very constant visitors . 
The young men often drove over to ride the ladies out in their sleighs ; and this tacit rivalry had in a great degree served to remove Mr. Emberton 's listlessness , and Max 's melancholy . 
Max and Mr. Robert Emberton , enveloped in their comfortable surtouts , leaned opposite each other against the mantle-piece . 
Not one of the party looked at any other member of it , and Max assisted Caroline into his sleigh without betraying his disappointment . 
Mr.Emberton and Alice , inasmuch as their sleigh was before that of Max and Caroline , took the lead ; and in a few moments -- so rapid was their flight -- the whole party arrived at and commenced the ascent of the Third Hill mountain , cutting through the heavy snow drifts , darting along on the hard frozen portions of the road , and every moment rising higher above the little valley which they could already , from their elevated position , overlook throughout its entire length and breadth . 
Not that Caroline disliked Max ; on the contrary she was very fond of him ; but only in that cousinly degree which is so far removed from any softer feeling . 
Max 's eyes , if the truth must be told , were also fixed upon the sleigh in advance of them , much more frequently than upon the beautiful girl at his side . 
We know his secret at least -- if that of other persons is not so plain ; and it must be confessed the young man had felt a very acute disappointment , at the accident which had prevented him from having the charming ride he had promised himself with Alice by his side . 
`` See what a glorious day , cousin Caroline , '' said Max , `` here we are on the mountain top , and yonder is the North Mountain which we must also cross before we can swoop down on Martinsburg . '' 
`` Delightful , '' replied Max . 
`` And at this rate we will swoop down on Martinsburg in a little while , as you say , cousin Max . 
`` There are no chickens in town equal to our mountain ones , '' said Max , laughing . 
`` You are welcome to your portion , cousin Carry , '' said Max , absently . 
`` Certainly , I deny it , '' said Max , slacking his rein and thereby increasing the speed of the already flying sleigh . 
said Max , turning round with some embarrassment and fixing his eyes on his cousin 's laughing face . 
Max laughed and colored slightly with the consciousness that Caroline had fathomed his abstraction ; Caroline burst out laughing . 
`` You were not thinking of me , cousin Max , '' she said , `` you were thinking of Alice . 
Max blushed and turned away his head from his cousin . 
he muttered . 
`` Certainly , '' said Max , smiling and regaining confidence . 
Max adroitly turned the conversation . 
`` We are coming to the stream , '' said he , `` I suppose the ice will bear us . 
This manœuvre was distinctly perceived by Max and Caroline , and without thinking of the conversation they had just had , they both uttered an indignant exclamation . 
`` For this person -- '' muttered Max , throwing a wrathful glance at Mr. Emberton 's sleigh . 
`` It was not Alice 's fault , '' said Max . 
Caroline was not the person to inform of his intention to call Mr. Emberton to account . 
`` But this is not a bridge , '' said Max . 
Max turned full upon his laughing cousin , and smiled satirically . 
he said , with a meaning look . 
`` Come , dear cousin Carry , '' said Max , `` do n't let us quarrel ; I never mean to hurt any one 's feelings . '' 
`` Then let us strain a point , and turn the ice into a bridge ; '' said Max , as they darted at full speed on the smooth surface , `` a cousinly kiss to make friends ! '' 
`` No , I suppose not ; Max could tell us . '' 
`` Mr. Courtlandt with Miss Caroline , and yourself consequently bored by your humble servant ? '' 
There is that elegant young traveled gentleman , Mr. Courtlandt , whom you have missed ; your cousin too -- cousins are so agreeable , you know , '' said Mr. Emberton with some gloom . 
`` And Max thinks as much of me , '' said Alice , turning away her head . 
Conspicuous among these handsomely decorated stores was that of our old acquaintance , Mr. Barlow ; that Mr. Barlow who had promised faithfully on no account to sell the Romeo coat to any one but Max , in the old times , merry and long ago . 
He was still the obliging and worthy gentleman he had proved himself on that occasion ; full of very cheerful smiles , and ready to unroll for all who entered his broad door , his various attractive cloths and silks and velvets . 
The young girls stopped first before his door ; and the gallantry of their cavaliers was quite obscured by that of Mr. Barlow , who assisted them to the broad , well-matted door step with profound and most engaging courtesy . 
Mr. Emberton 's manner lost a little of its languor , and he glanced quickly at Max . 
Mr. Emberton became jealous and gloomy , and from time to time cast ill-humored glances at both Max and Caroline . 
Let us now see how Alice had got on with her purchases at the other end of the counter , where a polite shopman -- overwhelmed and confounded by her soft voice and the tender beauty of her little face -- outdid himself in the rapidity with which he complied with her demands . 
`` Grandfather will be pleased I know , cousin Max , '' said the young girl , `` with what I have for him this time . 
Max , looking tenderly but anxiously at his cousin , made no reply . 
Alice said something to the shopman in a low tone which Max did not catch ; and the overwhelmed and confounded knight of the yard-stick -- the most gallant and disinterested of men -- hurried to obey . 
He took down a roll of silk . 
asked Max , taking up the handsome piece of stuff . 
The polite shopman heaved a deep sigh -- he was a captive forever . 
`` You mean I may ask , but that you will not tell me , '' said Max . 
`` I 'm afraid it 's no joke to me , '' said Max , laughing . 
`` You quoted the children just now , '' Alice said , laughing too , `` well , I will answer as the children do -- it is for laroes to catch meddlers , cousin Max . '' 
Max glanced round , and his eyes fell on Mr. Emberton . 
`` Your silk is for a waistcoat , cousin Alice , '' said Max , his merriment suddenly changing to mortification and gloom . 
asked Max , in a mortified tone . 
`` Yes , cousin Max , '' said Alice , in a low voice . 
Max gently bowed his head , making no reply ; then he turned away without heeding the hurt and embarrassed expression on Alice 's lovely face , for she had with those jealous eyes of hers , noted his mortified tone and sudden gloom . 
The knight before mentioned heaved a sigh so piteous and profound , that `` it did seem to shatter all his bulk . '' 
The whole party left Mr. Barlow 's , and once more entered their sleighs -- Mr. Robert Emberton and Max exchanging moody glances , Alice and Caroline scarce knowing what to think . 
Max bought an elegant bracelet . 
`` They are for Alice ; '' said Caroline to herself , with a most engaging pout , `` I know they are ; she said the other day , and he heard her , that she was about to bore her ears . 
This time Max and Caroline were in advance Theyapproached the steep side of the North Mountain , whose ten thousand stalwart pines bent down beneath the heavy snow-burden resting on their branches ; and commenced the ascent , lost in admiration of the scene , so still , so desolate , but so replete with beauty . 
Alice looked annoyed ; then indifferent `` They were written by cousin Max , '' she said , `` and I have no objection to your seeing them , as you have already read a part . '' 
And after this compendious monosyllable , Mr. Emberton fixing his reins securely in one hand , betook himself again to reading Max 's verses . 
He had just reached the lines , `` The trees were dyed In evening 's crimson tide , Rolled far and wide Along the merry mountain side '' when an exclamation of affright from Alice made him drop the paper , and grasp suddenly the loose rein he had allowed to slack too much . 
Max and Caroline in passing over the ice , now rendered unsafe by the gradual thawing it had throughout the day been subjected to , had almost broken through the bending crust , near the very centre of the stream . 
Max whirled his horse round and hurried back to the rescue of the party , just as Mr. Emberton , by a violent blow of his whip , forced his horse , the sleigh , and all through the icy water , and the broken ice , to the bank . 
`` We made signs , sir , '' said Max , austerely , `` you might have seen them . '' 
`` I beg that you will have more care when such shall be the case in future , sir , '' said Max , indignant at Mr. Emberton 's coolness and indifference . 
Alice blushed , and looked at Max timidly . 
`` He was reading your verses , ` The Mountain-side , ' cousin Max , '' said Alice , softly , `` they happened to -- '' `` Is it possible you allowed them to be made a laughing stock in your presence , cousin Alice , '' said Max , in a tone of profound mortification , `` and by Mr. Emberton ? 
They took leave of the family now -- both the young men -- and Max was about to get into his sleigh when he felt a finger on his shoulder . 
Max drew himself up haughtily . 
`` I had the right to say what I did , sir , '' he replied , `` and if any thing I think I was forbearing -- very forbearing . '' 
`` You touched my shoulder I believe , as I was getting into my sleigh , '' said Max , haughtily . 
Max 's eye flashed ; `` As you please , sir ! '' 
Mr. Emberton looked at his adversary with a scornful curl of his proud lip ; and after a moment 's silence said : `` I could pardon your incessant attempts to render my visits here disagreeable , sir -- I could pardon these attempts on your part if -- '' `` What do you mean , sir -- I confess I am at a loss to comprehend you , '' replied Max , coldly . 
Max caught at the last words uttered by his adversary , and replied with equal bitternes : `` A gentleman who has never stood in my path ! '' 
Max overcome with rage , advanced two steps toward his adversary , looking at him with burning and flashing eyes . 
Max suppressed his anger , and said with as much coldness as he could command : `` I have nothing to retraet , sir . '' 
`` You seem fond of riddles , sir , '' said Max . 
Mr. Emberton dug his nails into the palms of his hands ; as for Max he had nearly bitten through his upper lip . 
Mr. Emberton advanced close to Max . 
Max replied haughtily : `` Very well , sir . '' 
After these bitter words , Mr. Emberton made Max a low bow , which was returned as ceremoniously , and both got into their sleighs just as Caroline and Alice appeared at the door . 
Max took his way to the Lock , overwhelmed with bitter thought . 
Alice was lost to him ! 
How fond and foolish he had been to dream of her ! 
Max ground his teeth . 
Onthe morning after the scenes we have just related , Doctor Courtlandt was sitting in the breakfast-room before breakfast , perusing a letter which had just been brought to him from the post-office , when Monsieur Pantoufle made his appearance , shaking from his slippers and shoe-buckles , the snow which those ornamental rather than useful articles of dress had gathered , in their passage from the owner 's horse to the mansion . 
Max had returned on the previous evening gloomy and silent , and had retired earlier than was his wont , overcome it seemed by some afflicting emotion . 
Doctor Courtlandt had taxed his brain to account for this gloom of the young man 's ; had run over in his mind the events of the day before -- Max 's visit , his meeting with Mr. Robert Emberton , for the sleigh ride had been arranged some days before , and he knew Mr. Emberton was to be of the party , his delight on setting out in the morning , his gloom on returning at night . 
The Doctor had been completely puzzled ; but now a sudden light seemed to flash upon him ; the very moment Monsieur Pantoufle , after making his customary bow , asked in a ceremonious tone for Max , he began to understand . 
`` I see a note there in your waistcoat pocket , Monsieur Pantoufle , '' he said , `` pray is that for Max ? 
Max entered ten minutes after Monsieur Pantoufle 's departure ; his father had already formed his resolution . 
Maxwas still gloomy and taciturn -- his heart lacerated , his eyes red and heavy with want of sleep . 
He had been revolving all through the long wretched hours of the weary night the events of the day before ; and he could come to but one conclusion , to but one opinion of his cousin 's feelings . 
Doctor Courtlandt slipped the note brought by Monsieur Pantoufle into his pocket , and said with a smile to his son : `` Good-morning , Max ! 
Max took it . 
Max made no reply `` I am afraid to trust them to the cars without some one to take care of them , '' continued Doctor Courtlandt . 
repeated Max . 
Max raised his heavy eyes to his father and said gloomily : `` You must excuse me , sir ; I really can not go . 
`` I mean , my dear father , '' Max said , tremulously , `` that I am not fit for the commission -- besides I really am kept here . '' 
There was nothing so fearful to the young man in the whole universe as his father 's displeasure . 
And for the very simple reason that this displeasure was never manifested harshly , in word or tone , did Max on this occasion feel an instinctive dread of that obstinate silence with which the Doctor had met his excuses . 
`` Father -- '' `` Enough , my son -- if you do not wish to go to New York -- '' `` I will go , '' murmured Max , `` I did not mean to refuse to go , sir . '' 
Max saw from his father 's tone that any further opposition would be distasteful to him , and with a sound between a sigh and a moan , he replied : `` Well , sir -- I will go to-day then . 
Max went to his chamber and sat down at his writing desk . 
Having penned this warlike epistle , the young man neatly folded it , and sealed it -- to omit nothing -- with the old Courtlandt coat of arms , venerable relic of antediluvian Courtlandts , dead and gone many a day , after doing many things of a description very similar , and equally as unchristian as that just performed by their descendant ; then directing it succinctly to `` Mr. Robert Emberton , at the Glades , '' he left it lying on his table ; this done , he hastily packed up his traveling valise , took it under his arm and went down to his father . 
Breakfast was a mere ceremony on the part of both father and son ; and , in an hour , Max was pursuing his way through the deep snow to Martinsburg , there to take the cars for New York Maxhad no sooner departed , than Doctor Courtlandt ordered his horse -- preferring that conveyance to the more comfortable sleigh -- and took his way toward the Glades , the note to Mr. Emberton in his pocket . 
`` Mr. Courtlandt forced me to send it . '' 
-- he so gentle , so observant of all the courtesies of life ? '' 
`` I find no fault with his temper , sir , or his breeding ; though I had a very disagreeable specimen of them yesterday . '' 
`` Max insult you ! '' 
`` I might have passed by Mr. Courtlandt 's harsh words , sir , '' murmured the young man , gloomily , and applying to his particular case the general principle of his inter-locutor , `` but we are rivals ! 
Doctor Courtlandt looked inexpressibly pained , and pressed his hand upon his breast . 
he said mournfully . 
`` Yes , sir ; there is the cause of this thing which you complain so of ; not those trifling words he uttered . '' 
Itwas on a pleasant sunny morning toward Christmas that Max , having performed his father 's business in New York , again returned to the Lock . 
Max sat down motioning to the servant to leave him . 
That name had opened his wounds anew , and now hatred was added to his other mental excitement . 
That abhorred rival had for a time vanished from his mind -- from his heart so overwhelmed with one thought , that Alice could not be his own ; -- she had preferred that man , she had slighted him , she had laughed at his verses , had met with contemptuous calmness his love and affliction ; it was on his despair that he had fed , not his hatred . 
On a mossy rock , which the snow had disappeared from , at the distance of two hundred yards from the house , Max saw Alice seated and busily engaged at some work . 
He dismounted , tied his bridle to a bough of one of the waving evergreens , and approached her . 
The young girl 's back was turned to him , and so completely had the soft snow muffled the hoof-strokes of his horse that she had not heard them , and was plainly not aware of his approach . 
Max thought that he had never seen a more angelic vision , a more radiant embodiment of purity , and youth , and innocence ; the very sunlight seemed to linger on the beloved head , bent down so earnestly ; and when the feeling words of her song floated to him like the low warble of a bird -- those feeling words of Motherwell : `` Oh , dear , dear Jeannie Morrison , Since we were sindered young , I 've never seen your face , nor heard The music of your tongue -- '' when Max caught the dying fall of the exquisite music , and the more exquisite words , his very heart was melted within him , and two large tears gathered in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks . 
`` Alice , '' he said softly , `` that is a pretty song . '' 
`` Do not mind me , cousin Alice , '' said Max , passing his hand over his brow , `` sit down . '' 
`` I only got back an hour or two ago , '' said Max . 
Alice stole a pitying look at him . 
echoed Max . 
Oh , how can I tell him , thought she ; he certainly loves Caroline , and her marriage will distress him dreadfully . 
`` You said something had happened , cousin Alice , '' said Max , pressing one hand on his throbbing heart , and with the other taking the hand of the young girl . 
Max 's brow flushed , and his lips trembled . 
he said . 
Max felt his heart grow as chill as though it were surrounded suddenly by ice . 
`` Speak , '' he said , coldly . 
But recollecting himself he turned away , and said in a low , suffocating voice : `` Do not mind me -- speak ; tell me all , as though I were an indifferent person . 
For a moment his voice died away in his throat . 
He continued : `` I have borne much ; I can bear this also , doubtless , though it goes near to tear my heart-strings -- what I think , nay , know . 
The young man 's head sank down , and covering his face with his hands , he tried to strangle in its passage the passionate sob which shook his bosom . 
`` Cousin Max , '' said Alice , `` I pity you from the bottom of my heart . 
Max turned away . 
he said , `` you pity me -- great God , she pities me ! '' 
`` I guessed as much , '' said Max , in the same low voice . 
Alice thought she had overrated the affection Max felt for Caroline , so calmly were these words uttered ; and this idea we are bound to say made her heart leap . 
Max turned with gloomy astonishment toward his cousin . 
`` He has thought best , however , to mortify me by following his own judgment , in choosing -- '' Max half rose . 
cried Max . 
Max could hardly believe his ears ; he looked around incredulous . 
he repeated . 
cried the young man , devouring her face with his passionate glances . 
Max with radiant countenance drew out the bracelet and clasped it on her wrist . 
he said , `` oh , heaven is my witness I would clasp my heart thus were it in my power ! '' 
said Max . 
That tender little hand remained in his , and no fine eloquent speech was needed to make him understand that the long train of errors was exploded , and the heart so faithful to him , his forever . 
Maxreturned in the afternoon to the Lock , just as Doctor Courtlandt and his aunt drove up to the door , in their comfortable sleigh . 
`` I am , sir , '' said Max , with a smile . 
`` Yes , sir , '' Max said . 
`` You have heard the news , I suppose , Max , '' said Mrs. Courtlandt . 
Since you have been away he has addressed her -- '' `` And -- '' began Max laughing . 
`` I knew it , '' said Max . 
`` Yes , sir , '' Max said with a blush , avoiding the laughing eye of Doctor Courtlandt . 
`` Alice is making a very nice waistcoat for you , Max , '' said his aunt , `` she has put a great deal of work on it . '' 
Max was glad of this diversion . 
he asked . 
Max suddenly recollected that he had seen Alice on that day , from his elevated position on the Third Hill Mountain , leave the Parsonage and take the road to the Lock . 
`` It was very kind in her , '' he said , smiling . 
`` How d'ye do , cousin , '' said Max , going up and taking her hand . 
Mr. Emberton approached Max and courteously offered him his hand . 
said Max . 
`` I am sure we are good friends now , however , '' said Max , laughing , `` and I offer you my hand and my friendship . 
Both Mr. Robert Emberton and Max were much too happy , to feel the least desire to drink each other 's blood -- a ceremony they had felt a violent desire to perform a week or two before . 
`` Have you seen your nice waistcoat , cousin Max ? '' 
`` Kissing goes by favor , '' said Max , laughing . '' 
said Max , `` there is no irony about it . 
`` Exactly , '' said Max , `` old people always spy out the weak points in an inexperienced and unsophisticated youth . '' 
This repartee of Mr. Max caused Doctor Courtlandt , who well remembered the fencing scene we have related , to burst into a laugh and cry `` bravo ! '' 
Caroline , for a moment discomfited , turned round and said to him : `` Uncle , you shall not take Max 's part against me . '' 
said Caroline , lacing her arm round the Doctor 's waist and leaning her head on his shoulder , `` Aunt Courtlandt , did you ever see a more excellent and amiable old man ; so handsome too , so much handsomer than Max ! 
Max took the hand , laughing . 
At Doctor Courtlandt 's hospitable board all his old neighbors who would leave their homes were assembled . 
Miss Emberton and her brother and Monsieur Pantoufle from the Glades were there ; and Mr. and Mrs. Courtlandt from the Parsonage -- the girls too -- and even the old worn out hunter John had come , well wrapped up in furs , to welcome again , surrounded by his friends , the advent of the time . 
Max and Alice , tranquilly happy , conversed with their eyes alone -- that eloquent and most expressive language which needs no tongue to utter it . 
Doctor Courtlandt forbade this , and advised him to remain quiet . 
The young girls left scarcely any thing to Mr. Courtlandt and his wife . 
The calm voice of Mr. Courtlandt -- that calm tender voice which sounded like a benediction -- rose in prayer for the soul which had thus passed ; and so the night came down upon them with shadowy wing , but could not take from them the light of hope . 
So they were married duly ; and soon after Caroline and Alice pledged their troth to Mr. Robert Emberton and Max , the details of whose courtships we have given very fully . 
he said . 
With which melancholy , but not bitter or complaining witicism , Monsieur Pantoufle , bowing with his old elegance , took his departure .
