But do you call me Charlie . '' 
`` I will , Charlie ; nothing like preserving in manhood the fraternal familiarities of youth . 
After a few minutes ' down-cast musing , he lifted his eyes and said : `` I have long thought , my dear Charlie , that the spirit in which wine is regarded by too many in these days is one of the most painful examples of want of confidence . 
He who could mistrust poison in this wine would mistrust consumption in Hebe 's cheek . 
`` Much too much so to be true , Charlie . 
`` And I return you the pledge , Charlie , heart-warm as it came to me , and honest as this wine I drink it in , '' reciprocated the cosmopolitan with princely kindliness in his gesture , taking a generous swallow , concluding in a smack , which , though audible , was not so much so as to be unpleasing . 
`` I see , '' said the other , with what seemed quiet appreciation , but of a kind expressing an eye to the grotesque , without blindness to what in this case accompanied it , `` I see ; and the way in which it moves you , Charlie , comes in very apropos to point the proverb I was speaking of . 
True , it is said that a man may smile , and smile , and smile , and be a villain ; but it is not said that a man may laugh , and laugh , and laugh , and be one , is it , Charlie ? '' 
`` Why Charlie , your explosions illustrate my remarks almost as aptly as the chemist 's imitation volcano did his lectures . 
`` Well now , Charlie , '' eying him with moist regard , `` let us drink . 
I protest , a freer drinker than friend Charlie you will find nowhere , '' with feverish zeal snatching his glass , but only in the sequel to dally with it . 
In the press , as in the sun , resides , my dear Charlie , a dedicated principle of beneficent force and light . 
In a word , Charlie , what the sovereign of England is titularly , I hold the press to be actually -- Defender of the Faith ! 
Such are my views , which , if stated at some length , you , Charlie , must pardon , for it is a theme upon which I can not speak with cold brevity . 
`` You have forgotten , my dear Charlie , what I told you of my previous convivialities to-day . '' 
`` I believe you , my dear Charlie . 
Mind , Charlie , I do not say it isso , far from it ; but I dosay it seems so . 
You have talked much and well , Charlie ; but drunk little and indifferently -- fill up . '' 
Then whiffing out a puff , set it down , and said : `` Well , Charlie , if what wine you have drunk came out of this bottle , in that case I should say that if -- supposing a case -- that if one fellow had an object in getting another fellow fuddled , and this fellow to be fuddled was of your capacity , the operation would be comparatively inexpensive . 
What do you think , Charlie ? '' 
`` Why , I think I do n't much admire the supposition , '' said Charlie , with a look of resentment ; `` it ai n't safe , depend upon it , Frank , to venture upon too jocose suppositions with one 's friends . '' 
`` And just in that way , my dear Charlie , is one of my little secrets now to be shown forth . '' 
`` Be not so impetuous , my dear Charlie . 
Yes , my dear Charlie , for your sake ; that you might the better prove your noble kindliness , my dear Charlie . '' 
`` Yes , '' he added , soberly picking up the gold pieces , and returning them with a chink to his pocket , `` yes , I am something of a funny man now and then ; while for you , Charlie , '' eying him in tenderness , `` what you say about your humoring the thing is true enough ; never did man second a joke better than you did just now . 
You played your part better than I did mine ; you played it , Charlie , to the life . '' 
`` You shall hear , my dear Charlie , '' answered the cosmopolitan . 
For do but ask yourself , my dear Charlie , '' lovingly leaning over towards him , `` I rest it with your own heart now , whether such a forereaching motive as Charlemont hinted he had acted on in his change -- whether such a motive , I say , were a sort of one at all justified by the nature of human society ? 
Why , Charlie , you are losing your mind . 
For brevity , you shall call me Frank , and I will call you Charlie . 
`` Charlie , I am going to put confidence in you . '' 
`` Charlie , I am in want -- urgent want of money . '' 
`` But it willbe well , Charlie , if you loan me a hundred dollars . 
`` Why , Charlie , you never used to talk so . '' 
`` Still , Charlie , was not the loan in the first place a friend 's act ? '' 
`` I must be very stupid to-day , Charlie , but really , I ca n't understand this . 
`` That , Charlie , is a fable about as unjust to the ocean , as some of Ã†sop 's are to the animals . 
`` Well , Charlie , none need you charge . 
Seeing that it is you , Charlie , gratefully will I accept the alms of the interest . 
`` And you , on your side , forget , Charlie , that as your business friend I can give you no security ; my need being so sore that I can not get an indorser . '' 
`` Since then , Charlie , neither as the one nor the other sort of friend you have defined , can I prevail with you ; how if , combining the two , I sue as both ? '' 
`` And rites , doubly rights , they are , cruel Charlie ! '' 
Oh , Charlie ! 
you talk not to a god , a being who in himself holds his own estate , but to a man who , being a man , is the sport of fate 's wind and wave , and who mounts towards heaven or sinks towards hell , as the billows roll him in trough or on crest . '' 
`` Cut me you have already , cruel Charlie , and to the quick . 
Call to mind the days we went nutting , the times we walked in the woods , arms wreathed about each other , showing trunks invined like the trees : -- oh , Charlie ! '' 
-- Charlie ? '' 
`` Help , help , Charlie , I want help ! '' 
`` So there is , Charlie . 
`` Oh , this , all along , is not you , Charlie , but some ventriloquist who usurps your larynx . 
It is Mark Winsome that speaks , not Charlie . 
But Charlie , Charlie ! 
If your purpose , Charlie , in telling me this story , was to pain me , and keenly , you have succeeded ; but , if it was to destroy my last confidence , I praise God you have not . '' 
cried Charlie , who , on his side , seemed with his whole heart to enter into the spirit of the thing , `` what has confidence to do with the matter ? 
`` But Charlie , dear Charlie -- '' `` Nay , wait . 
`` But Charlie , dear Charlie , what new notions are these ? 
`` I can not think so , Charlie ; for neither am I China Aster , nor do I stand in his position . 
The loan to China Aster was to extend his business with ; the loan I seek is to relieve my necessities . '' 
`` But I need relief , Charlie ; and so sorely , that I now conjure you to forget that I was ever your friend , while I apply to you only as a fellow-being , whom , surely , you will not turn away . ''
