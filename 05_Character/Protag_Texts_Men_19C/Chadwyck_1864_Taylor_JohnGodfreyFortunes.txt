`` I did n't mean to strike so hard , John ; do n't be mad about it . 
Why , youcould do it , John . 
`` Oh , there 's time enough for you , John , '' said Bob , consolingly . 
I tell you what , John , I 'd like to build a house for myself like Rand 's , -- heavy stone , two foot thick , and just such big willy-trees before it , -- a hundred acres o ' land , and prime stock on ` t , ; would n't I king it , then ! 
`` Put away the book , John . 
`` It 's time , John , to be thinking of making something of you . 
It seems like a heap of money , John , but I 've laid away , every year since we came here , twenty dollars out of the interest on the fifteen hundred your father left me , and that 's a hundred and sixty . 
`` It will be very soon , -- too soon for me , for I shall find the house terribly lonely without you , John . 
You , John , 'll have to hoe your own row ; and I dunno what you 're cut out for , -- maybe a minister . 
I looked up , and was so charmed by the merry brightness of the eyes which met mine that I took a pen and wrote , `` John Godfrey . 
If Godfrey would try , perhaps he might grind out something . '' 
He 'll put a stopper on you if you do n't do credit to the school . 
`` Blast me if ' t is n't John ! '' 
`` Why , John , how 're you gettin ' on ? '' 
I wish he was . 
`` Perhaps Dr. Dymond might want an assistant , '' she said ; `` you 're young , John , it 's true , but I should think you could do as well as Walton , and then you could still study between whiles . 
I pray that you may be happy , John ; but you will not forget your old mother . 
`` This is John , Amos . 
John , shake hands with your uncle , and then leave me for a little while . 
I have something to say to him . '' 
`` I am afraid , John , '' he finally said , `` that the Lord is about to chasten you . 
`` John , '' she said , `` I must tell you now , while I have strength , what your uncle and I have agreed upon . 
What kind of a man was he ? '' 
`` Yes , '' I answered , `` I remember him very well . 
I was eight years old when he died . 
He was quiet and steady . 
I ca n't recall many things that he said ; but as good and honest a man as ever lived , I believe . 
Grandfather Hatzfeld had a son , -- my uncle John , after whom I was named , -- but he never married , and died long ago . '' 
`` You 're a good fellow , Godfrey , '' said he , `` or Cousin John , if you like that better . 
The other boys , of course , noticed the difference in our relations , and it was not long before the inquisitive Thornton said , -- `` I say , Pen , how is it that you 've got to calling Godfrey ` John , ' all at once ? '' 
`` Come now , John , '' said he , -- `` out with the truth ! 
`` Now , Peggy , I guess you had better get tea ready : John will be hungry , after his ride . 
Will you come into the store , John , and look around a little ? '' 
For a little while , both were actively employed ; then , the rush of custom having suddenly subsided , my uncle said , `` Here , Bolty , this is my nephew , John Godfrey . 
John , this is my assistant , Bolty Himpel . '' 
Bolty , come here , and help John up-stairs with his trunk . '' 
Aunt Peggy waited upon me as well as she was able : that is , when her household duties had been performed , she brought her knitting and sat by the stove at the foot of my bed , asking occasionally , in a tearful voice , `` How do you feel , John ? '' 
How I used to wish that some good genius had inspired my mother to give me the name of `` Selim , '' or `` Secander , '' instead of `` John '' ! 
He laid his hand affectionately upon my shoulder , and said , with a tone in which there was triumph as well as persuasion , `` Ah , I see you are touched at last , John . 
I was beginning to collect my confused thoughts , when a lamenting female voice was heard at my ear , `` How do you feel , John ? '' 
I was patted on the back by a large , dumpy hand , and Uncle Amos said , in a hollow undertone , `` That 's right ; John , pray on ! 
`` Will you have a glass of new cider , Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
My dear , this is Mr. Godfrey , whom Ihave recommended as our teacher this winter . '' 
I was first served , the lovely Amanda kindly asking me , `` Shall I season your tea for you , Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
`` I 've sent out to the barn and down to the mill , but they do n't seem to find him , '' his wife remarked . 
He read Dr. Dymond 's letter of recommendation , and finished by saying , `` Mr. Godfrey , I believe , is ready for any examination you may wish to make . '' 
`` Mr. Godfrey , let me introduce you to the gentlemen . '' 
`` MustI , indeed , Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
I was greatly delighted on hearing one of the girls whisper , `` He 's quite good-looking . '' 
`` Mr. Godfrey , '' said Miss Verbena , `` I want you to tell me what this picture means ; shewo n't . 
`` Perhaps youwrite poetry , Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
`` He , he ! '' 
giggled Miss Verbena Cuff , giving me a poke with her forefinger ; `` he does ! 
he does ! 
Make him write something in your book , ` Manda ! '' 
and then added , aloud , `` Good night , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
She must have been very deaf , for Miss Verbena stooped down and shouted in her ear , `` Mother , this is Mr. Godfrey , the schoolmaster at Yule 's Mill ! '' 
You dowrite beautifully , Mr. Godfrey . 
Mr. Godfrey , will you set by ? '' 
`` Why , you seem to have quite a prejudice against her , Mr. Godfrey , '' said Miss Amanda . 
While I was uneasily shifting my cap from one hand to another , uncertain whether to continue the subject , or give our conversation another direction , she took up a paper which lay on the table beside her , unfolded it , and asked , with a bewitching air of pleasantry , -- `` Mr. Godfrey , do you know who ` Selim ' is ? '' 
`` Yes , indeed , -- it is lovely!I knew you must be a poet , Mr. Godfrey . 
After Burns and his Highland Mary , should be written the names of Godfrey and his Amanda . 
And Bratton tells me you 're a good hand at the school , and do credit to his choice . 
Miss Amanda immediately turned to mypage , and said , `` Oh , Mr. Rand , you must read what Mr. Godfrey has written . '' 
`` Oh , you are that already , Mr. Godfrey , '' said she . 
But we are both young , Mr. Godfrey '' -- `` Call me ` John , ' '' I murmured , in tender reproach . 
She beamed upon me a sweet , frank smile , and continued : `` We are so young , John , and we can wait and hope . 
Sep would soon notice them , and you know how he talks ! '' 
`` Selim , '' of course , must be dropped , and `` John Godfrey '' stand forth boldly as the father of his own angelic progeny ; but even then , I was not sure that the reputation would immediately follow . 
`` Ah , Mr. Godfrey . 
Mr. Godfrey , I suppose , would not be likely to have lots of visitors till midnight or two o'clock in the morning ? '' 
`` Mrs. Gamble tells me you are a poet , Mr. Godfrey , '' she said . 
Mr. Godfrey ? 
`` Oh , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
He must have heard our entrance , but neither lifted his head nor noticed us in any way until Mr. Lettsom announced , -- `` This is Mr. Godfrey , the young gentleman about whom I spoke to you this morning . '' 
`` I will try you , Mr. Godfrey . 
I blundered forth both my assent and gratitude , which Mr. Clarendon , having completed his article , cut short by conducting me to the larger room , where he presented me to one of the gentlemen whom he addressed as Mr. Severn , saying , `` Mr. Godfrey is to be set at condensing the miscellaneous . 
He will come here at ten o'clock to-morrow morning . 
Have an eye to him now and then . '' 
Mrs. Very handed me a letter , addressed to `` Mr. John Godfrey , '' in a coarse , awkward hand , which puzzled me a little until I noticed the post-mark , `` Cardiff , '' in one corner . 
`` Dear John , '' -LRB- there were volumes of withheld confession for me in that one adjective -RRB- : -- `` How pleased I was to get your beautifulletter ! 
Then I went to the opposite extreme of simplicity , and adopted `` First Poems , by John Godfrey , '' -- which the publisher , who was to lend me his imprint -LRB- I paying all the expenses of printing and binding and receiving half the proceeds of the sales -RRB- , rejected as fatal to success . 
It seemed incredible that the `` John Godfrey '' on the title-page really meant myself ! 
Copies were sent to all the principal newspapers and periodicals of Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , and to all prominent authors , inscribed on the fly-leaf : `` With the respects of John Godfrey . '' 
`` John , '' she wrote , `` do not be angry at my short letter , today , for indeedI am dreadfully afraid Sep , or Dan , or somebody suspects something.Sep asked me the other day whether I had heard from you . 
But she put out her hand to keep me away , and said , with her face turned from me , `` You must not say such things to me , Mr. Godfrey . '' 
she murmured , tenderly , with her head on his shoulder , `` Mr. Godfrey has sofrightened me . '' 
`` Never mind , '' he said ; `` you seem to have frightened him quite as badly . '' 
`` Well , John , '' Dan continued , `` I reckon , now , you 'll come over and stay with us to-night . 
I suspect he still retained a sort of phlegmatic liking for me , or at least was now satisfied that I could no longer interfere with his plans , for he slipped along the counter towards me with every appearance of cordiality , stretching out his fat hand as he cried , `` Why , John Godfrey ! 
`` I 'm glad you 've come to see us , John , '' she said , in her most melancholy tone . 
`` You look very well , John , '' said he . 
You see , John , you should have notified me in the proper way beforehand . 
At last he said , `` I ca n't well do that , John , because it a 'n' t invested separately -- it 's along with a good deal of my own . 
`` I know , John , '' he said , `` that you do n't like me overly , and perhaps you wo n't believe what I say ; but , indeed , I did mean to share the profits with you . 
`` John ! '' 
`` You 're not goin ' away , John ? '' 
Think what it would be to know her , day and night , given to him , -- to still believe that her heart turned to you as yours to her , -- to add endless pity and endless agony to the yearning of love ! '' 
Mr. Severn , who shared the honor , stated to me confidentially , `` He would n't have done it , if he did n't look upon you as one of our stock workers . '' 
`` By the way , '' he asked , `` are you the Mr. Godfrey who has just published a volume of poems ? 
`` You know you can always depend upon me , Adeliza , '' Brandagee replied , with a side-wink to me ; `` I consider myself as your fidibus.Let me present to you my friend , Mr. Godfrey , whose name is familiar to you , no doubt , as one of our dawning bards , -- ` Leonora 's Dream , and Other Poems . ' '' 
Mr. Godfrey ! 
`` No apology is necessary , Mr. Godfrey , '' she said : `` I am quite as accustomed to my poetic as to my prosaic name . 
`` Tell me now , Mr. Godfrey , '' said she , `` what is your usual process of composition ? 
If it ever comes , Mr. Godfrey , you must write my thanatopsis ! '' 
I was too much disconcerted by the mistake to set her right ; but Mrs. Yorkton , beholding us , bent down her forget-me-nots and whispered , `` And you never told me , Miss Levi , that you knew Mr. Godfrey ! 
Why did you not bring him into our circle before ? '' 
You know you are , Mr. Godfrey : you are like a bee , going from flower to flower . '' 
`` Now , Mr. Godfrey , '' Miss Levi resumed , removing her fan , `` that is a spiteful remark , and you know it . 
`` Bless you , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
It does credit to Her -- I can see that . 
A glance of his dark , questioning eyes seemed to satisfy him ; he seized my hand , and exclaimed , -- `` John Godfrey , is this really you ? '' 
`` We should not have lost sight of each other , John , '' he said . 
`` 'Till , '' said Penrose , `` come here and shake hands with our cousin , John Godfrey ! '' 
`` Areyou my cousin , Mr. Godfrey ? 
It was quite romantic , I know , and I envied him at the time . 
She lifted up her hand and gave his imperial a little twitch , by way of returning the caress , and then said , `` Edmund , my cousin , Mr. Godfrey . '' 
`` You have a very passable den , John , '' he remarked , darting a quick , keen glance around my room ; `` rather a contrast to our bed in Dr. Dymond 's garret . 
`` John , '' said he , gravely , `` do n't , I beg of you , play at words with me . 
`` Isabel , '' said Mrs. Shanks , tapping Miss Haworth 's shoulder with her fan , `` on a servi.Will you take Mr. Godfrey 's arm ? '' 
`` Just what I told you , John , '' said Penrose , striking in from the other side . 
`` Mr. Godfrey , '' said Miss Haworth , a little timidly . 
`` I 'm glad you are a match for 'Till , John , '' he said . 
`` He 'll come to that after a while ; he ca n't have all the virtues at once , '' remarked Mr. Floyd . 
You have only seen the mother 's blood in me , John . 
`` Miles , '' said Brandagee , `` another of us , -- Mr. Godfrey . '' 
I 'll bet a thousand ducats Ponder wants to help us out , but , between you and me , his didactics would be a millstone around our necks . 
I 'll manage him . 
His own specialty of musical and dramatic criticism was an understood matter ; Mears was to undertake the art notices -LRB- `` he paints badly , and therefore he is tolerably sure to write well , '' Brandagee whispered to me -RRB- ; the Avengerreporter was selected to prepare the city gossip , while to the clerk and myself was allotted the writing of short , lively stories or sketches of character for the first page . 
I was leaning on the narrow end of the grand piano , listlessly watching them as they moved through the figures of a quadrille , when Mrs. Deering suddenly addressed me with , -- `` Do n't you dance , Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
Somebody says , if one would stop his ears and shut out the music , one would find the movements of the dancers simply ridiculous . 
`` Mr. Godfrey wishes for the pleasure , '' -- Mrs. Deering began to say , by way of presentation and request . 
`` Now , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
He 's as false and heartless as he can be , Mrs. Deering ! '' 
`` Confess to me , now , Mr. Godfrey , '' said Miss Levi , when our turn came to rest , `` that you are as false in literature as you are in love . 
`` But there are some exceptions , and , with yourgenius , you might be one of them , Mr. Godfrey . '' 
`` Then I must go , John . '' 
An imp of mischief prompted me to say to Mrs. Deering , `` Introduce him to Miss Levi . 
`` Pray give yourself no uneasiness , Mr. Godfrey . 
Before we were summoned to the tea-table , Mrs. Deering found an opportunity to whisper to me , -- `` Make yourself quite easy , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` Ah , Mr. Godfrey , how do you do ? 
`` I shall always be glad to see you , Mr. Godfrey . '' 
`` And mine is John Godfrey . '' 
`` Indade , and it 's little I can do , '' she said , `` but you 're welcome to that little , Miss , even without Mr. Godfrey 's askin ' . 
And to think that you met him in the street , too , jist as I did ! 
It 's a mercy it was him , instid o ' the other young fellows that goes ragin ' around o ' nights . '' 
`` He has but a minute more , poor fellow ! '' 
`` I only heard of your arrival this evening , from Mrs. Deering , and hoped that I would be the first to compliment you on your daring ; but Mr. Godfrey , I see , has deprived me of that pleasure . '' 
Presently , however , he took hold of my arm with a fierce grasp , and exclaimed , -- `` John , did youmention it to her ? 
That girl is a trump , John Godfrey . 
`` John , '' said Penrose , `` come into the square . 
`` John Godfrey , '' he said at last , in a low voice , which , by its forced steadiness , expressed the very agitation it should have concealed , -- `` John Godfrey , there is no use in trying to disguise the truth from each other . 
`` Cousin John , '' cried Penrose , suddenly , seizing me by the hand , `` I know the world better than you do . 
Give up the rivalry , John ; it is not life or death with you ; you have friends ; you will have fame ; yours is a nature to form new ties easily ; you will find sunshine somewhere else without trying to rob me of mine ! '' 
Give me your hand , John , -- it may be we shall never shake hands again . '' 
`` And it 's a long time ye take , before you show y' rself , Mr. Godfrey , '' exclaimed Mary Maloney . 
Her face was covered by a thick veil , and I did not recognize her , but she stopped and said , hesitatingly , `` Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
I opened it ; there were only two lines , -- `` Miss Haworth informs Mr. Godfrey that her acquaintance with him has ceased . '' 
Will you drop it in the business office , to be sent up to him ? '' 
`` I met him yesterday at the corner of the Bible House , '' said Smithers , `` and I believe the fellow would have cut my acquaintance if he had dared . 
`` I am sorry to notice your remissness , Mr. Godfrey , '' said the chief , with a grave air , `` and I have only postponed speaking of it , because I hoped you would have seen and corrected it yourself . 
`` It is not that alone , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` Sure , and it is n't that , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` I 'm a widow , Mr. Godfrey , '' she said , `` and , askin ' y' r pardon , sir , nigh old enough to be the mother o ' you . 
There 's been somethin' I 've been a-wantin ' to say to you , but it is n't a thing that 's aisy said ; -- howsiver , I 've spoke to the praste about it , and he says as you 're a proper young man and my intentions is right , it 's no sin , naither shame , but rather a bounden juty , sir , -- and I hope you 'll take it so . 
`` Oh , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
`` Mr. Godfrey , '' she said at last , in a low , fluttering voice , `` you are not saying what you really think ? '' 
`` Do n't say anything more , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
Oh , Mr. Godfrey , do n't say that it 's myfault , -- that helping me has put such things into your head ; please , do n't say that ! 
She carried a thin package in her hand , and said , as she laid it on the table , -- `` I 've brought a Christmas for you to-day , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` Why , John -- John Godfrey , is it you ? '' 
`` Where do you live , John ? '' 
It 's a long time , John , since you and me slept together at th ' old farm . 
`` Never mind , John , '' he said . 
`` I would n't ha ' left you , at all , John , but for the work dependin ' on me ; it 's that big buildin ' down in Cortlandt Street , right-hand side . 
I no more expected to come across you , John , than -- than Adam . 
You wo n't want to go out , John , and I 'll keep you company . '' 
The fact is , John , we 've each one of us got to take our share of the hard knocks . 
`` You must have been feeding on husks with a vengeance , in that case , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` I thought you might want it , John , so I jest come up by way o ' Bleecker Street , and fetched it along , '' said he . 
`` Now we 'll take a fresh start , John , -- your head aginst my hands . 
`` John , '' he began again , `` there 's somethin' queer about this matter o ' love . 
I tell you , John , many 's the night I 've walked the streets , lookin ' into the girls ' faces , in mortal fear o ' seein ' hers among 'em . 
`` Where is she , John ? 
What ought to be done is past my knowledge , savin ' this one thing , that she must be found , -- must be , I say , and you 'll help me , John ? '' 
Mary confessed that she had not pressed her to repeat her visit soon ; `` you know the raison , Mr. Godfrey , '' she remarked . 
`` Cousin John , '' he said , and there was a tone in his voice which forced me to stand still and listen , though I could not take his offered hand , `` where have you been ? 
You were right , John ; I didleave her out of the account , in my calculations . 
His eyes read mine , and his lip trembled as he spoke , -- `` God bless you , John ! 
Try to think kindly of me , John , though you may not like the selfish and arbitrary streak I have inherited from my father ; let the natures of our mothers , only , speak to each other in us ! '' 
She grasped my hand in hers , crying , through her starting tears , -- `` Thank you , Mr. Godfrey ! 
When I left Mrs. Deering at her door , she said to me , -- `` I must ask your forgiveness , Mr. Godfrey : I fear I have done you injustice in my thoughts . 
Leave me now , if you please ; but I shall expect to see you every day while -- he lives . '' 
`` He 's an angel a ` ready , '' Bob said , and so we all felt . 
I opened it carelessly and read : -- `` I have judged you unjustly , and treated you rudely , Mr. Godfrey . 
`` Wait , if you please , Mr. Godfrey , '' she said . 
Be candid , Mr. Godfrey , and confess that the unexplained wrong would rest uneasily in your memory . '' 
I could not reconcile his assertion with the impression of your character which I had derived from my previous acquaintance with you ; but , as I said before , Mr. Godfrey , I had had unpleasant experiences of human selfishness and hypocrisy , -- my situation , indeed , seemed to expose me to such experiences , -- and I became doubtful of my own judgment . 
I passed Washington Square one evening , Mr. Godfrey , when you were there to hear the story of an unfortunate girl . 
Then she said , -- `` Is it not enough , Mr. Godfrey , that I have met her ? 
It was because I loved you , then , John , that I felt outraged and humiliated -- that I resolved never to see you again . 
You , of all the young men I knew , seemed to me earnest and sincere ; I trusted in you , from the start , and just as I began to hope -- as youhoped , John -- came this blow to both of us . 
`` I expected nothing less from you , John , '' she said . 
Then , I was afraid , Mr. Godfrey , that you might slip away before I could tell you that I know the cause of Isabel 's misunderstanding , and thank you , as a woman , for what you did . 
Only , not tonight , John , pray ; to-morrow , -- you will come again tomorrow ? '' 
Now , good-night , Mr. Godfrey , -- good-night , and God bless you ! '' 
You were a true friend to him , John ; how I have wronged you ! '' 
I looked at it , and read , with indescribable astonishment , the words , -- `` Miss Haworth informs Mr. Godfrey that her acquaintance with him has ceased . '' 
John ! 
`` John , have you found her ? '' 
`` You 're a good friend , John , '' he said . 
But then , John , there 's the disgrace . 
But it is n't the men , after all , John ; it 's the women that tear each other to pieces without mercy ! '' 
`` Mr. Godfrey . '' 
Isabel turned pale with the shock of the unexpected name ; but the next instant a resentful , suspicious feeling shot through her heart , and she asked , with a cold , stern face , -- `` Did he send you to me ? '' 
Jane cried , in distress , the tears coming into her eyes ; `` he do n't know where I am . 
I went away because the people talked , and the more he helped me the more his name was disgraced on account of it . 
`` How did you learn that I once knew Mr. Godfrey ? '' 
`` Not him , miss , oh , not him ! 
I found it out without his knowledge . 
When I saw that he was n't his right self , -- he was desperate , and said that he was parted from one he loved , and through no fault of his , and he did n't care what would become of him , -- and then when I found this , '' -- here she produced the note , -- `` and saw your name , I guessed you were the one . 
And then I made up my mind to come to you and clear him from the wicked reports , -- for indeed , miss , they 're not true ! '' 
`` I am Jane Berry , the girl he saved the night of the fire . '' 
`` Were you with him one evening in Washington Square ? '' 
`` That was the time I told him all about myself , and how I came to be where I was . 
I promise you that I will make atonement to Mr. Godfrey for my injustice . 
I will take Mr. Godfrey 's place : it belongs to a woman . '' 
`` Oh , is it so , Mr. Godfrey ? 
Do n't think me hard , Mr. Godfrey , or ungrateful for his remembrance of me when I 've no right to it ; but , indeed , I dare n't meet him now . 
Tell him I thank him from my heart , and will pray for him on my knees every night . 
Tell him I know now , when it 's too late , how good and true he is , and I 'll give back his love for me in the only way I dare , -- by saving him from his own generous heart ! '' 
Between you and me , John , if she 'd ha ' been over-anxious to see me , ' t would n't ha ' been a good sign , and I might ha ' drawed back . 
Taking your misgivings , John , and the eagerness of certain others , one would suppose it to be a question of millions . 
`` You must hear the fact , John . 
The postmark was Reading , and I thought I recognized my uncle 's cramped , heavy hand in the configuration of the words , -- `` Mr. John Godfrey . '' 
`` I wish he had ! '' 
`` Why , Mr. Godfrey ! '' 
`` That 's right , John ! 
Then Isabel quietly said , -- `` I shall be married to Mr. Godfrey in two months , and will not dispossess Mr. Tracy Floyd for so short a time . '' 
Some weeks afterwards , I received , one morning , the following letter from San Francisco : -- `` My Dear John , -- I know why you have not written to me . 
She tried to call me `` Mr. Godfrey , '' but the familiar `` Johnny '' wouldcome into her mouth , confusing her and bringing the unwonted color into her good old face , until she hit upon the satisfactory expedient of addressing me as `` Sir . '' 
`` I have been feeling the same thing all along , John , '' says she , `` and only waited for you to speak of it .
