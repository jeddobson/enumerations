`` They call him Wiry Willy ; and many suppose him half-witted . 
The gentlemen , however , had hardly been seated , before Alice was called for by Wiry Willy , and departed for the Presidential Mansion . 
`` Wiry Willy , '' was the response . 
`` And pray who is Wiry Willy ? 
`` Willy 's a friend -- Willy 's everybody 's friend . 
Why , General , Willy was only going out yonder on the grass to get you a horse . 
`` Mary Penford , '' said Wiry Willy , turning towards the ex-member , `` is old John Penford 's grand-daughter . 
Secure him for me , Willy . '' 
Wiry Willy vanished instantly , and in a few brief moments returned , leading the horse . 
`` General , '' said he , `` may I have leave of absence till I can find you a saddle and bridle ? '' 
`` Yes , Willy . '' 
Then turning and addressing the gentlemen nearest him , the leader said : `` President Randolph possesses the greatest mind and the bravest heart in America . 
He was born on Southern soil , and when the Federal Chair is engulfed in destruction , he will join us , and be our commander-in-chief . 
As for Wiry Willy , instead of approaching any of the country houses to obtain a bridle and saddle for the General , he glided through the bushes in the vicinity , until his ear was saluted by a low whinny , and turning to the left , he placed his hand on a black pony , which he mounted . 
A moment , gentlemen , '' he added , stepping aside , on beholding Wiry Willy standing a few paces apart . 
Glancing over the few lines handed him by Wiry Willy , his eagle eye sparkled with animation , and a joyous smile , for an instant , illuminated his expressive features . 
`` Breathe it to no one , sir , '' said he , in a whisper . 
There ! '' 
he continued , writing two words with his pencil on Willy 's scrap of paper , `` take this to General Valiant , and then go to bed . '' 
`` My friends , '' he continued , resuming his position , `` I have , I believe , communicated everything I had intended to say . 
But we can testify that the heart of Willy palpitated most violently when he beheld the mistress of that paradise in the little front area , watering the flowers , for she had already discovered that no dew that night had fallen from heaven . 
`` Mary , '' said Wiry Willy , throwing the reins over a post at the gate , `` I have not come to annoy you with the old story . 
But enter , Willy . 
Grandpa told me not to disturb him until breakfast was served . 
And , Willy , I said the old story was not annoying to me -- but to him . 
I have promised obedience , as was my duty , and -- must perform it -- while he lives . 
And when he is gone , I shall have no one on earth to -- '' `` Mary , I am yours till death . 
His jewels and fine coaches and mansions , would have no attractions for me , equal to the humble dwelling of my grandpa -- or -- I will say it , Willy -- the plain farm-house of your grandma , near the Brandywine . '' 
`` But , Willy , '' she asked , placing her little hand on his arm , `` what is this about life and death ? '' 
Your mother and I were second cousins -- '' `` My grandmother , you mean , '' said Willy . 
`` That is a verity , William , '' said the old man , rubbing his hands with delight . 
`` My dear , sir , '' said Willy , looking up , his head having fallen on his breast , `` this is no time for such speculations . 
And Willy , seeing Mary again among the flowers , rejoined her there . 
`` Farewell , Mary , '' said he , sadly . 
`` Oh , Willy , they would not injure him ! '' 
I will dissuade him , Willy , if possible ; but if not , I will accompany him ! '' 
`` And , Willy , where shall such a place be found ! 
Willy mounted his pony , with moistened eyes , and sped away . 
He had scarcely passed the last house in the town before a clatter of hoofs attracted his attention . 
Lifting his eyes he beheld a horseman under whip and spur riding towards him . 
It was a young man he had seen more than once at the White House . 
`` Do n't shoot me , '' said Willy ; `` I 'm a friend . '' 
`` That will do , '' replied the young man , relinquishing the pistol and extending his hand . 
`` Farewell , sir , '' said Willy , `` and may God prosper the right ! '' 
And as Willy proceeded on his way , he observed , on the opposite side of the river , a body of infantry , perhaps one hundred and fifty in number , slowly approaching the southern end of the bridge . 
It was during this pursuit Wiry Willy was despatched with a message to General Valiant , who remained in the city , and was to dine by invitation , with the President ; so confidently and correctly had the result been calculated . 
Wiry Willy dashed into the Avenue , at its extremity near the foot of Capitol Hill , and glided along with wonderful swiftness on his black pony , whilst his long white skirts streamed out behind on the wind . 
And now , for the first time , he beheld the scene of death wrought by the President 's cannon . 
Willy , on reaching the White House , delayed not a moment in delivering his note , for the doorkeeper had orders to admit him at all times . 
`` The day 's work is finished , Willy , and I desire to make known your meritorious conduct to this company . 
I was completely surrounded , and somewhat pressed , for a moment , by three or four of the enemy , when Willy cried out , ` Here 's the President ! ' 
Alice cast a grateful look at Willy 's modest face , and pointed to a chair beside her own . 
But Willy begged to be excused , and was permitted to retire . 
He hastened away towards the War Department ; and his heart palpitated painfully when , on casting his eyes in the direction of old John Penford 's office , he beheld the condition of the window . 
`` A cannon ball , '' said Wiry Willy , who stepped forward for the purpose of assisting him to rise . 
`` Perhaps , sir , '' said Willy , `` they may be found uninjured . '' 
`` Very freely , sir , '' said Willy ; `` if necessary I will testify on oath to it . 
But if you had taken my advice this morning -- '' `` Reproach him not , Willy ! '' 
said Mary , interposing ; `` the past can not be recalled , and sufficient for the present is his misery . '' 
`` Pardon , Mary , '' said Willy , rebuked ; `` and believe me that rather than inflict an additional pang , I would cheerfully , if possible , bear all his sufferings . '' 
said Mary , endeavoring to divert him from the grievous contemplation , `` let us leave this place . '' 
Not replying to the request , the poor girl took his hand , and gently led him away from the scene of his sorrow . 
`` True , child , '' said he , with unwonted animation . 
`` He meant my grandmother 's , '' said Willy , delighted at the suggestion . 
gasped Willy , and his head sank dejectedly on his breast . 
`` It is cool impudence , sir , '' said Willy . 
`` Do not fret him , Willy , '' whispered Mary . 
said Willy . 
`` And I hardly know what I should do without my Mary , '' said he . 
`` Then , '' said Willy , `` I propose that you both accompany me . '' 
said Willy , in a low tone , which , however , reached the ear of Mary ; but she made no remark upon it . 
She merely exerted her ingenuity to convince her aged relative that it would be utterly impossible for him to dwell in Georgetown without his granddaughter , and succeeded . 
Willy accompanied them home , and , on the way thither , riveted the attention of the faithful old public servant by a recital of the thrilling incidents of the day . 
And during the brief hours before Willy bade them adieu that day , not knowing when , if ever , they would meet again , it was not strange that he should repeat his warning to Mary to beware of the insidious wiles of General Ruffleton . 
When Willy returned to the President 's mansion , he was met near the entrance by the Blounts , who had just taken leave of their friends within , and were on the eve of departure for the sunny South . 
`` Come here , Willy , '' said Henry ; `` I have heard your history , and shall remember your meritorious conduct to-day . 
asked Willy , somewhat haughtily . 
`` No , Willy . 
`` Sir , '' said Willy , `` if you should lead a Southern army against the President -- '' `` Think not of that , Willy , '' said Henry ; `` my object is to serve you , even if we should be enemies . 
`` Name it , '' said Willy . 
said Willy , clasping Henry 's extended hand . 
`` And you are Wiry Willy ! 
Yes , Willy , I will trust to your guidance , believing that heaven sent you hither as my deliverer . '' 
`` I will go with you , Willy , '' said she , taking his arm and leaning on it for support . 
Wiry Willy led the way across a meadow , and by a narrow path through a dense growth of sapling oaks ; and there they beheld the humble cottage by a winding brook . 
Lifting the latch , Willy conducted his charge into a capacious room , illuminated with a lamp on a plain table , and warmed by a bright blaze in the broad fire-place . 
`` Who is this , Willy ? '' 
`` I leave you , grandma , for a short time , '' said Willy ; `` I must saddle my pony , and -- '' `` And what , Willy ? 
`` Now I know Willy 's purpose without another word from him , '' said the grandame . 
`` He will leave us under the protection of Bruce , the faithful dog , and seek information regarding your parent . '' 
He makes John Penford believe so ; but Willy is convinced that he has no such intention . 
That thought has robbed him of sleep , and at times almost bereft him of reason . 
The neighbors call him a poor harmless demented young man . 
But he is not demented on any subject but the one . 
It is true that , living here on the line between the free and the slave states , Willy , being once a politician , takes sometimes one side and sometimes the other ; but in whatever he does , I can see a good motive , and both parties have become accustomed to his eccentricities , and permit him to pass and repass at pleasure . 
Oh , he can serve you better than any of the violent partisans . 
And he will do it . 
You may have the most perfect reliance on his honor and his judgment ! '' 
`` He came to me as if in answer to my prayer for aid ! '' 
But , as for Willy , although in politics , and in these civil strifes , there may be no seeming consistency in his words or acts -LRB- for he appears very willing that they should deem him but half-witted -RRB- , you will find all his promises and engagements in your behalf will be redeemed , if human wit and exertion , with approbation from above , can accomplish them . '' 
said Willy , throwing open the door , `` farewell grandma -- farewell , Miss Langdon . 
None will molest Wiry Willy ; and none durst disturb the last surviving matron of the Revolution , who dressed the wounds of both friends and enemies brought hither from Chadds ' Ford . 
I will leave the pony at the Black Bear , and return in the cars . '' 
`` He will do all he says , my child , '' said the grandame , proudly . 
`` And I see he has removed a load of anxiety from you . '' 
`` He has , indeed ! 
He can not fail to get some tidings of my father , for many in the city know him well , and his reputation for moderation in all things , together with his vote against the Declaratory Resolution , will surely shield him from harm in a Northern city . 
Oh , yes ; I shall slumber sweetly , dreaming all the time that Willy has returned with my father , or with good news of him . 
But he had not time to permit her to dress his wound . 
The British were in pursuit ; and so , drinking a cup of fresh milk , and taking a few biscuits in his pocket , the wounded General remounted his horse and sped away , until faint with the loss of blood , they placed him in a carriage . 
`` Wiry Willy , '' was the prompt reply , the pony halting suddenly . 
`` On yourside , I think , '' said Willy , perceiving himself surrounded by armed men rising up on all sides , and emboldened by the conviction flashing upon him that these were men in the service of the President , although not in martial uniform . 
said Willy , `` and I 'll convince you ; '' and drawing a paper from the lining of his boot-leg , placed it in the hands of the officer . 
asked Willy . 
And saying this , Willy urged his pony towards the city , the glare of whose burning dwellings was now plainly perceptible . 
At the Black Bear he was well known , and his panting pony was placed in safe hands . 
Willy , on foot , plunged into the first mob he could find , and this was in Chestnut street . 
screeched one just at Willy 's elbow . 
asked Willy , in a low , familiar voice , of the one who had named him . 
`` South , '' said Willy . 
said Willy . 
`` William Wire , '' said Willy , after some hesitation , and concluding that it might be policy to give his true name . 
Willy seized this opportunity to abandon his sergeant for the purpose of seeking Mr. Langdon . 
Directing his course towards the square in the rear of Independence Hall , always a common centre in times of commotion , his diligence was soon rewarded with a sight of the Honorable Senator 's cage , at the head of a long row of similar impromptu contrivances made of wood , in imitation of a menagerie . 
Willy recognised in the keeper of Mr. Langdon the same Jack Bim who had volunteered under General Crook to seize the Federal treasure , and he was not quite certain whether it would be prudent to make himself known to him . 
Willy had whispered to Mr. B -- that the Senator 's daughter was safe . 
asked Willy , turning and addressing Bim , when Mr. Langdon was led away . 
`` I understand , '' said Willy . 
Then giving way to an impulse which seemed irresistible , he continued : `` It 's a pity , Jack , that we brave fellows should fight and bleed , and get no pay . 
But Willy embraced the first opportunity of losing himself in the dense crowd . 
He was a fine-looking individual , of large dimensions , and upon inquiry , Willy learned he was the publisher of a Democratic journal which had always been very bitter in its strictures against the Abolitionists . 
It was now early dawn , and Willy , alarmed at the news of General Ruffleton 's presence in the vicinity of his mother 's cottage , hastened his preparations for departure . 
To obviate this difficulty , and to insure the meeting of the daughter with her father , it occurred to Willy that it would be proper for the former to assume some sort of disguise . 
Therefore , after taking some food at the Black Bear , he wandered up Market street , and entered the first clothing store he found open at that early hour . 
He then lost no time in haggling , but selected a suit of boy 's apparel , such as he supposed would suit the height and shape of Edith . 
Then , hastening away to the depôt , he was soon flying at railroad speed towards the Delaware line . 
At the station nearest his grandmother 's residence , and just when , having descended from the car , he was in the act of starting across the country , Willy heard his name uttered by some one at the inn . 
`` Willy , '' said the general , `` I am about to be at the head of a great army . 
`` She is not , sir , '' said Willy . 
But why not be frank with me ? '' 
he added , in a lower tone , for many of his staff were standing near . 
`` The old incumbrance must be put out of the way , '' he continued , aside , but Willy heard it . 
`` Well , sir , '' added the general , turning once more to Willy , `` see that you do not attempt to deceive me , or to thwart my plans . 
Willy did go . 
And when an orchard hid him from view he mended his pace , and never paused until he reached the door of his own domicil ; then he stopped on the outside to take breath and to compose his features , for the considerate young man did not desire to alarm the friend of Mary , or his good grandame , by any symptoms of peril or panic in his physiognomy . 
So , when Willy entered the cottage there was a pleasant smile on his lip , and this was instantly interpreted aright by Edith . 
`` He is safe , Willy ? '' 
`` Quite safe , '' said Willy . 
`` And I can see him -- go to him ? '' 
`` I hope so , '' said Willy , seriously ; `` but you will have to be very careful . '' 
He then detailed enough of that which he had seen and heard , to make both Edith and his grandmother fully comprehend the condition of affairs . 
`` He knows you are safe , '' said Willy , `` if Mr. B -- told him what I whispered in his ear . '' 
`` I can not answer for Miss Edith 's safety here , '' said Willy . 
`` And why not , Willy ? '' 
Willy described what had passed in his interview with General Ruffleton , and Edith grew very pale . 
She knew Ruffleton quite well enough , and had once repulsed his marked advances as a lover . 
`` Yes , I must go , '' said she ; `` and the sooner the better . 
He is a bold bad man , and I shall not be happy until removed beyond the atmosphere in which he breathes . 
`` Willy will go with you , if you must leave our house , '' said the grandame . 
`` I will , with pleasure , '' responded Willy ; `` but the next train will not pass for some hours ; and I learn that the army under Ruffleton is collecting in great numbers on this side of the Schuylkill . 
`` I have provided this disguise , '' said Willy , exhibiting the apparel he had brought home in his handkerchief ; `` and I do sincerely believe it would be the most effectual that Miss Edith could adopt . '' 
`` And they are armed , '' said Willy , `` with swords and pistols , and -- '' `` What else ? '' 
Willy called back the dog , and stepped forward to meet the strangers , who had entered the gate . 
Without uttering any reply , Willy stepped back and presented them a pitcher and glasses . 
said Willy , re-entering and addressing Edith , `` let us depart as soon as possible . 
Edith snatched up the male attire , and hastened into the chamber where she had slept the preceding night , and hastily donned the clothes , which , thanks to Willy 's judgment , were of the proper dimensions . 
She had worn her heavy travelling shoes on the journey , and these being the only essential articles that Willy had omitted , she now felt convinced that her sex was in no danger of discovery . 
`` Yes , grandma , '' said Willy , `` it will serve as a protection to you , and may also shield me from harm . '' 
`` So , Willy , '' said he , averting his eyes , `` you have a great deal of running backwards and forwards to do ? '' 
`` I forgot my grandma 's coffee , '' said Willy . 
and glancing once more at Edith , he withdrew his head . 
`` Willy , '' said Edith , after sitting some time in silence , `` that man doubted your story . 
`` Do not fear for me , '' said Willy . 
said Willy , `` and there may be some danger going the usual way in the omnibus . '' 
`` We could go a circuitous route , '' said he , and then , after a little hesitation , and addressing Willy , he continued : `` You were kind enough to give me a glass of delicious water this morning . 
Willy thanked him , but remarked that he was well acquainted with the streets himself , neither declining nor accepting the tender . 
And when they arrived at the depôt the stranger hastened to employ a hackney coach , which drew up near the place where Willy and Edith were standing . 
Most fortunately Willy happened to be acquainted with the driver , and urging Edith to enter , and then whispering a word in the ear of his old acquaintance , sprang in himself and closed the door . 
Not really apprehending any danger from the cannon , which indeed had now ceased to be heard , Willy , with the concurrence of Edith , told the driver to go by the shortest way to the Black Bear , a place , as Willy observed , to which he would not have taken Edith in any other costume than that she was then in . 
It was deemed best for Willy to go forth alone , and endeavor to obtain tidings of Mr. Langdon . 
She therefore promised to await the report of Willy , and requested him not to precipitate his return on her account , unless , indeed , his inquiries were quickly crowned with success . 
Willy , therefore , after seeing that his pony had not been molested by any of the roving recruiting sergeants , set out alone . 
But he had not gone twenty paces before he observed with some concern that he was followed by the gentleman whom he had so unceremoniously abandoned at the depot ! 
At first he resolved to stride on very briskly , and thus shake off this persistent companionship . 
But finding his follower likewise quickened his steps , Willy slackened his pace , and resolutely awaited the result . 
uttered Willy , pausing abruptly . 
A glance sufficed to convince Willy that Mr. Langdon had been conveyed to some other place ; and then , striving to elude his unpleasant companion , he directed his steps towards the mansion of Mr. B -- . 
Willy , glancing back as he was hurried up the marble steps , beheld the stranger , who had followed him , smiling significantly , if not tauntingly ; and then poor Willy 's heart experienced a painful sensation . 
His captors , imposing silence with menacing gestures , led him up several winding stairways and turned him into an attic room . 
asked Willy , when the men were about to leave him . 
continued Willy . 
Jack Bim , in pursuance of the hint he had received from Wiry Willy , lost not a moment in organizing a select party for a demonstration on the Rev. Mr. Fire 's church . 
Severalhours had passed , and yet Wiry Willy had not returned . 
But her impatience for the return of Wiry Willy increased . 
Then approaching the host , she asked him if he was not Willy 'd friend . 
said he . 
WhenWiry Willy found himself alone in the attic , a prisoner , and thought of the painful anxiety of Edith for his return , her disappointment , and her probable fate , if she fell into the hands of the creatures of Ruffleton , a result to be anticipated , he became a victim of the most excruciating misery . 
His first impulse was to burst open the door , when he reflected that every passage was strictly guarded . 
His next was to throw up the window opening on the roof ; but his escape by day seemed impossible . 
He threw himself on a bed in the corner of the room to rally his energies and concentrate his wits for the emergency . 
He remained perfectly motionless for many minutes , when he remembered what Edith had done in her extremity . 
Springing from the bed he fell down on his knees , and uttered a long and fervent prayer for the intervention of Divine assistance in behalf of Edith -- the Edith who had already been once delivered by Providence . 
When Willy arose his eyes rested on the partly opened door of a closet beside the window . 
He gazed steadfastly , for he thought he had seen it move on its hinges ; he recollected that he had once essayed unsuccessfully to open it . 
He strode forward , and thrusting it wide open , beheld a man seated on the floor within , presenting a pistol at his breast . 
It 's Wiry Willy ! '' 
exclaimed Willy . 
asked Willy , forgetful of his advice . 
said Willy . 
I 'll get you off from here , Willy , when it 's a little darker . '' 
`` Willy , all you have to do is to say South , and they 'll let you pass . '' 
and with his bowie knife Jack removed the lock in a few minutes . 
said Willy . 
Wiry Willy , where were you ? '' 
I 've been reading , Wiry Willy , and I 've seen some service , too . 
Do you stay here , Willy , and watch the money , till I can snatch a loaf and a bottle ; and when I come back you can go . '' 
Willy told him everything connected with the misfortunes of Edith . 
`` I am with you , Willy ! '' 
But when they were passing through the hall , Willy 's blood ran cold on recognising the angry voice of General Ruffleton in the parlor , and before the open door of which it was necessary to pass in order to reach the street . 
Willy held his breath and paused . 
Willy passed the parlor door , gave the word to the sentry in the vestibule , and descended to the street . 
Having entered the western gate , and proceeded a few steps , Willy paused and listened an instant to the one who then addressed the people . 
`` That 's Senator Langdon , '' said he . 
said Willy , `` it is Edith ! '' 
`` Then we 'll have her , Willy , '' said Bim : `` but that 's Major Trapp ! 
He 's my superior officer , and I do n't want him to recognise me , unless it 's to be my luck to kill him ! '' 
`` And Jack , '' said Willy , `` I wanthim to recognise me . 
And Willy approached the tree where the Major was striving to pacify the now recovered Edith . 
`` Oh , Willy ! '' 
and she held out her hands towards him . 
said Willy , springing forward . 
said the Major , presenting a pistol . 
He fired , and Willy fell . 
cried Bim , springing forward , with his bowie-knife . 
But even before Edith had reached her chamber , she had related the manner of her deliverance , and almost frantically insisted that poor Willy , stunned , not fatally wounded , whose fall she had witnessed , should be removed from the Square , and taken to his aged grandmother . 
It was Wiry Willy , recovered from his wound . 
`` Willy ! '' 
exclaimed Alice , running to the faithful messenger and receiving a letter from his hand . 
Now , Willy , I see important news in your face . 
`` No , sir . 
`` He has crossed the Susquehanna , sir . '' 
But he will find the Caudine forks between the Chesapeake and the Potomac ! '' 
`` He intends to enter Virginia , sir , by crossing the Long Bridge . '' 
Go to Mary Penford , Willy , she is in distress . 
Willy 's eyes were dilated with surprise , but he did not pause for further information . 
said Alice , after Willy had departed ; `` I fear it is over with him . 
Wiry Willy hastened away at that late hour to Georgetown . 
He bore the infatuated old clerk a letter from General Ruffleton , who , believing Willy little better than a mere simpleton , had not destroyed him . 
Perceiving lights in several of the rooms , Willy knew that Mary was watching , and that he could obtain admittance . 
The servant girl who answered the bell , conducted him into the little parlor , where he beheld Mary , pale , and with traces of recent tears on her lovely face . 
She was sitting beside the physician , but immediately arose , and taking the hand of Willy , conducted him in silence to a chair . 
`` Willy , '' said Mary , `` my poor grandpa is about to leave me . '' 
`` That is true , Willy . 
I do not think it was ever his design to inflict injury on any human being . 
And he is now about to be at rest . '' 
Oh , Willy -- that dreadful day ! 
But come with me -- he will know you . 
He is more rational as he approaches his end . '' 
`` I have a letter for him , Mary -- shall I deliver it ? '' 
Oh , Willy , I fear him more than ever , since his abominable conduct to Edith ! 
She has written me all -- and warned me against his machinations . 
He recognised Willy . 
`` William Wire , '' said he , `` what news do you bring of General Ruffleton ? '' 
Willy presented the letter . 
He caught her hand and kissed it , and then placed it tenderly in Willy 's . 
said he , `` she is thine . 
said the weeping Mary , who , with the rest , observed the fearful change rapidly spreading over his features , `` to-morrow you may be called into the presence of your heavenly father ! '' 
`` God is my judge and my savior , '' said he . 
`` He says the end is near , '' said Willy ; for Mary was incapable of utterance . 
Pale , though composed , Mary sat at one end of the breakfast table , and Willy occupied the other . 
said Willy . 
`` And when will battles end , Willy ? '' 
To the utter consternation of both Mary and Willy , the door was thrown violently open , and several armed men rushed in . 
`` There she is , '' said the leader , who was instantly recognised by Willy as one of the aides of Ruffleton , Major Snare . 
said Willy , approaching the officer . 
You can remain , Willy . '' 
She then requested to see Wiry Willy -- but he could nowhere be found . 
It is Wiry Willy ! '' 
Willy emerged in view , urging his pony to the top of his speed , while his long coat floated out on the breeze . 
`` What news now , Willy ? '' 
Willy , with mingled pain and consternation , by speech and gesture succeeded in making known the catastrophe which had befallen Mary . 
Willy will show you the way to intercept Major Snare . 
Do not kill him ; merely ensnarehim . 
Wiry Willy indicated the road by which Major Snare would be likely to attempt to form a junction with the main body of Ruffleton 's army , then in full retreat , with Crook thundering in the rear . 
The rest followed , of course , excepting poor Wiry Willy , whose pony fell short of the opposite side , and rolled down to the bottom , landing , however , without injury to horse or rider , in a bed of leaves . 
But where is Willy ? '' 
`` Willy ! 
WhenWiry Willy and his pony fell into the chasm , they were so completely buried in the leaves which had been wafted thither by the winds of autumn , that neither were perceived by the hundred horsemen who passed over their prostrate bodies . 
And when Willy , extricating himself from his pony , endeavored to rise on his feet , he was clasped in the arms of a powerful man , and all attempts at resistance were utterly vain . 
`` I 've got him , Sergeant , '' said the gigantic man who had seized Willy . 
`` I make no resistance , gentlemen , '' said Wiry Willy , `` because I feel you have me in your power . 
said Willy in amazement . 
demanded Willy . 
`` I 'm a private in General Ruffleton 's army , '' said Willy . 
cried Captain Bim , `` it isWiry Willy ! '' 
and he turned Willy around and embraced him . 
`` I 'll arrange it , '' said Willy . 
`` I 'll take a few pieces , Willy -- but not all . 
They succeeded , after some labor , in extricating the pony , and then Willy directed his steps towards the eminence lately in possession of the President and his fine cavalry . 
`` But , Willy , would n't General Crook take me into his service ? '' 
`` General Crook will not enlist Northern men , '' said Willy . 
`` Never fear , '' said Willy . 
And you , Willy , who have been on all sides , have fought on none . '' 
`` The Bible says thou shalt not kill , '' said Willy . 
Willy acknowledged there was . 
`` They have been taken to the other side of the Potomac , '' said Willy . 
`` He said I might get rich catching niggers , and that they were as plenty as crows in Jersey , and every one I caught would sell for a thousand dollars . '' 
Willy easily made him comprehend everything . 
`` Wiry Willy , '' said Bim , casting a ferocious glance at the one addressed , `` you have deceived me . 
`` By George , Willy ! '' 
The only guards in the immediate vicinity were the troop of Blue Caps , and among these fighting Jack Bim had been incorporated by the President , at the desire of Alice , upon learning from Wiry Willy the generous conduct of the Captain in Philadelphia . 
Here is Wiry Willy . '' 
`` And Edith , Willy ! '' 
`` This letter , sir , to Miss Alice , will probably explain everything , '' said Willy , delivering the letter . 
`` There seems to have been a mistake , Willy , '' said Alice , `` and it is fitting that you should know it . 
Willy , see who has just arrived . '' 
She laments that he has not responded to any of her recent letters -- '' `` Ha ! 
Willy , who is it ? '' 
he asked , seeing his faithful messenger at the door , awaiting permission to announce some one . 
`` Commodore Stout and Captain Early , with some prisoners , '' said Willy . 
said Wiry Willy , who sat in the piazza . 
`` There are three horses , '' said Willy . 
`` Admit him , Willy , '' said Alice , adjusting the ample folds of satin at her feet . 
Willy walked out upon the lawn . 
Willy met him , and was recognised . 
Blount , with a pale , and almost haggard countenance , received his proffered hand in silence , and they proceeded several paces together before a word was uttered . 
`` Willy , '' at length said the lofty son of the South , `` your pledge was nobly fulfilled . 
`` I was in the city to-day , sir , '' said Willy . 
`` Enough , Willy , '' said Blount , striding on alone . 
When he ascended the steps of the piazza , his glance caught the glitter of a diamond on the alabaster forehead of Alice . 
She arose and offered her hand , which was almost cold to his touch . 
Here the President was interrupted by the unceremonious entrance of Wiry Willy . 
`` Not less than eight hundred , sir , '' answered Willy . 
`` We shall ensnare this Major , '' said the President , Willy having added that the leader of the party was the same Major Snare who had abducted Mary Penford . 
He then wrote a few words to General Valiant , and despatched them by Willy , who proceeded thither under cover of the hedges . 
`` We must surrender , General , '' he added , smiling , `` and you may be marble , Alice , in perfect safety . 
`` Ah , Willy , '' said Alice , seeing the faithful messenger of her father approaching on his pony , `` I hope this Northern General has ceased to mar your happiness . '' 
`` That may be , Willy -- but I shall not be uneasy or annoyed . 
He can grieve no one by his flatteries to me , Willy , and I shall know their value . '' 
Itwas just as the first streaks of morning appeared in the East that Wiry Willy rode along the highway near the Delaware river . 
The place was at no great distance from New Castle , and his destination seemed a few miles below the encampment of General Crook , where the naval officers , who were with the President the preceding evening , had been landed . 
Willy , supposing he had passed the last sentinels in that direction , which he desired to avoid merely because he might be temporarily detained by them , and not that he apprehended serious molestation from the Southerners , began to whistle a lively tune , for his affairs seemed in a prosperous condition . 
Mary was at his grandame 's , and he had seen her the day before , on his return from Philadelphia ; and , if nothing untoward occurred to disappoint his expectation , he would be likely to see her again the day following . 
But just when Willy was passing a dilapidated barn on the wayside , four men , armed with muskets , rushed out and seized his pony , which strove in vain to elude their grasp by dint of kicking and biting . 
`` Willy has n't time , '' said Willy . 
`` Willy ! 
Wiry Willy ! 
And the soldiers led him in the direction of the Southern encampment . 
said Willy , `` I hope you will not detain me . 
`` Very well , '' rejoined Willy ; `` and is General Crook an enemy of the President ? 
But no sooner was Willy recognised by several of the subordinate officers , who recollected having seen him at Bladensburg , than they began to express sorrow for his fate . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said Willy , `` I can not see why you should be so very sorry for me , since I am sure General Crook will order my release immediately . '' 
said Willy . 
I fear you are a spy , Wiry Willy . 
`` That is true , sir ; I do not deny it , '' said Willy ; `` but did I not serve you afterwards , when the President was not your enemy ? '' 
Willy , you shall have a fair trial , but it must necessarily be a brief one . '' 
But if guilty , Willy , I can not save you . '' 
`` If I could see General Blount himself , '' said Willy , apprehensive of the effect of Carlisle 's testimony , `` I am sure he would acquit me . '' 
`` No , Willy ; he might pardon you , but how could he acquit you ? 
How could he know that you did not betray him ? 
No -- no ! 
He has released several under the death sentence already , who proved ungrateful afterwards , and wrought us injury ; and , when informed of the evil effects of his ill-judged clemency , he requested that no more such cases might be referred to him . 
A drum-head court-martial was summoned , before whom Carlisle testified , with great circumstantiality , to the guilt of Willy . 
It was in vain that the prisoner solemnly protested his innocence , and asserted that every material particle of the testimony was without foundation in truth . 
Poor Willy was condemned to die upon the gallows within the space of three hours ! 
`` General , '' said he , `` will you permit me to send a note to General Blount ? 
`` I can not , Willy . '' 
`` Impracticable . 
Willy selected the one most familiar with the country , by whom he sent a few lines , written with a pencil . 
In the meantime the gallows was erected , and every preparation made for the execution ; for no one supposed that such a paper as Willy had mentioned could be produced . 
`` Wiry Willy , '' said General Crook , `` you must deliver into my hands the despatches for Commodore Stout . '' 
`` Pardon me , General , '' said Wiry Willy . 
Search him , gentlemen , '' he continued , addressing those who attended him . 
`` Willy , '' said the general , `` I can not break my word by pardoning you . 
`` General , '' said Willy , his eyes steadily fixed on the floor , `` I have neither destroyed any despatch , nor thrown it away since my arrest . 
Saying this , the General shook Willy 's hand , and mounting his horse , rode away after the troops , all of whom , with the exception of a small party , were now marching towards the main body of the army in the immediate vicinity of New Castle . 
`` There are no signs of salvation , Willy , '' said the Sergeant , `` and only five minutes remain . 
asked Willy , casting down his eyes on the watch in the Sergeant 's hand . 
You must forgive me , Willy . '' 
Remember , Willy , that although I may delay the execution a few minutes , there is no probability that you will escape the death penalty . 
Learn , Willy , that the messenger was intercepted on the way and captured by some of General Ruffleton 's men . 
`` Your reluctance to take my life , Sergeant , and pity for my condition , '' said Willy , `` is some alleviation . 
As the Sergeant said this he held the watch before Willy 's face . 
`` A few minutes more , Sergeant , '' said Willy . 
`` Five more , Willy ; but hope not . '' 
Why , it 's Wiry Willy ! '' 
cried the midshipman , recognising Willy . 
`` Sergeant ! '' 
Throw off that tackle , Willy , '' he said , turning to the prisoner . 
But Willy 's hands were tied , and the Commodore dashed off the halter himself , and then cut the cord that bound his hands . 
`` Pardon me , Commodore , '' said Willy ; `` but the Sergeant and his men saw the search ordered by General Crook -- '' `` They searched you , and found it ? '' 
`` Now , sir , '' said the Commodore , when Willy was conducted into the cabin , `` let me see how you contrived to p619-151 conceal the despatch , so that the land-lubbers could n't find it . '' 
Willy ran his fingers through his hair , and touching some hidden springs , removed the scalp from his crown . 
`` But how the -- could one so young have -- '' `` I had it shaved off , sir , by a barber , '' said Willy , `` expressly for the purpose of carrying despatches . '' 
Up anchor ! '' 
Among these , the gallant old Commodore was by no means the least conspicuous ; and he was followed by Wiry Willy , who had just landed from the frigate , under the protection of whose guns the President 's army was crossing over to Camden . 
As soon as the young ladies perceived Willy , they distinguished him above all others by the cordiality of their reception . 
`` That is a heartier welcome , '' said the old Commodore , `` than any of us old salts could look for ; or than any one could expect after having seen the predicament in which I found Willy this morning . '' 
And Willy shrank back on turning his head and recognising General Ruffleton . 
His purpose was , instinctively , to avoid him ; but it was too late . 
`` Willy , '' said the General , a mocking smile playing on his broad features , `` you told me the truth . 
Never conceal anything from me again , Willy . 
How do you knowthat , Willy ? '' 
Never attempt to deceive me , Willy , and you may have your Mary . '' 
muttered Wiry Willy , who overheard the familiar term . 
`` Come here , Willy ! '' 
Say that he meditates an attack -- '' `` Pray , go on , Miss Edith , '' said Willy . 
`` Not clearly , '' said he , for he did not hear the words which had alarmed Edith . 
continued Alice , when Willy had departed . 
said Willy . 
`` It 's no rumor , Wiry Willy , '' said the Sergeant , throwing an arm round his friend 's neck , for he was in excellent humor , having repeatedly drunk the President 's health after saving his life . 
He detailed the particulars of the occurrence in the greedy ears of Willy . 
`` Now , Willy , '' he continued , `` can you spare another half-eagle or so ? '' 
Manage things , Willy , so I shall never be obliged to fight against him . 
I like his eagle eye . 
And , besides , you know , I cracked some skulls in defending him . 
Sergeant Bim plunged into one of those gambling establishments where so much of his money had gravitated ; and in less than fifteen minutes all that he had obtained from Wiry Willy passed the same inexorable bourn . 
The bed , the fractured chairs , and the old table , appeared to have been unmolested since he and Wiry Willy abandoned the premises . 
Wiry Willy related to me what Miss -- I mean the boy -- said had happened . 
Poor Willy may lose his life for the want of the paper ! '' 
Wiry Willy ? 
I did n't read his name . '' 
`` Then you need n't give yourself any more trouble about him . 
They hung him this morning as a spy . 
Willy escaped , and I saw him not two hours ago . 
`` Wiry Willy 's friend -- and no friend of General Ruffleton . '' 
But did not some one say poor Willy was dead ? '' 
Wiry Willy was in this city , alive and well , this very night . 
`` But poor Wiry Willy , when he finds out that they have taken her away from his grandmother 's , '' said Bim , `` will be perfectly miserable . '' 
Be there at the time I have indicated , and you will see Willy , to whom you can deliver your glad tidings . 
Thehour struck for Sergeant Bim to go on duty , and Wiry Willy , parting from his friend , was met by Mary in the passage between the President 's and Mr. Langdon 's suites of apartments . 
`` Willy , I 'm sorry to see you in my clutches again . 
`` General , I have this for you , '' said Willy , delivering a diminutive scrap of paper . 
Wiry Willy is not an enemy . 
Willy , '' he continued , shaking the hand of the faithful messenger , `` I 'm glad we did n't hang you ! '' 
`` So am I , General , '' said Willy , with a very serious countenance . 
Wiry Willy , '' he continued , `` can you tell me what Blount was doing ? '' 
`` Mount and ride with me , Willy ; I have more to say to you . 
`` He will not attack us . '' 
`` Neither did he attack Gen. Ruffleton . 
But his presence decided the battle . '' 
How now , Willy ? '' 
he continued , directing the attention of his company to Willy . 
`` They have defeated the resolutions , sir , '' whispered Willy . 
`` Willy , '' said the President , `` come to my closet for letters as soon as you are in readiness to start for the city . 
And about the same time Wiry Willy obtained admission , and placed a communication from President Randolph in the hand of the President of the Convention . 
But a moment after his composure was recovered , and despatching a brief note by Willy to Edith , his official demeanor was resumed with dignity . 
Calling the Convention to order , he stood up and read a brief narrative of the melancholy occurrence at Red Bank , as written by President Randolph , as well as the letter found in the hand of the dying General . 
`` Father , '' said Edith , for the three consisted of Langdon , his daughter , and Mary Penford , `` I fear they will not permit Willy to return . '' 
`` They might not , Edith , if they knew him ; but he will escape observation . '' 
`` I do not fear for Willy , '' said Mary , `` for his Maker , in whom we trust , will guard him . '' 
`` Willy ! '' 
asked Mr. Langdon , another flash of lightning showing the herculean form that accompanied Willy . 
`` It is Sergeant Bim , '' said Willy , `` as true a friend as ever lived . '' 
`` We thought we were watched and followed , '' said Willy ; `` and so we determined not to come down Chestnut street . 
`` They are assaulting the Federal troops at the Mint and Custom House , '' said Willy , in reply to an interrogatory of Mr. Langdon , upon hearing discharges of fire-arms . 
The party was soon bounding out from the shore , under the impulsion of the strong arms of Bim and Willy . 
And in such a moment Wiry Willy narrated the occurrences in the Convention , subsequently to the abandonment of the chair by Mr. Langdon . 
`` Do you not think , sir , '' asked Willy , addressing Mr. Langdon , `` that we had better row to the Jersey shore before the heavy rain comes on ? '' 
`` No , Willy , '' said he , `` we might fall into the hands of Ruffleton 's myrmidons , far more cruel than the raging elements ! '' 
`` We are approaching the landing , '' said Willy ; `` and I saw a boat push out from shore , rowed by sailors . 
`` Wiry Willy ? '' 
`` Did he not go with Mary Penford and the rest ? '' 
`` No , sir . 
He said you did not name him as one of the party . '' 
`` I did not ; but I thought he would go . 
Yes ; he will answer . '' 
`` I will have him sent immediately . '' 
`` Willy , '' said the President , when the faithful messenger appeared , `` can you go , without risk , into Ruffleton 's camp ? '' 
I have two objects , Willy . 
`` I will start immediately , sir , '' responded Willy , withdrawing . 
But here is Wiry Willy , returned already . 
`` No , sir , '' said Willy . 
Lose no time , Willy , in placing it in his hands , and he will not delay in coming to our aid . 
We must be prepared to fight like lions , '' he added , as Crook returned and Willy departed . 
General Ruffleton ` shead-quarters were not more than two miles distant from Randolph 's . 
The General-in-Chief was seated in a magnificent tent , comprising many apartments . 
General Blount , attended only by Wiry Willy , had left the camp as soon as the troops were steeped in slumber , and embarked on a small steamer of great swiftness . 
Upon dismounting , Willy , familiar with all the entrances , abandoned the General to the guidance of Alice , who received him on the vine-clad porch at the southern extremity of the house . 
Alice sped through the dimly lighted apartments , and Blount promenaded the veranda , where he was joined by Wiry Willy . 
`` Are you ready to return , Willy ? '' 
Mount , Willy -- I will overtake you . '' 
Willy had hardly passed out of view when Alice returned , agitated and almost breathless . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
Alice gazed after him , and never turned her straining eyes away until the last echoes of the hoofs of his steed died upon the ear . 
Willy had just arrived from the battle-field . 
said he , `` General Blount has not been wounded , and his health is perfect -- and his spirits good . '' 
`` I am rejoiced to hear of his health , Willy , '' said Edith ; `` and if his good spirits may be indicative of a speedy termination of this horrible strife , I shall be happy indeed . 
Willy , when the fratricidal strife is over , do thou never emerge from the peaceful vale where my daughter found a hospitable shelter , on the purling Brandywine ! '' 
`` No -- not that , '' said Mr. Langdon , `` after the confident letter he wrote me . '' 
`` Nor his fall -- nor the fall of any of the Generals , '' said Mary , `` if my prayers have been heard . '' 
`` They have recommenced the cannonade on the land , '' said Wiry Willy . 
`` The fire has ceased on both , '' said Willy , `` and I can see the small boats plying between them and the other ships . 
`` Run , Willy ! '' 
Alice drew the attention of Mary to the smooth-faced young man , the messenger from the Northern camp , sitting beside Willy . 
Several times he has paused in his conversation with Willy , and looked steadily at you . 
`` I am sure I can not be mistaken , '' said he ; `` for Wiry Willy has informed me of the incidents in the city , wherein you were an involuntary actor . 
`` Then , my Lord , Willy will wait on you and receive , and faithfully deliver , any letters you may prepare this night . 
His Lordship was wheeled back into the saloon and thence borne , without delay , to his own apartment , whither Wiry Willy was summoned to attend him at a late hour of the night . 
Wiry Willy , having changed his coat , which had become known in the several armies , set out from the President 's head-quarters , early in the morning , on his double mission . 
As he passed through Philadelphia , poor Willy beheld , with a sad heart , the evidences of desolation produced by civil war . 
Upon landing in Camden , Willy was under the necessity of exhibiting his passport ; and it was frequently inspected in the cars . 
Upon landing at the Battery in New York , the first spectacle which greeted the vision of Willy , was the glitter of innumerable bayonets . 
Willy , in obedience to the instructions of Randolph , proceeded first in quest of Mr. Lex , a gentleman of fortune , a patriot , but one of the friends of the President . 
At the stately mansion of Mr. Lex , Willy was confronted by a grey-haired negro porter . 
`` I desire to see Mr. Lex , '' said Willy . 
When it was announced that the messenger came from the President , he rose with alacrity , and taking Willy 's hand between his own , in silence , led him to a chair . 
Then turning his benevolent countenance full upon him , awaited the communication he had to deliver . 
Willy removed the scalp from his head and placed two documents in the hands of the patriot . 
Being deemed hazardous to send any of the printed copies by Willy , the President requested Mr. Lex to have a certain number printed in the city , and to furnish Willy with a list of names of faithful friends in the Northern States to whom they might be delivered . 
Mr. Lex placed a bank note in Willy 's hand . 
Wiry Willy , after leaving the mansion of Mr. Lex , proceeded to the City Hall , now jocularly called the Lion 's Den . 
As he was passing near the Park , Willy 's eyes were almost blinded by an object glittering in the sun ; and this , when he drew nearer , he discovered to be the polished blade of a guillotine just erected . 
Willy shivered with dread , and passed on through the Guards which surrounded the Hall . 
`` Willy ! '' 
`` Let the letters speak for themselves , if you wo n't believe Wiry Willy ! '' 
`` Willy ! '' 
Willy was afraid to refuse the gold ; but he declared that he demanded no additional recompense , except a passport to go wherever he pleased . 
`` Wiry Willy is not fool enough for that ! 
She 's a pretty girl , Willy -- but I have other matters to think about now . 
`` He 's a skilful penman , but an unfaithful clerk ! 
Tell Randolph not to trust him . 
Is he much in Randolph 's presence ? '' 
`` A great deal . 
`` He did the same for me , and then ran away the first chance he had . 
Wiry Willy is resolved to see Niagara , Saratoga , Newport , and Boston . 
But he saw one thing yonder in the Court-house yard such as he never laid eyes on before . 
If you linger in the Park an hour or so , Willy , you may see the operation , and then you can tell the people all about it in your travels . '' 
Your hand -- good-by , Willy . '' 
And Willy hastened away . 
Infront of the sombre prison-house Willy beheld a vast multitude of men , women , and children , impatiently awaiting the hour for the prisoners to be led forth to execution . 
Willy urged his way through the crowd . 
Presenting the card with the awful autograph of Ruffleton , iron gates and triple-nailed doors flew open before him . 
The Major was sitting at the extremity of the room , in deep abstraction , and did not observe the entrance of Willy . 
Willy proceeded to the corner where Major S -- remained , unmindful of everything said and done by his fellow-prisoners . 
`` Major , '' said Willy , placing his hand on the prisoner 's shoulder , and speaking in a low tone , `` do you not know me ? '' 
`` Wiry Willy ! '' 
Willy , repeat my words to President Randolph . '' 
`` I will faithfully , Major , '' said Willy . 
`` I have seen Mr. Lex , '' continued Willy , `` and he sent you this . '' 
`` Return it , Willy . 
I understand his meaning . 
Willy repaired to the Park , when the prisoners were taken thither , and , by exhibiting the signature of the dreaded General , was permitted to stand at the side of the Major , who promptly announced his readiness to submit to his fate . 
Willy , say to the President that I did not shrink from my fate ; and that I died believing my death would contribute , sooner or later , to rescue the country from the hands of the usurping despots and traitors . 
The Major , after giving his watch to Wiry Willy , and clasping his hand briefly while he whispered something in his ear , ascended the platform with a steady step . 
It was not necessary to pull him down forcibly . 
He adjusted himself in the necessary position , and the knife descended . 
His head fell into a basket , and his blood was absorbed by a profusion of sawdust . 
Willy , by the exhibition of the Protector 's signature -- and but few took the pains to read further -- had no difficulty in obtaining possession of the remains of the ill-fated Major . 
More than once , Willy , in passing that night the groups of armed men -- and but few others then ventured into the streets -- at the crossings , was compelled to show his passport . 
And in every instance the beholder started back in awe at the consciousness of the high authority under which the pedestrian moved . 
said Mr. Lex , after inviting Willy to be seated . 
`` No , sir , it was impossible , '' said Willy . 
Provided with the necessary instructions , Willy lost no time in setting out on his journey . 
In the cars , where there were always the secret spies of Ruffleton , Willy ceased to be the subject of suspicious scrutiny whenever he produced the awful signature of the Protector . 
But when he ceased to meet the military and other partisans of Ruffleton , in the less frequented lines of travel , the secret sign of the patriots availed him most . 
Nor was it long before he discovered to his great joy , that even in New England , a majority of the population had become inimical to the designs of those who now usurped the direction of public affairs in the North . 
Willy lingered several days in the city , for there were many patriots there who sighed for the restoration of the Union and re-establishment of the Federal authority . 
During the sojourn of Willy in Boston a Catholic bishop was condemned to die . 
When returning from the scene of his execution , Willy felt the weight of some one 's hand on his shoulder . 
Turning , he was thunderstruck on beholding the sharp and swarthy features of Phipps , one of the Three ! 
`` What are you doing here , young man ? '' 
`` I -- I am on business for the -- the -- '' He paused , having almost divulged the secret of his mission before recovering his wits . 
`` That 's Willy 's business -- and none of yours ! '' 
replied he , fortified with the recollection that he bore none of the circulars or other documents about his person . 
You are not bound to criminate yourself , '' Saying this Phipps strode on , while two of the secret officers of the Inquisition , who seemed to have been standing near in readiness , seized Willy and dragged him along , unmindful of his protestations of innocence , and of the assertion that he bore a passport from the Protector himself . 
Arriving before the Three , Willy gazed at the accuser and the judges with an indifferent calmness , which only seemed to increase their thirst for his blood . 
The prosecutor recapitulated all that Phipps had alleged ; and then Willy was called upon to answer the charges of identification with the slave-driving enemy , and of being a spy . 
Willy stood up , and very deliberately unfolding the passport , read it aloud to the court . 
`` Certainly , sir , '' said Willy , imitating the attorney 's politeness . 
The passport was returned to Willy . 
Its validity was not only acknowledged , but its bearer was invited to dinner ; an honor he declined . 
Willy attended diligently to the objects of his mission , and hastened from point to point making a faithful distribution of the secret circulars . 
But Willy was astonished to meet a familiar face on the ground , superintending the erection of the engine of death . 
Willy had seen him in the anterooms of the President and of the Postmaster General , at Washington ; and it was somewhat notorious that he contrived to hold office under different administrations of different politics . 
But whatever might have been his principles , he had certainly professed to be an admirer of President Randolph , and a supporter of his administration up to the period of the rupture of the sections ; and , therefore , Willy 's amazement was great on beholding this politician directing the construction of one of the Protector 's guillotines on Hartford common . 
Upon inquiry he learned that Rook had abandoned the Federal cause immediately after the battle of Burlington , and being among the first applicants for office under the new regime , he had obtained a commission from the Northern Convention when it re-assembled in New York , and so congratulated himself on his ability to retain his position . 
`` Mr. Rook , '' said Willy , when the former recognised him , and grasped his hand in a friendly manner , `` have you turned against the President ? '' 
Willy followed , and observed that Rook called aside the men who he supposed were to be commissioned , with whom , doubtless , satisfactory agreements were made in relation to the bonuses or commissions ; and then , at the hour appointed by Virus , the seals were broken in the midst of the assembled politicians . 
Amidst such scenes of summary punishment and terror , there could be no open manifestations of patriotism in New England ; and Willy did not linger long in it . 
But he observed with many painful forebodings that the lives and the fortunes of the entire population were completely at the disposal of the despot , Ruffleton , who would use them for the destruction of the Republic and the subjugation of the South . 
Upon his return to New York , Willy hastened to Mr. Lex and reported all he had seen and done . 
Willy next repaired to the City Hall . 
`` Wiry Willy has seen a great many ; and he 's tired of seeing men 's heads chopped off . '' 
`` Just the reverse , Willy , '' said Ruffleton , laughing heartily . 
Be my friend , Willy , and I will take care of you . 
`` All I ask , General , '' said Willy , `` is to be permitted to live in peace with my good grandame on the Brandywine . '' 
said Willy . 
And , while the Protector was about to write , Willy described the looks and actions of those to whom he had exhibited the Dictator 's autograph ; and the despot seemed pleased and amused . 
`` There , Willy ! 
`` Certainly , sir ; nobody troubles Willy , since General Crook was going to hang him . 
`` Thank you , Willy ; but it will not be necessary to come this far back . 
I shall move closer to him in a few days . '' 
asked Willy , quickly . 
Call again an hour hence , Willy , when my letters will be ready . 
`` Search Wiry Willy ? 
If I do n't deliver your letter safely into Lord Slysir 's hand , you may cut off Wiry Willy 's head , and he 'll never think hard of it . 
That is , if his Lordship is still there -- at the mansion . '' 
`` No doubt he 's there . 
Besides his bruises , I 'm inclined to think he has a wound of the heart , from one of his expressions . '' 
`` Wo n't that kill him , sir ? '' 
Willy withdrew , and loitered an hour in the Park , where he witnessed the decapitation of eleven victims . 
In New Jersey Willy experienced no diminution of his terrors . 
Willy hastened to the head-quarters of Randolph . 
He was admitted into the office , where he found Summers writing , and the President dictating . 
The clerk seemed startled on beholding Willy ; and a moment after , by permission , he withdrew . 
`` This day , Willy , '' said Randolph , `` I looked for your return . 
`` You certainly could not have heard what Major S -- whispered in my ear just before he suffered , '' said Willy . 
Deliver your letters , Willy . 
You will find Lord Slysir in his chamber , not yet quite recovered . '' 
The President resumed his labors , calling in another Secretary , while Willy repaired to his Lordship 's chamber . 
As he was about to enter the door , he was met by Summers , and his suspicions were confirmed . 
`` Summers , '' said he , pausing , when the Secretary had closed the door behind him , `` you do not seem curious to hear tidings from the Lord Protector . '' 
But , Willy , he shall never have me in his power again ! 
And , Willy , it may be possible that poor S -- supposed I had some agency in precipitating his doom ! 
But the letter he gave me for the President was perused by nobody before it was delivered to the one to whom it was directed . '' 
Willy mused in doubt . 
Has it , Willy ? '' 
Stay , Willy . 
Come to me again , Willy , for your reward . '' 
`` I desire none , sir , '' said Willy , withdrawing . 
The words whispered in the ear of Wiry Willy by Major S -- '' `` And so you have learned that secret . 
But did not Willy say he had previously imparted it too me ? 
Wiry Willy and Mary were married by one of the chaplains of the army ; and , after the ceremony , proceeded immediately to the peaceful cottage of Willy 's grandame on the Brandywine . 
Some one said Wiry Willy had arrived . 
Where is he ? '' 
`` He awaits permission to enter . 
I will send him in . 
`` Well , Willy , '' said the President , presenting his hand in a familiar manner , but without rising , for he was fatigued after the exercises of the day . 
`` No doubt , Willy . 
`` None , sir . 
He is certain of capturing Washington , and is already importuned by the fanatics to destroy it . 
`` It will be satisfied then , Willy ! '' 
Then -- but , Willy , I will not anticipate events . '' 
`` And that person , Willy , was probably no man . '' 
`` And , at the same time , he was writing to Edith ! 
You must tell her everything , Willy . 
Has his Lordship recovered ? '' 
`` He is quite well , sir ; and I am inclined to believe he was entirely recovered before you left New Castle . '' 
How long do you propose staying with us , Willy ? '' 
And , Willy , by whispering into the ear of Mr. A -- , the words , ` Randolph and the Union , ' he will conduct you to a place of safety where you may deposit them . 
Willy bowed with reverence , and lost not a moment in departing on his important mission . 
WhenWiry Willy reached Washington and whispered the mysterious words into the ear of Mr. A -- that gentleman 's face was wreathed in smiles . 
And , late as it was , he accompanied Willy up to the Little Falls of the Potomac , where , among the immense wilderness of mossy rocks strewn about by some convulsion of nature , the place of deposit was revealed . 
Returning to the Capital , Willy perceived with interest that all the hotels were still open , and many men , in excited conversation , were passing in and out , and alternately filling and emptying the saloons . 
Willy , upon hearing the news , hastened to the mansion of Senator Langdon , and succeeded in rousing Dick Clusky . 
`` I am Wiry Willy , '' said Willy . 
`` Wiry Willy ? 
Say Wiry Willy has arrived , with good news . '' 
Willy stepped into the vestibule , then faintly illuminated by a jet of gas kept constantly burning in the hall ; and Dick sped up-stairs to the chambers occupied by the Senator and his daughter . 
She met Willy with her usual frank cordiality , and led him into the parlor , which was soon brilliantly illuminated . 
`` Your news , Willy , '' said she ; `` I am all impatience . 
My father will be down in a few moments . 
said Willy , `` for , I believe , he will soon occupy the Chair in the Senate , the Vice-President being still incapacitated . '' 
`` And I have brought this letter for you , '' said Willy , `` in accordance with my promise . 
I will not break it , Willy ; but will merely certify to its faithful delivery with my pencil , and then , if you should see him again , you must return it into his own hand . 
`` Well , Willy , '' said the Senator , entering , and taking the hand of the messenger . 
We have heard of his junction with Blount , and -- '' `` I have not a word from him , sir , '' said Willy . 
`` But he will arrive in the Capital , I think , before many hours . 
Run to the hotels , Willy , and say so . 
said he , turning to his coachman , who , in disregard of all decorum , had been standing at the parlor door with eyes , ears , and mouth open , `` have the coach in readiness immediately . 
`` I come from Miss Alice , Captain Bim , '' said Willy . 
`` Wiry Willy ! '' 
`` Captain Fink , '' continued Willy , `` Miss Alice desires that you will wait further orders . '' 
Willy returned , followed by Bim and five of his men . 
Abel confessed everything ; and Wiry Willy arriving during the recital of the plan for the seizure of the President , was dispatched by Alice to summon Bim . 
Willy , see the driver and tell him when the rocket ascends to start , but to proceed very slowly . 
He must make no resistance at the bridge , and he need not endeavor to escape . '' 
Come Willy ! '' 
said Virus , leading the way into the boat , where Wiry Willy , and four oarsmen , seemed to be awaiting him . 
`` Oh , yes , '' said Willy , `` it was designed to hold us all . '' 
`` They are obeying orders , sir , '' said Willy , as the boat glided out into the river ; `` but we are not to follow the President far . '' 
`` Such is not the order , sir , '' said Willy ; `` but if it were , resistance would be vain . 
`` To the island , '' said Willy . 
`` Not more than knee deep , '' said Willy . 
`` Is that you , Wiry Willy ? '' 
`` Yes , Captain , '' said Willy , `` and I see that you have executed the President 's orders -- '' `` Miss Alice 's , sir -- yes , executed them to the letter , without the loss of a man -- I mean with the loss of but one man , and that could n't be prevented . 
`` Willy knows , '' was responded in the crowd . 
`` Willy ! '' 
he continued , when his eye detected the very demure face of Willy , `` now I shall learn all about him . 
`` General , '' said Willy , `` if you will promise not to guillotine me , I 'll show you Mr. Virus , and also his friend Windvane . '' 
But I promise , Willy . 
said Willy . 
`` I did , '' said Willy , `` and you 've promised not to punish me . '' 
You , Willy ? '' 
Gentlemen , '' said Ruffleton , turning to his Generals , `` Virus and Windvane were engaged in an enterprise for the capture of Randolph ; but instead of placing the last of the Presidents in my hands , the last of the Presidents -- and by George ! 
`` He ordered Willy to do it , '' repeated Willy , upon perceiving the rising anger of Ruffleton , the more he dwelt on the practical joke of Randolph . 
`` Yes , gentlemen , '' continued Ruffleton , elated with his success , and the fancied popularity of a prosecution of the invasion , `` we shall track him like a wolf to his lair , and he can not escape . 
ThePresident , well informed of the movements of the enemy , encamped his army in the vicinity of Alexandria , and then repaired to Mount Vernon , where his head-quarters were established . 
`` And where is Wiry Willy ? '' 
`` He was with us when we escaped the toils Virus and the treacherous Windvane had prepared . 
We left him in a boat on the river , having those evil plotters in custody -- but he was directed to release them on the island bar . 
Ever before Willy has been present in such critical times as the present ; and if he lives , and is at liberty , I am sure he is now rendering valuable services somewhere . 
It may be Willy himself . 
`` Your face is unclouded , Willy ! '' 
`` But why , Willy , '' demanded Alice , `` does he not think there will be a great battle ? 
`` No , '' said Willy . 
I was with his father during his last moments , and he gave me his watch , and other valuable articles , and among them the portrait of the General 's mother , to be delivered to his son ; but -- '' `` But what , Willy ? '' 
Nay , do not weep for him , sir , '' continued Willy , observing the tears rolling down the cheeks of Mr. Langdon . 
cried Willy himself , returning from the lawn , whither he had gone to reconnoitre . 
and seizing the hand of Edith and of her father , she hastened away , not doubting that Alice and Willy would follow . 
said Willy . 
Come , Willy , attend me to the ship . '' 
`` Willy ! 
said Willy , exhibiting the passports and protections of both Ruffleton and Slysir . 
stammered Willy . 
`` Wiry Willy only obeys General Ruffleton and Lord Slysir . '' 
`` Come , Willy ! '' 
Her eyes were blinded with tears ; and , taking Willy 's arm , she urged him away in the direction indicated by the Lieutenant . 
Wiry Willy went with her . '' 
A carriage was procured , and the prisoner , still attended by Willy , whose passport and protection from Ruffleton yet served him , was driven into the city . 
But upon learning that the officer had led the expedition against Mount Vernon , the destruction of which was already the subject of conversation in the city , and on seeing Willy 's credentials , the doorkeeper gave way , and conducted the party into the Green Room , through which Flora Summers was just then gliding . 
said Flora , in a low tone , and gently seizing the hand of Alice , led her into the next room , saying , as she withdrew , to the Lieutenant and Willy , `` Remain until I return , and hold no communication with any one . '' 
Flora then hastened back to the green room , where Junkins and Willy awaited her . 
`` Now , Willy , '' said Flora , `` I know you are a friend of Alice , of Randolph , and of the South -- '' `` Be pleased to look at this , '' said Willy , interrupting her , and presenting the passport and protection of Ruffleton . 
And where would you lead me ? 
he continued , inclined to extricate his arm from the grasp of the woman . 
exclaimed Willy , now clasping her hand and kissing it , `` how I have injured you in my thoughts ! 
`` It is not generous conduct , Willy ! 
The closet was near the door , and as dark within as midnight ; but Willy , the door being slightly open for the admission of air , had a partial view of the passage , then brilliantly illuminated , and might see into the room itself , when the door was open . 
He had not been long in concealment before he heard the heavy tread of some one , who he supposed might be Ruffleton , and held his breath in terror . 
But a moment afterwards he recognised the well remembered `` Hem ! '' 
Willy , peeping through the key-hole , having drawn the door quite close a moment before , saw his Lordship take a pinch of snuff , and then smile at a sudden conceit which occurred to him . 
But Willy 's terror may be imagined when he beheld his Lordship approach the closet in which he was concealed ! 
His Lordship pulled without , and Willy pulled within . 
said his Lordship . 
But he had not gone half-a-dozen paces before he was startled by the sneezing of Wiry Willy , who had imbibed some of his Lordship 's snuff through the key-hole . 
Willy heard Slysir 's departing steps , and soon after Flora glided softly past the closet and placed her ear near the door of the green room . 
After remaining in that attitude some time , she turned away and approached the closet in which Willy was concealed . 
`` Willy ! '' 
`` Willy ! '' 
she repeated , for he seemed reluctant to reply for fear of discovery by Ruffleton . 
asked Willy , on hearing her words . 
demanded Willy . 
said she , pushing in with some difficulty , destroying the shape of her crinoline , and crowding poor Willy without ceremony . 
`` Not yet , '' whispered Flora , after Ruffleton strode past , and when Willy manifested an impatience to escape from his place of concealment . 
Tell her so , Willy . 
said Willy . 
`` All we ask is an opportunity to get away . '' 
He then glided into the room , and immediately after the prisoner escaped from the rear window , assisted by Willy . 
said the officer , staggering up in front of Alice and Willy . 
`` You ca n't pass ; his Royal Highness , the Grand Protector , will cut off your heads -- eh ! 
said Willy , unfolding his passport , and stepping aside with the officer , where the rays of the lamp enabled him to decipher the autograph of Ruffleton . 
Willy made no reply ; but , with Alice clinging to his arm , strode onward , while the soldiers fell back , right and left , leaving a wide avenue . 
`` How did you obtain that , Willy ? '' 
`` Fortune favors the brave , Willy , '' said Alice , `` and we have prospered so far . 
And more than that , Willy : if needs be , in a desperate case , I can swim -- and the water is now warm and pleasant . 
Such were the thoughts of both Alice and Willy as they both glided on silently , for the weather was calm and the river smooth , near the island of rushes , where Virus and Windvane had been landed on the night of the President 's evacuation of the Capital . 
said Willy , and looking round at the silent assemblage of boats , and yet perceiving no human beings in them . 
`` And now , Willy , '' said Alice , `` why are you so silent ? '' 
`` I have been thinking -- '' `` Is that you , Wiry Willy ? '' 
But what were you thinking about , Willy ? '' 
I care not what Ruffleton and his army of traitors may say of me . 
`` And if they board us , '' said Willy , `` I have got a paper that will silence them . 
Now here 's my idea , but Willy put it in my head . 
Asthe skiff containing the fugitives glided past the British fleet , and when Alice and Willy began to breathe freer under the conviction that every obstacle had been surmounted , they were startled by a flash on the right , followed by the report of a cannon , and a terrible splash from the ball but a few fathoms ahead . 
`` Be bold , Willy , '' said Alice . 
`` Friends , '' said Willy , `` on the service of the Lord Protector . '' 
`` If that be so , '' said the officer , in a lower tone , as he approached the stern of the skiff , `` you shall pass . '' 
`` Come here , '' said Willy , `` and you shall see . '' 
Then striking a light with a match , he exhibited the signature of Ruffleton to his passport and protection . 
said Willy , `` for we have no time to lose . '' 
And as Alice , in reply to their congratulations , gave a large share of the merit to Wiry Willy , every one present grasped the young man 's hand in token of their approbation . 
Shortlyafter Randolph left Slysir , his Lordship , happening to see Wiry Willy , beckoned him into the library . 
`` Willy , '' said his Lordship , `` you see I am a prisoner again . 
Walk round behind me , Willy . 
`` I think your Lordship 's pantaloons , '' said Willy , `` may be a trifle too tight -- but that defect is mainly concealed by the coat . '' 
But the letter , Willy -- you remember the letter ? '' 
said Slysir , when Willy had gone out . 
said he , on perceiving Wiry Willy standing at his elbow . 
`` Now the letter , Willy ! '' 
`` Here it is , precisely as it came from her hand , '' said he , delivering it . 
said Willy . 
`` I know it , '' said Willy , with imperturbable gravity ; `` and have you it not in your possession ? '' 
`` By Jupiter , '' said his Lordship , with his glass to his eye , `` this is most extraordinary . '' 
`` And if your Lordship be not yet satisfied , '' said Willy , `` I am sure you will be very soon , for Miss Edith is to be married to General Blount within an hour from this time . '' 
Willy then sped away without marking his Lordship 's countenance . 
`` Come , Slysir , '' said General Crook , who entered and grasped his Lordship 's arm -- `` come with me to the chapel . 
At length , almost borne along by Bim , the ladies beheld the familiar face of Wiry Willy by the light of the silver lamp within the spacious apartment . 
Willy , cool your parched lips , lave the dust from your eyes , and bathe your temples ! '' 
In a brief time Willy seemed restored , and declined further ministrations from the fair hands of the young ladies . 
cried Bim , springing from his chair . 
Then sitting down , he indulged in such involuntary exclamations as these : `` I like that ! 
let 'em come ! '' 
He rose a second time , and was about to hasten away , when a gesture from Willy arrested him . 
`` Major , '' said he , `` I have later intelligence than is to be found in any of the letters . 
responded Willy in a whisper . 
Theoccupation of Richmond by Ruffleton , and the defeat of the British fleet in an attempt to enter Hampton Roads occurred on the same day ; and immediately upon the reception of intelligence of the disaster , Ruffleton sent Virus , his negotiator , to the head-quarters of Randolph . 
Send for Wiry Willy . '' 
A messenger brought in Willy , who readily undertook to perform the journey , not doubting his ability to notify the inmates of the Castle of the approaching danger in advance of the detachment 's arrival before the walls . 
`` Here is Wiry Willy , '' said Alice , `` entering just in time to answer the question I was about to ask . 
Willy , was his Lordship very pale when you took leave of him a few days ago ? '' 
`` Pale ? 
His face was as red as the sunny side of a Brandywine apple in October , '' said Willy . 
`` Say to his Lordship , '' responded Alice , after a pause , with averted face , `` that we hold the request under consideration , and that it is not yet either granted or denied . '' 
`` And say to him also , '' added Edith , `` that we have been enjoined in a communication from the brave General Crook , in any negotiations that may be conducted with the Envoy of her Britannic Majesty , to stipulate for the restitution of a certain article of property claimed by the said General as being exclusively his own , and not subject to legal detention or contraband -- '' `` Pray , lady , '' said Cuté , who had no knowledge of the matter alluded to , `` be more explicit . '' 
Gaze on -- but do not break the seal yet ; it was brought hither by one whom I have seen in Washington -- I know not his name , but Willy says he is anxious to enter the service of the President . '' 
Where 's Wiry Willy ? '' 
`` La , missus , '' said the foremost , `` he 's done gone to bed long ago ! '' 
`` Wake him up ! 
Tell him to come hither immediately ! '' 
Ah , Willy ! '' 
But , Willy , it isa necessity . 
said Willy . 
`` Willy , Windvane writes me -- confidentially , he says , but from you no confidence is withheld -- that the country -- p619-477 all the North , is ready to rise against the Usurper and Tyrant , and -- '' `` Windvane too ? '' 
said Willy . 
cried Willy , springing up from the chair he had occupied , in obedience to the injunction of Alice . 
She planned your escape and assisted -- '' `` I know it , Willy . 
Willy hastened to the chamber of his Lordship , and Alice seized her pen and wrote with great rapidity ; while Edith indited a letter to General Blount , to be borne by the messenger about setting out for the head-quarters of the President . 
Windvane , in directing his eyes towards the window , had recognised Wiry Willy below . 
`` Excuse me a moment , gentlemen , '' he continued ; `` I will myself conduct him hither . '' 
He passed out into the hall , and seeing Willy ascending the stairway , awaited his approach . 
`` Your letter , Willy , '' said Windvane . 
But , Willy , '' he continued , in a whisper , `` did she not send me a verbal message regarding Flora ? '' 
And after some further conversation with Willy , he told him his general news had been anticipated by telegraph , and special expresses , and therefore he need not go into the Council Chamber . 
And during the discussion that ensued , Flora retired from the chamber , and sent for Willy , whom Mrs. Punt was questioning , in high excitement , in regard to the movements of her absent husband . 
`` Willy , '' said Flora , `` why are you here ? '' 
`` I came , Miss Flora , '' said Willy , at the same time glancing round , that no one else might learn the nature of his mission , `` expressly to bear a letter to you from Miss Alice . '' 
she cried , starting up and almost seizing Willy . 
I knew it was a matter of importance to you , '' he continued , as he detached the false scalp from his head -- `` to you who have served Miss Alice so effectually when she most required assistance . '' 
Willy , I will never betray you ! '' 
said Willy . 
cried Flora , lifting her face , which had been momentarily concealed in her hands , and having forgotten the presence of Willy . 
said Willy . 
`` I thank you , Willy ! '' 
Yes , happiness awaits you there , Willy ! 
`` He should be concealed -- '' `` Alas ! 
you speak as if he were already a fugitive ! 
But , Willy , it has not come to that ! 
Willy ! 
Go , Willy , to your happy Mary ! 
And when the messenger withdrew , Flora indited a few lines in pencil mark on a card , demanding Colonel Snare 's presence immediately , and begged Willy to deliver it . 
Willy hastened away , and executed the trust without loss of time . 
Therewas a succession of excitements in the Castle after Wiry Willy had been sent to Washington . 
Willy , and Mary , and the grandame , were seated at the breakfast table , as the early sun of the morning threw its rosy tints on the peaceful valley of the Brandywine . 
`` Yes , '' said Willy , `` we shall have peace , now , and a lasting peace , I have no doubt . 
`` True , Willy , '' said Mary , who had always sympathized with the South , `` suchDisunion as was attempted by Ruffleton and General Crook . 
And throwing aside her veil , Willy and Mary recognised her face , though pale and careworn . 
said Flora , swallowing some coffee , which had been brought by Willy . 
`` Thank you , Willy ! 
A copy had likewise been received at the cottage , and Willy and Mary were already familiar with its contents , and they maintained a respectful silence while Flora glanced at the exciting items . 
`` I feared him -- and he sought to do me injury -- but that is forgiven -- for he has since been kind to Willy . '' 
`` To Willy -- yes ! 
I would trust Willy . 
But there is no necessity . 
He will meet me at the place appointed , if not taken -- and if he had been taken , would not the news have been in the paper ? 
Willy , you must not go with me ! 
I believe you would serve me -- but it is not necessary , and it might put you in trouble , for he is charged with the death of General Hudson .
