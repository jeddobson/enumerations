The second was Babbalanja , a man of a mystical aspect , habited in a voluminous robe . 
He was learned in Mardian lore ; much given to quotations from ancient and obsolete authorities : the Ponderings of Old Bardianna : the Pandects of Alla-Malolla . 
A youthful , long-haired , blue-eyed minstrel ; all fits and starts ; at times , absent of mind , and wan of cheek ; but always very neat and pretty in his apparel ; wearing the most becoming of turbans , a Bird of Paradise feather its plume , and sporting the gayest of sashes . 
In particular , Babbalanja had often expressed the most ardent desire to visit every one of the isles , in quest of some object , mysteriously hinted . 
He murmured deep concern for my loss , the sincerest sympathy ; and pressing my hand more than once , said lowly , `` Your pursuit is mine , noble Taji . 
But to my sorrow , I marked that both Mohi and Babbalanja , especially the last , seemed not so buoyant of hope , concerning lost Yillah , as the youthful Yoomy , and his high-spirited lord , King Media . 
First went the royal Elephant , carrying Media , myself , Jarl , and Samoa ; Mohi the Teller of Legends , Babbalanja , and Yoomy , and six vivacious paddlers ; their broad paddle-blades carved with the royal boars ' tusks , the same tattooed on their chests for a livery . 
As we pursued the path , walking between old Mohi the keeper of chronicles and Samoa the Upoluan , Babbalanja besought the former to enlighten a stranger concerning the history of this curious Peepi . 
Whereupon the chronicler gave us the following account ; for all of which he alone is responsible . 
asked Babbalanja . 
`` Away they go , '' said Babbalanja ; `` and , my lord , now that you mind me of it , I have often thought , that it is all folly and vanity for any man to attempt a dignified carriage . 
Why , my lord , '' -- frankly crossing his legs where he lay -- `` the king , who receives his embassadors with a majestic toss of the head , may have just recovered from the tooth-ache . 
`` Well put , Babbalanja ; come nearer ; here , cross your legs by mine ; you have risen a cubit in my regard Vee-Vee , bring us that gourd of wine ; so , pass it round with the cups . 
`` Mighty kings , and famous , doubtless , '' said Babbalanja , `` whose bones were thought worthy of so noble and enduring an urn . 
`` Why , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` since you intimate that they never had ghosts to give up , you ignore them in toto ; denying the very fact of their being even defunct . '' 
Said Yoomy , `` Then , Babbalanja , you account that a fit illustration of the miraculous change to be wrought in man after death ? '' 
Said Media , rising , `` Babbalanja , you have indeed put aside the courtier ; talking of worms and caterpillars to me , a king and a demi-god ! 
Said Yoomy , `` But those great and good deeds , Babbalanja , of which the philosophers so often discourse : must it not be sweet to believe that their memory will long survive us ; and we ourselves in them ? '' 
`` I speak now , '' said Babbalanja , `` of the ravening for fame ; which even appeased , like thirst slaked in the desert , yields no felicity , but only relief ; and which discriminates not in aught that will satisfy its cravings . 
`` In plain words by bethinking him of the glorious harvest of bravos his ghost would reap for him , '' said Babbalanja ; `` but Banjo , -- Bonjo , -- Binjo , -- I never heard of him . '' 
cried Babbalanja ; `` I fear me his harvest is not yet ripe . '' 
`` But now that you speak of unappreciated poets , Yoomy , '' said Babbalanja , `` Shall I give you a piece of my mind ? '' 
`` Do , '' said Mohi , stroking his beard . 
Long pondered Babbalanja ; then said , `` Carve it , my lord , deep into a ponderous stone , and sink it , face downward , into the sea ; for the unseen foundations of the deep are more enduring than the palpable tops of the mountains . '' 
`` What recks he of the ten kings , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Even so , '' said Babbalanja . 
Musing a moment , Babbalanja replied , `` My lord , that maxim may be good as it stands ; but had you made six words of it , instead of six syllables , you had uttered a better and a deeper . '' 
Fromseaward now came a breeze so blithesome and fresh , that it made us impatient of Babbalanja 's philosophy , and Mohi 's incredible legends . 
Said Babbalanja , `` The thrice waved oleanders , Yoomy ; what meant they ? '' 
`` Then that , at least , seems kindly meant , '' said Babbalanja ; `` Taji , beware of Hautia . '' 
`` Line of kings and row of scepters , '' said Babbalanja as he gazed . 
But no , no ; despise them not , oh Babbalanja ! 
And over the Coral Kings , Babbalanja paced in profound meditation . 
Upon this , his egregious misadventure , calculated to do discredit to our party , and bring Media himself into contempt , Babbalanja had no scruples in taking Jarl roundly to task . 
He assured him , that it argued but little brains to evince a desire to be thought familiar with all things ; that however desirable as incidental attainments , conventionalities , in themselves , were the very least of arbitrary trifles ; the knowledge of them , innate with no man . 
Marking all this , Babbalanja , who had been silently looking on , leaning against one of the palm pillars , quietly observed to Media : -- `` My lord , I have seen this same reef at Rafona . 
There we saw the viceroys of him who reigned in the hollow : chieftains of whom Donjalolo was proud ; so honest , humble , and faithful ; so bent upon ameliorating the condition of those under their rule . 
As still seeking Yillah , and still disappointed , we roved through the lands which these chieftains ruled , Babbalanja exclaimed -- `` Let us depart ; idle our search , in isles that have viceroys for kings . '' 
With animated courtesy our host received us ; assigning a neighboring bower for Babbalanja and the rest ; and among so many right-royal , demi-divine guests , how could the demi-gods Media and Taji be otherwise than at home ? 
said Babbalanja , peeping in , `` the live kings , or the dead ones ? '' 
`` But , Babbalanja , do you , who run a tilt at all things , suffer this silly conceit to be uttered with impunity in your presence ? 
`` I have been thinking , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` that though the people of that island may at times err , in imputing their calamities to the Plujii , that , nevertheless , upon the whole , they indulge in a reasonable belief . 
cried Babbalanja . 
`` It would seem , then , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , reclining , `` as if these men of Ohonoo had canonized the derelictions of their progenitors , though the same traits are deemed scandalous among themselves . 
Leave prose to Babbalanja , who is prosy enough . '' 
`` Even so , '' said Babbalanja , `` Yoomy , you have over-stepped your province . 
Said Babbalanja `` My lord , he fills wine cups for others to quaff . '' 
As beseemed him , Uhia was royally lodged . 
Ample his roof . 
But long since , he had disbanded his damsels . 
Springing from syren embrace -- `` They shall sap and mine me no more '' he cried `` my destiny commands me . 
So at it he went , and all Ohonoo helped him . 
Now , informed of all this , said Babbalanja to Media , `` My lord , if the continual looking-forward to something greater , be better than an acquiescence in things present ; then , wild as it is , this belief of Uhia 's he should hug to his heart , as erewhile his wives . 
But by far the most cogent , and pointed argument advanced in support of this story , is a spear which the priests of Keevi brought forth , for Babbalanja to view . 
`` Let me look at it closer , '' said Babbalanja . 
And turning it over and over and curiously inspecting it , `` Wonderful spear , '' he cried . 
To this Mohi , with some ire , was about to make answer , when , flinging over his shoulder a new fold of his mantle , Babbalanja spoke thus : `` Peace , rivals . 
`` Now , I appeal to you , royal Media ; to you , noble Taji ; to you , Babbalanja ; '' said the chronicler , with an impressive gesture , `` whether this seems a credible history : Yoomy has invented . '' 
`` But perhaps he has entertained , old Mohi , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Mohi , '' said Babbalanja , `` truth is in things , and not in words : truth is voiceless ; so at least saith old Bardianna . 
And I , Babbalanja , assert , that what are vulgarly called fictions are as much realities as the gross mattock of Dididi , the digger of trenches ; for things visible are but conceits of the eye : things imaginative , conceits of the fancy . 
`` No , '' said Babbalanja , `` a fence whose gate is ever kept open , seems unnecessary , I grant ; nevertheless , it gives a notable hint , otherwise not so aptly conveyed ; for is not the open gate the sign of the open heart ? '' 
`` Right , right , '' cried Borabolla ; `` so enter both , cousin Media ; '' and with one hand smiting his chest , with the other he waved us on . 
`` How jolly he is , '' whispered Media to Babbalanja . 
And now , while all present were crying out in admiration of Samoa 's artistic skill , and Samoa himself stood complacently regarding his workmanship , Babbalanja suggested , that it might be well to ascertain whether the patient survived . 
But Babbalanja held out to the last . 
`` Yet , if this story be true , '' said he , `` and since it is well settled , that our brains are somehow the organs of sense ; then , I see not why human reason could not be put into a pig , by letting into its cranium the contents of a man 's . 
But little they heeded Babbalanja . 
Whether it was , that he feared the avengers , whom he may have thought would follow on my track ; or whether the islands of Mardi answered not in attractiveness to the picture his fancy-had painted ; or whether the restraint put upon him by the domineering presence of King Media , was too irksome withal ; or whether , indeed , he relished not those disquisitions with which Babbalanja regaled us : however it may have been , certain it was , that Samoa was impatient of the voyage . 
He besought permission to return to Odo , there to await my return ; and a canoe of Mondoldo being about to proceed in that direction , permission was granted ; and departing for the other side of the island , from thence he embarked . 
Long after , dark tidings came , that at early dawn he had been found dead in the canoe : three arrows in his side . 
But Babbalanja averred , that the Upoluan was not the first man , who had turned back , after beginning a voyage like our own . 
`` Now , are you not a silly boy , '' said Babbalanja , `` when from the ambiguity of his speech , you could so easily have derived something flattering , thus to seek to extract unpleasantness from it ? 
`` And who is Tribonnora , '' said Babbalanja , `` that he thus bravely diverts himself , running down innocent paddlers ? '' 
Said Babbalanja , `` Then he is only like all of us . '' 
But just then a fiery fin-back whale , having broken into the paddock of the lagoon , threw up a high fountain of foam , almost under Tribonnora 's nose ; who , quickly turning about his canoe , cur-like slunk off ; his steering-paddle between his legs . 
Comments over ; `` Babbalanja , you were going to quote , '' said Media . 
`` My lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` here 's collateral proof ; -- the sage lawgiver Yamjamma , who flourished long before Bardianna , roundly asserts , that all men who knowingly do evil are bedeviled ; for good is happiness ; happiness the object of living ; and evil is not good . '' 
and he pointed ahead of our prow to three men in the water , urging themselves along , each with a paddle . 
`` Now , it is an extreme case , I grant , '' said Babbalanja , `` but those poor devils there , help to establish old Bardianna 's position . 
And so saying , he humorously commanded his attendants to lay hands upon the bedeviled philosopher , and place a bandage upon his mouth , that he might no more disseminate his devilish doctrine . 
Against this , Babbalanja demurred , protesting that he was no orang-outang , to be so rudely handled . 
Thus tantalized , Babbalanja displayed few signs of philosophy . 
And he commanded him to be bound hand and foot . 
At length , seeing all resistance ineffectual , Babbalanja submitted ; but not without many objurgations . 
Presently , however , they released him ; when Media inquired , how he relished the application of his theory ; and whether he was still of old Bardianna 's mind ? 
To which , haughtily adjusting his robe , Babbalanja replied , `` The strong arm , my lord , is no argument , though it overcomes all logic . '' 
cried Babbalanja , `` how comes it that thy shadow so broods over Mardi ; flinging new shades upon spots already shaded by the hill-sides ; shade upon shade ! '' 
`` No wonder , then , '' said Babbalanja , `` that the peak is inaccessible to man . 
`` Nevertheless , '' said Babbalanja , `` by some it is believed , that those , who by dint of hard struggling climb so high as to become invisible from the plain ; that these have attained the summit ; though others much doubt , whether their becoming invisible is not because of their having fallen , and perished by the way . '' 
`` True , my lord , '' said Babbalanja ; `` and Bardianna asserts that the plain alone was intended for man ; who should be content to dwell under the shade of its groves , though the roots thereof descend into the darkness of the earth . 
`` And hence , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` while others are charged with the business of their temporal welfare , these Islanders take no thought of the morrow ; and broad Maramma lies one fertile waste in the lagoon . '' 
Comingclose to the island , the pennons and trappings of our canoes were removed ; and Vee-Vee was commanded to descend from the shark 's mouth ; and for a time to lay aside his conch . 
Said Babbalanja , `` It looks not as if the lost one were here . '' 
`` I thought superfluities were worthless ; nay , sinful , '' said Babbalanja . 
Marking his blindness , whispered Babbalanja to Media , `` My lord , methinks this Pani must be a poor guide . 
`` He is one with eyes that see , '' made answer Babbalanja . 
Now , this was not altogether without effect ; for Pani and his fathers before him had always filled the office of guide . 
Nevertheless , Media at last decided , that , this time , Mohi should conduct us ; which being communicated to Pani , he desired us to remove from his roof . 
Apprized of their coming , Pani and his child went out to meet them ; and standing in the path he cried , `` I am the appointed guide ; in the name of Alma I conduct all pilgrims to the temples . '' 
But upon accosting him ; they were told , that he guided none without recompense . 
murmured Babbalanja . 
`` But a resurrection of bones , after all , '' said Babbalanja , ever osseous in his allusions to the departed . 
`` If this be so , Braid-Beard , '' said Babbalanja , `` our inmost thoughts are overheard ; but not by eaves-droppers . 
`` Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` no more of your abstrusities ; what know you mortals of us gods and demi-gods ? 
said Babbalanja . 
`` Have done , Babbalanja ! '' 
`` Do these attendants , then , '' said Babbalanja , `` so continually new-marshal the idols , that visiting the gallery today , you are at a loss to-morrow ? '' 
`` This must be Oloo , the god of Suicides , '' said Babbalanja . 
Hearing all this , Babbalanja thus spoke : -- `` Doubtless , my lord Media , besides these petitions we hear , there are ten thousand contradictory prayers ascending to these idols . 
Said Yoomy , `` But I would pray , nevertheless , Babbalanja ; for prayer draws us near to our own souls , and purifies our thoughts . 
Observing that all the images were more or less defaced , Babbalanja sought the reason . 
`` But behold , '' cried Babbalanja , `` there seems not a single image unmutilated . 
`` Not there ; not there ; '' cried Babbalanja , `` Yillah may have touched these shores ; but long since she must have fled . '' 
This narration concluded , Babbalanja mildly observed , `` Mohi : without seeking to accuse you of uttering falsehoods ; since what you relate rests not upon testimony of your own ; permit me , to question the fidelity of your account of Alma . 
Trust me , my lord , there is no man , that bears more in mind the necessity of being either a believer or a hypocrite in Maramma , and the imminent peril of being honest here , than I , Babbalanja . 
demanded Babbalanja of Mohi , who in substance related it . 
persisted Babbalanja . 
And wrapping round him his mantle , Babbalanja retired into its most private folds . 
`` How easily they are seen through , '' said Babbalanja , taking a sight through one of the heads . 
Seeing that Hevaneva handled his wares with much familiarity , not to say irreverence , Babbalanja was minded to learn from him , what he thought of his trade ; whether the images he made were genuine or spurious ; in a word , whether he believed in his gods . 
His reply was curious . 
But still more so , the marginal gestures wherewith he helped out the text . 
`` When I cut down the trees for my idols , '' said he , `` they are nothing but logs ; when upon those logs , I chalk out the figures of my images , they yet remain logs ; when the chisel is applied , logs they are still ; and when all complete , I at last stand them up in my studio , even then they are logs . 
`` You must make a very great variety , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` And so it will ever be , '' said Babbalanja . 
Havingtaken to our canoes once again , we were silently sailing along , when Media observed , `` Babbalanja ; though I seldom trouble myself with such thoughts , I have just been thinking , how difficult it must be , for the more ignorant sort of people , to decide upon what particular image to worship as a guardian deity , when in Maramma , it seems , there exists such a multitude of idols , and a thousand more are to be heard of . '' 
`` Once upon a time , then , '' said Babbalanja , indifferently adjusting his girdle , `` nine blind men , with uncommonly long noses , set out on their travels to see the great island on which they were born . '' 
Continued Babbalanja , `` Staff in hand , they traveled ; one in advance of the other ; each man with his palm upon the shoulder next him ; and he with the longest nose took the lead of the file . 
Why , Babbalanja , no demi-god could surpass it . 
`` But , Babbalanja , what under the sun , mean you by your blind story ! '' 
`` Others may , '' said Babbalanja . 
Glidingon , suddenly we spied a solitary Islander putting out in his canoe from a neighboring cove . 
Rapidly crossing this place , Yoomy 's hands to his ears , old Mohi 's to his nostrils , and Babbalanja vainly trying to walk with closed eyes , we toiled among steep , flinty rocks , along a wild , zigzag pathway ; like a mule-track in the Andes , not so much onward as upward ; Yoomy above Babbalanja , my lord Media above him , and Braid-Beard , our guide , in the air , above all . 
Whereupon thus discoursed Babbalanja : `` Gentle Yoomy , be not astounded , that Hivohitee is so far behind your previous conceptions . 
said Babbalanja , `` have you ? '' 
`` Thus , '' exclaimed Babbalanja , `` does Mardi , blind though it be in many things , collectively behold the marvels , which one pair of eyes sees not . '' 
`` And we must on , '' said Babbalanja . 
When day came , reclining beneath the canopy , Babbalanja would fain have seriously discussed those things we had lately been seeing , which , for all the occasional levity he had recently evinced , seemed very near his heart . 
`` Meditate as much as you will , '' Babbalanja , `` but say little aloud , unless in a merry and mythical way . 
Furthermore , Babbalanja , on this head , final , last thoughts you mortals have none ; nor can have ; and , at bottom , your own fleeting fancies are too often secrets to yourselves ; and sooner may you get another 's secret , than your own . 
Babbalanja , you mortals dwell in Mardi , and it is impossible to get elsewhere . '' 
Said Babbalanja , `` My lord , you school me . 
And seated apart , on both sides of the barge , solemnly swaying , in fixed meditation , to the roll of the waves , Babbalanja , Mohi , and Yoomy , drooped lower and lower , like funeral plumes ; and our gloomy canoe seemed a hearse . 
But Babbalanja 's was of a different sort ; an immense , black , serpentine stem of ebony , coiling this way and that , in endless convolutions , like an anaconda round a traveler in Brazil . 
Smoking this hydra , Babbalanja looked as if playing upon the trombone . 
`` So calm , '' said Babbalanja ; `` the very gods must be smoking now . '' 
`` Delighted to do so , my lord , '' replied Mohi , slowly disentangling his mouth-piece from the braids of his beard . 
`` Why , old Braid-Beard , '' cried Media , placing his pipe in rest , `` you are almost as erudite as our philosopher here . '' 
`` Much more so , my lord , '' said Babbalanja ; `` for Mohi has somehow picked up all my worthless forgettings , which are more than my valuable rememberings . '' 
cried Mohi , shaking his braids , like an enraged elephant with many trunks . '' 
`` For one , '' said Babbalanja , `` I 'll not believe that , till you prove to me , Braid-Beard , that ideas themselves are found imbedded therein . '' 
And throwing back his hoary old head , he jetted forth his vapors like a whale . 
cried Babbalanja . 
`` And that immortalized Rondo , no doubt , '' said Babbalanja . 
Braid-Beard , '' said Babbalanja . 
cried Babbalanja , `` comes sweet scented ambergris from those musky and chain-plated river cavalry ? 
`` Nor , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` would it have been wise to kill the fish that dropped such treasures : no more than to murder the noddy that laid the golden eggs . '' 
a noddy it must have been , '' gurgled Mohi through his pipe-stem , `` to lay golden eggs for others to hatch . '' 
`` But unlike our craniums , stocked full of concretions , '' said Babbalanja , `` our pipe-bowls never need clearing out . '' 
`` Well said , old man , '' cried Babbalanja ; `` for , like a good wife , a pipe is a friend and companion for life . 
`` Puff , puff , how we puff , '' cried Babbalanja . 
`` Ay , '' said Babbalanja , `` not more smoke in that skullbowl of yours than in the skull on your shoulders : both ends alike . '' 
`` So with pipes and puffs for a chorus , thus Yoomy sang : -- `` Ay , puff away , '' cried Babbalanja , `` puff , puff , so we are born , and so die . 
`` Truly , Oh-Oh , '' said Babbalanja , `` your discoveries must ere long result in something grand ; since you furnish such invaluable data for theorists . 
`` But Oh-Oh , '' said Babbalanja , `` what other discoveries have you made ? 
`` This way , this way , my masters , '' cried Oh-Oh , aloft , swinging his dim torch . 
`` So it seems , '' said Babbalanja , wide-groping , as he descended lower and lower . 
Upon gaining the vault , forth flew a score or two of bats , extinguishing the flambeau , and leaving us in darkness , like Belzoni deserted by his Arabs in the heart of a pyramid . 
Peering into a dark crypt , Babbalanja drew forth a few crumbling , illegible , black-letter sheets of his favorite old essayist , brave Bardianna . 
Silently Babbalanja pressed them to his heart . 
Piously he folded the shreds of manuscript together , kissed them , and laid them down . 
Then approaching Oh-Oh , he besought him for one leaf , one shred of those most precious pages , in memory of Bardianna , and for the love of him . 
But learning who he was , one of that old Ponderer 's commentators , Oh-Oh tottered toward the manuscripts ; with trembling fingers told them over , one by one , and said -- `` Thank Oro ! 
All in vain ; Oh-Oh was an antiquary , Turning in despair , Babbalanja spied a heap of wormeaten parchment covers , and many clippings and parings . 
Turning over this pile , Babbalanja lighted upon something that restored his good humor . 
Long he looked it over delighted ; but bethinking him , that he must have dragged to day some lost work of the collection , and much desirous of possessing it , he made bold again to ply Oh-Oh ; offering a tempting price for his discovery . 
And Babbalanja placed it in his vestment . 
But as for that Babbalanja of ours , he must needs go and lunch by himself , and , like a cannibal , feed upon an author ; though in other respects he was not so partial to bones . 
Babbalanja ! '' 
`` Come , list , Babbalanja , '' cried Yoomy , `` I am going to sing . '' 
Mohi , obeying , found him at home ; and Babbalanja started up . 
cried Babbalanja , in an ecstasy . 
Said Babbalanja , `` Listen again : -- ` Righteousness is sociable and gentle ; free , steady , and fearless ; full of inexhaustible delights . ' 
`` Then , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` keep your treasure to yourself . 
No more , Babbalanja . '' 
`` Have you that , then , of which you speak , Babbalanja ? 
`` Away : '' said Babbalanja serenely , `` I revive . '' 
But Babbalanja declared , that long since he must have drawn his own dentals , and bagged them with the rest . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` Vivo , the Sophist , '' said Babbalanja , turning aside . 
In the hearing of Jiji , allusion was made to Oh-Oh , as a neighbor of his . 
Whereupon he vented much slavering opprobrium upon that miserable old hump-back ; who accumulated useless monstrosities ; throwing away the precious teeth , which otherwise might have sensibly rattled in his own pelican pouches . 
When we quitted the hovel , Jiji , marking little Vee-Vee , from whose shoulder hung a calabash of edibles , seized the hem of his garment and besought him for one mouthful of food ; for nothing had he tasted that day The boy tossed him a yam . 
Sailingfrom Padulla , after many pleasant things had been said concerning the sights there beheld ; Babbalanja thus addressed Yoomy -- `` Warbler , the last song you sung was about moonlight , and paradise , and fabulous pleasures evermore : now , have you any hymns about earthly felicity ? '' 
`` No : like the roots of your beard , old Mohi , all beginnings are stiff , '' cried Babbalanja . 
So sing away , Yoomy , where you left off , '' and thus saying he unloosed his girdle for the song , as Apicius would for a banquet . 
`` Right , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` for Fame is not always so honest . 
`` Braid-Beard , you are witty , '' said Babbalanja , adjusting his robe . 
`` My lord Media , too , is witty , Babbalanja , '' said Mohi . 
Said Babbalanja , `` Very clever , my lord ; but think you not , there are men eloquent , who never babble in the marketplace ? '' 
In few words , Babbalanja , you espouse a bad cause . 
`` And what said Botargo , '' cried Babbalanja , `` hearing that his poems had been translated into the language of the remote island of Bertranda ? 
`` Ay , '' cried Babbalanja , `` ` Bravos , ' saith old Bardianna , but induce flatulency . ' '' 
`` Wax not so warm , Babbalanja ; but tell us , if to his contemporaries Vavona 's person was almost unknown , what satisfaction did he derive from his genius ? '' 
`` Had he not its consciousness ? 
What to him were huzzas ? 
Fame has dropped more rolls than she displays ; and there are more lost chronicles , than the perished books of the historian Livella . ' 
Said Babbalanja , `` Bear witness , ye gods ! 
`` A truce to your everlasting pratings of old Bardianna , '' said King Media ; `` why not speak your own thoughts , Babbalanja ? 
`` And there , for Oro 's sake , let it rest , Babbalanja ; Bardianna in you , and you in Bardianna forever ! '' 
sighed Babbalanja , `` how it quenches in one the thought of immortality , to think that these Tapparians too , will hereafter claim each a niche ! '' 
said Babbalanja ; `` no Yillah is here . '' 
`` 'T is my humor , Babbalanja . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Babbalanja , `` their lives are a continual farce , gratuitously performed for the diversion of Mardi . 
And so saying , he put off his robe for one less pretentious . 
Said Babbalanja , turning , `` You perceive , my lord Media , that these varlets take after their masters ; who feed none but the well-fed , and house none but the well-housed . '' 
Excessively thirsty , Babbalanja made bold to inquire for water ; which called forth a burst of horror from the old Begum , and minor shrieks from her daughters ; who declared , that the beverage to which remote reference had been made , was far too widely diffused in Mardi , to be at all esteemed in Pimminee . 
said Babbalanja . 
A goblet of this beverage was now handed Babbalanja ; but having a curious , gummy flavor , it proved any thing but palatable . 
Among the crowd was a bustling somebody , one Gaddi , arrayed in much apparel to little purpose ; who , singling out Babbalanja , for some time adhered to his side , and with excessive complaisance , enlightened him as to the people assembled . 
And so saying , Gaddi sauntered off ; his place by Babbalanja 's side being immediately supplied by the damsel Finfi . 
But after going the rounds of the company , and paying court to many , he again sauntered by Babbalanja , saying , `` Nobody , nobody ; nobody but nobodies ; I see nobody I know . '' 
`` Oh ye Tapparians , '' said Babbalanja , `` none so easily humbugged as humbugs . 
When all were pleasantly seated beneath the canopy , pipes in full blast , calabashes revolving , and the paddlers quietly urging us along , Media proposed that , for the benefit of the company , some one present , in a pithy , whiffy sentence or two , should sum up the character of the Tapparians ; and ended by nominating Babbalanja to that office . 
Can none be in your company , Babbalanja , but you must perforce make them hob-a-nob with that old prater ? 
`` A good blow and well planted , Babbalanja . '' 
`` In sooth , a most excellent saying ; it should be carved upon his tombstone , '' said Mohi , slowly withdrawing his pipe `` What ! 
`` What did some one say to me , not long since , Babbalanja , when in the matter of that sleepy song of mine , Braid-Beard bestowed upon me an equivocal compliment ? 
`` Tell me , Yoomy , '' said Babbalanja , `` are you not in fault ? 
It is you who are in fault , Babbalanja ; not I , craving your pardon . '' 
`` This , then , thrice gentle Yoomy , is what I would say ; '' resumed Babbalanja , `` that since we philosophers bestow so much wisdom upon others , it is not to be wondered at , if now and then we find what is left in us too small for our necessities . 
Babbalanja : sententiously you have acquitted yourself to admiration ; now amplify , and tell us more of the people of Pimminee . '' 
`` I mean , '' said Babbalanja , `` that all subjects are inexhaustible , however trivial ; as the mathematical point , put in motion , is capable of being produced into an infinite line . '' 
Do you , Babbalanja , come to the point , and not travel off with it , which is too much your wont . '' 
`` Let us land , then , '' said Babbalanja . 
Said Media , `` Expound you , then , sage Babbalanja . '' 
Muffling his face in his mantle , and his voice in sepulchral tones , Babbalanja thus : -- `` These are the leaves of the book of Oro . 
-- Go on , Babbalanja . '' 
cried Babbalanja , bowing to his feet . 
While all stood gazing on this sight , there came two servitors of Media 's , who besought of Babbalanja to settle a dispute , concerning certain tracings upon the islet 's other side . 
Said Babbalanja , starting , `` Is not this the very question concerning which they made such dire contention in Maramma , whose tertiary rocks are chisseled all over with these marks ? 
Strolling on , many marvels did we mark ; and Media said : -- `` Babbalanja , you love all mysteries ; here 's a fitting theme . 
Mohi tells us , that Mardi was made in six days ; but you , Babbalanja , have built it up from the bottom in less than six minutes . '' 
And so saying , Babbalanja turned aside . 
`` Gogle-goggle , fugle-fi , fugle-fogle-orum , '' so hummed to himself Babbalanja , slowly pacing over the fossils . 
`` Are you crazy , Babbalanja ? '' 
Know you aught yet unrevealed by Babbalanja ? '' 
`` How mad our Babbalanja is , '' cried Mohi . 
`` Hark ye , Babbalanja , '' cried Media , `` enough of this : doff your devil , and be a man . '' 
so : now , my lord , I 'm only Babbalanja . '' 
`` Answer , Babbalanja . '' 
cried Babbalanja . 
`` They harbored deadly malice , '' said Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja , I grieve the moon is gone . 
`` The three avengers fly three bolts , '' said Babbalanja . 
They brought it to him . 
Then said Babbalanja , `` Aleema 's sons raved not ; 't is true , then , Taji , that an evil deed gained you your Yillah : no wonder she is lost . '' 
Some remedies applied , and the company grown composed , Babbalanja thus : -- `` My lord Media , was there any human necessity for that accident ? '' 
`` None that I know , or care to tell , Babbalanja . '' 
`` Vee-Vee , '' said Babbalanja , `` did you fall on purpose ? '' 
`` Not I , '' sobbed little Vee-Vee , slinging his ailing arm in its mate . 
woe to us all , then , '' cried Babbalanja ; `` for what direful events may be in store for us which we can not avoid . '' 
`` Nay , '' said Media ; `` pause , Babbalanja . 
`` Well , well , Babbalanja , I grant it all . 
Continued Babbalanja , `` Previous to the time assigned to their fulfillment , those prophecies were bruited through Mardi ; hence , previous to the time assigned to their fulfillment , full knowledge of them may have come to the nations concerned . 
`` Go on , Babbalanja , '' said Media . 
`` No , minstrel , '' said Babbalanja ; `` and no need have the great gods to discourse of things perfectly comprehended by them , and by themselves ordained . 
But talk not of my kinsmen so fluently , Babbalanja . 
`` You have done marvels , Babbalanja . 
`` So you mortals teach , Babbalanja . '' 
`` Why , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` I almost pity you . 
Babbalanja , you almost affect my immortal serenity . 
Babbalanja , if you have any belief of your own , keep it ; but , in Oro 's name , keep it secret . '' 
said Media , `` what say you to that , now , Babbalanja ? '' 
`` Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` you did right in selecting this ebon night for discussing the theme you did ; and truly , you mortals are but too apt to talk in the dark . '' 
So saying , Babbalanja slowly drooped , and fell reclining ; then lay motionless as the marble Gladiator , that for centuries has been dying . 
But that night , he filled his flagon fuller than his wont , and drank , and drank , and pledged the stars . 
And Babbalanja abated his reveries . 
`` Alas , '' cried Babbalanja , `` do the fairies then wait on repletion ? 
`` I fear me , my lord will get nothing out of that witness , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Try again minstrel , '' cried Babbalanja . 
`` His devil is even more subtle than yours , Babbalanja . 
Let him go . '' 
said Babbalanja . 
cried Babbalanja , as turning the bold promontory of an uninhabited shore , many distant lands bluely loomed into view . 
cried Babbalanja , erect , and gazing abroad . 
he cried , as in obedience to Media , the paddlers suddenly altered our course . 
And warning all , that he himself had not composed the odious chant , Yoomy thus : -- `` By Oro ! 
cried Media , `` but Yoomy has well nigh stirred up all Babbalanja 's devils in me . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` There be those in Mardi , '' said Babbalanja , `` who would never ascribe evil to others , did they not find it in their own hearts ; believing none can be different from themselves . '' 
`` Thou art becoming flighty , even as Babbalanja , when Azzageddi is uppermost . '' 
`` Nor me , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Yoomy : poets both , we differ but in seeming ; thy airiest conceits are as the shadows of my deepest ponderings ; though Yoomy soars , and Babbalanja dives , both meet at last . 
In his old-fashioned way , having related all this , with many other particulars , Mohi was interrupted by Babbalanja , who inquired how the people of Diranda relished the games , and how they fancied being coolly thinned out in that manner . 
cried Babbalanja . 
Nor will the splintering thereof cease , till this pugnacious animal we treat of be deprived of his natural maces : videlicet , his arms . 
And right well doth man love to bruise and batter all occiputs in his vicinity . '' ' 
`` That incorrigible Azzageddi again , '' said Media , `` Proceed with your quotation , Babbalanja . '' 
asked Babbalanja . 
`` I yield , Babbalanja ; your old Ponderer is older than I. '' `` Ay , ay , Braid-Beard ; his crest was a tortoise ; and this was the motto : -- ` I bite , but am not to be bitten . '' ' 
`` Still the avengers follow , '' said Babbalanja . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` None know , Babbalanja ; but the poet must be still singing to himself ; his songs bursting through the turf , in the flowers over his grave . '' 
Would that I had been the poet , Babbalanja ; for then had I been famous indeed ; those lines are chanted through all the isles , by prince and peasant . 
`` My lord , my lord , '' cried Babbalanja , `` but this were to be truly immortal ; -- to be perpetuated in our works , and not in our names . 
Aninterval of silence was at last broken by Babbalanja . 
Pointing to the sun , just gaining the horizon , he exclaimed , `` As old Bardianna says -- shut your eyes , and believe . '' 
To you , perhaps , I seem Babbalanja ; but to myself , I seem not myself . 
As vanity , I regard the praises of my friends ; for what they commend pertains not to me , Babbalanja ; but to this unknown something that forces me to it . 
-- `` But Babbalanja , have you mortals no moral sense , as they call it ? '' 
`` That will do , Babbalanja ; you are on the verge , take not the leap ! 
`` Well , then , my lord , -- Azzageddi still set aside , -- upon that self-same inscrutable stranger , I charge all those past actions of mine , which in the retrospect appear to me such eminent folly , that I am confident , it was not I , Babbalanja , now speaking , that committed them . 
`` Will you never come to the mark , Babbalanja ? 
Who , what is he ? 
Introduce him . '' 
`` Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` you have fairly turned yourself inside out . '' 
`` How is that , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` is a circle square ? '' 
Now , Babbalanja , do you not imagine , that you may do harm by disseminating these sophisms of yours ; which like your devil theory , would seem to relieve all Mardi from moral accountability ? '' 
`` Again on the verge , Babbalanja ? 
`` It has snapped , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` To return to the vagueness of the notion I have of myself , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` There are times when I fancy myself a lunatic , '' resumed Babbalanja . 
`` Surely you forget , Babbalanja , '' said Media . 
`` But I was doing it unconsciously , '' said Mohi , dropping his hand , and lifting his head . 
`` Now , then , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` what have you come to in all this rhapsody ? 
`` Enough , enough , Babbalanja , '' cried Media . 
`` Ay , '' said Babbalanja , `` safer the center of peril , than the circumference . '' 
`` But natural , old man , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` A good commentary on old Bardianna , Yoomy , '' said Babbalanja , `` who somewhere says , that no Mardian can out with his heart , for his unyielding ribs are in the way . 
`` Very true , Babbalanja ; and I suppose that pride was at the bottom of your old Ponderer 's heartless , unsentimental , bald-pated style . '' 
In his essay , entitled , -- `` On the Tendency to curl in Upper Lips , '' he thus discourses . 
`` At bottom we are already equal , my honored lord , '' said Babbalanja , profoundly bowing -- `` One way we all come into Mardi , and one way we withdraw . 
`` Roughly worded , that , Babbalanja . 
-- So ; now , Babbalanja , try if you can not polish Bardianna 's style in that last saying you father upon him . '' 
`` I will , my ever honorable lord , '' said Babbalanja , salaming . 
-- well done , Babbalanja ; but I bade you polish , not sharpen the arrow . '' 
`` Ay , old man , '' said Babbalanja , `` many of us Mardians are but sorry hosts to ourselves . 
`` Did Babbalanja speak ? '' 
Eyeing his goblet , Media at length threw himself back , and said : `` Babbalanja , not ten minutes since , we were all absent-minded ; now , how would you like to step out of your body , in reality ; and , as a spirit , haunt some shadowy grove ? '' 
`` But our lungs are not wholly superfluous , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , speaking loud . 
`` No , nor our lips , '' said Mohi , smacking his over his wine . 
`` But could you really be disembodied here in Mardi , Babbalanja , how would you fancy it ? '' 
`` My lord , '' said Babbalanja , speaking through half of a nectarine , `` defer putting that question , I beseech , till after my appetite is satisfied ; for , trust me , no hungry mortal would forfeit his palate , to be resolved into the impalpable . '' 
`` Yet pure spirits we must all become at last , Babbalanja , '' said Yoomy , `` even the most ignoble . '' 
`` My lord , '' said Mohi , `` we have come to the lees ; your pardon , Babbalanja . '' 
Your cup , Babbalanja ; any lees ? '' 
`` Flood them over , then ; but cease not discoursing ; thanks be to the gods , your mortal palates and tongues can both wag together ; fill up , I say , Babbalanja ; you are no philosopher , if you stop at the tenth cup ; endurance is the test of philosophy all Mardi over ; drink , I say , and make us wise by precept and example . 
Just now , Babbalanja , you flew from the subject ; -- you spoke of boors ; but has not the lowliest peasant an eye that can take in the vast horizon at a sweep : mountains , vales , plains , and oceans ? 
said Babbalanja , winking . 
`` I have , '' said Babbalanja , feeling for it ; `` I am finished off at the helm very much as other Mardians , Mohi . '' 
Now , Babbalanja , I have this cup to drink , and then a question to propound . 
`` My lord Media , '' said Babbalanja , `` During my absence , my wife would have more reason to conclude that I was not living , than that I was . 
`` Heed him not , Babbalanja , '' said Media . 
Then , lifting his cup , `` My lord , serenely do I pity all such who are stirred one jot from their centers by ever so much drinking of this fluid . 
But come , Babbalanja , my gold-headed aquila , return to your theme ; -- the imagination , if you please . '' 
`` Without it -- '' continued Babbalanja . 
demanded Media , starting to his feet . 
Traitor , I 'll stand by this to the last gasp ; you are inebriated , Babbalanja . '' 
Return to your subject , Babbalanja . 
Assume now , Babbalanja , -- assume , my dear prince -- assume it , assume it , I say ! 
-- then -- then so much for your metaphysics , Bab -- Babbalanja . '' 
Babbalanja rose to his feet , muttering to himself -- `` Is this assumed , or real ? 
But he was wondrous keen ! 
He felled me , ere he fell himself . '' 
But finding the wind ahead , and the current too strong for our paddlers , we were fain to forego our destination ; Babbalanja observing , that since in Dominora we had not found Yillah , then in Kaleedoni the maiden could not be lurking . 
Hearth-stone , from which its children run , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` By way of enlarging his family circle , '' said Babbalanja , `` an old lion once introduced a deserted young stag to his den ; but the stag never became domesticated , and would still charge upon his foster-brothers . 
`` But Babbalanja , is there no way of reconciling these foes ? '' 
`` But , Babbalanja , '' said Yoomy , `` what asks Verdanna of Dominora , that Verdanna so clamors at the denial ? '' 
`` King Bello 's idea , '' said Babbalanja ; `` but , in these things , my lord , you demi-gods are ever unanimous . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` But my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` as truth , omnipresent , lurks in all things , even in lies : so , does some germ of it lurk in the calumnies heaped on the people of this land . 
-- What do you mean , Babbalanja ? '' 
my lord , '' cried Babbalanja . 
`` Yet for all this , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` Bello but holds lunatic Verdanna 's lands in trust . '' 
`` What would youdo , Babbalanja , '' said Media . 
`` Now , though these evils pose us all , '' said Babbalanja , `` there lately died in Verdanna , one , who set about curing them in a humane and peaceable way , waving war and bloodshed . 
`` Babbalanja , '' said Mohi , `` my lord has been pleased to pronounce Verdanna crazy ; now , may not her craziness arise from the irritating , tantalizing practices of Dominora ? '' 
`` It shows neither sense , nor spirit , nor humanity , '' said Babbalanja . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` Consult the botanists , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Babbalanja ! 
cried Babbalanja , `` but turn the medal , my lord ; -- what says the reverse ? '' 
`` Patience needs no prophet , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` But a new vent , my lord , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` You look pale , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` while all other faces glow ; -- Yoomy , doff that halo in the presence of a king . '' 
`` Recline , recline , my lord , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Not so , old man , '' said Babbalanja , `` when that day dawns , ` twill dawn serene . 
`` Yet the fires they kindle there are soon extinguished , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` My lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` where'ere she hide , ne'er yet did Yillah lurk in this Porpheero ; nor have we missed the maiden , noble Taji ! 
`` True , minstrel , '' said Babbalanja , `` and prairies are purified by fire . 
`` Be not too sanguine , gentle Yoomy , '' said Babbalanja . 
Vivenza shows no trophies of the summer time , but Dominora 's full-blown rose hangs blushing on her garden walls ; her autumn groves are glory-dyed . '' 
Once again , old Mohi serenely unbraided , and rebraided his beard ; and sitting Turk-wise on his mat , my lord Media smoking his gonfalon , diverted himself with the wild songs of Yoomy , the wild chronicles of Mohi , or the still wilder speculations of Babbalanja ; now and then , as from pitcher to pitcher , pouring royal old wine down his soul . 
Among other things , Media , who at times turned over Babbalanja for an encyclopædia , however unreliable , demanded information upon the subject of neap tides and their alleged slavish vassalage to the moon . 
When true to his cyclopædiatic nature , Babbalanja quoted from a still older and better authority than himself ; in brief , from no other than eternal Bardianna . 
It seems that that worthy essayist had discussed the whole matter in a chapter thus headed : `` On Seeing into Mysteries through Mill-Stones ; '' and throughout his disquisitions he evinced such a profundity of research , though delivered in a style somewhat equivocal , that the company were much struck by the erudition displayed . 
`` Babbalanja , that Bardianna of yours must have been a wonderful student , '' said Media after a pause , `` no doubt he consumed whole thickets of rush-lights . '' 
Why not follow it , Babbalanja ? '' 
`` True to your nature , Babbalanja ; you stay nowhere . '' 
Offended at which breach of decorum , Media sharply rebuked him . 
But he protested he could not help laughing . 
Again Media was about to reprimand him , when Babbalanja begged leave to interfere . 
`` But his body is his own , Babbalanja ; and he should have it under better control . '' 
`` You mortals are alive , then , when you are dead , Babbalanja . '' 
Wherefore , that saying imputed to Alma , and which , by his very followers , is deemed the most hard to believe of all his instructions , and the most at variance with all preconceived notions of immortality , I Babbalanja , account the most reasonable of his doctrinal teachings . 
`` Pray , Babbalanja , talk not of resurrections to a demi-god . '' 
`` But , my lord , '' continued Babbalanja , `` some creatures have still more perverse bodies than Grando 's . 
`` True as truth , '' said Babbalanja ; `` the Polyp will live turned inside out . '' 
-- `` But methinks , Babbalanja , that somewhere I have heard something about organic functions , so called ; which may account for the phenomena you mention ; and I have heard too , methinks , of what are called reflex actions of the nerves , which , duly considered , might deprive of its strangeness that story of yours concerning Grando and his body . '' 
asked Mohi , wriggling in his seat . 
`` Babbalanja , '' said Mohi , `` you must be the last of the kangaroos . '' 
`` Not so , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` A very fine invocation , '' said Media , `` now Babbalanja , be seated ; and tell us whether Dominora and the kings of Porpheero do not own some small portion of this great continent , which just now you poetically pronounced as the spoil of any vagabonds who may choose to settle therein ? 
said Babbalanja . 
After much screwing of his eyes , for those characters were very minute , Champollion Mohi thus spoke -- `` Exceptthe-tribe-of-Hamo . '' 
`` It seems to have been added for a postscript , '' rejoined Braid-Beard , screwing his eyes again . 
`` Perhaps so , '' said Babbalanja , `` but some wag must have done it . '' 
`` True , '' said Babbalanja . 
asked Media , drawing himself up in his robe , and cocking his crown . 
And so saying , irreverently grasping his sacred arm , they conducted us toward a lofty structure , planted upon a bold hill , and supported by thirty pillars of palm ; four quite green ; as if recently added ; and beyond these , an almost interminable vacancy , as if all the palms in Mardi , were at some future time , to aid in upholding that fabric . 
`` By my right hand , Saturnina , '' cried Babbalanja , `` but thou wert made in the image of thy Maker ! 
Aswe lingered in the precincts of the temple after all others had departed , sundry comments were made upon what we had seen ; and having remarked the hostility of the lunatic orator toward Dominora , Babbalanja thus addressed Media : -- `` My lord , I am constrained to believe , that all Vivenza can not be of the same mind with the grandiloquent chief from Hio-Hio . 
`` There 's not so much freedom here as these freemen think , '' said Babbalanja , turning ; `` I laugh and admire . '' 
Overhearing these shouts , Babbalanja thus addressed Media : -- `` My lord , I can not but believe , that these men , are far more excited than those with whom they so ardently sympathize . 
So also with Babbalanja . 
`` My lord , I am amazed at the indiscretion of a demi-god , '' said Babbalanja , as we passed on our way ; `` I recognized your sultanic style the very first sentence . 
Now , could it have been Babbalanja ? 
For , philosophic as the document was , it seemed too dogmatic and conservative for him . 
asked Babbalanja . 
Heeding him not , Babbalanja advanced toward the foremost of those with the thongs , -- one Nulli : a cadaverous , ghost-like man ; with a low ridge of forehead ; hair , steel-gray ; and wondrous eyes ; -- bright , nimble , as the twin Corposant balls , playing about the ends of ships ' royal-yards in gales . 
The sun passed under a cloud ; and Nulli , darting at Babbalanja those wondrous eyes , there fell upon him a baleful glare . 
`` What art thou , '' said Babbalanja to the serf . 
cried Babbalanja ; `` and are their souls , then , blown out as candles ? '' 
`` Frost never weeps , '' said Babbalanja ; `` and tears are frozen in those frigid eyes . '' 
cried Babbalanja ; `` and doth this thing exist ? 
`` Yet charge it not upon all Vivenza , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` And therein , Babbalanja , is involved one of those anomalies in the condition of Vivenza , '' said Media , `` which I can hardly comprehend . 
`` Pray , Babbalanja put all three questions together ; and then , do what you have often done before , -- pronounce yourself a lunatic . '' 
`` Do you take me for a mere man , then , Babbalanja , that you talk to me thus ? '' 
So , Babbalanja ! 
Sometimes they slay us , Babbalanja ; pour out our marrow , as I this wine ; but they spill no kinless blood . 
`` If here , '' said Babbalanja , `` Yillah will not stay our coming , but fly before us through the groves . 
cried Babbalanja . 
Said Babbalanja , bowing to the blast : `` Thus , oh Vivenza ! 
`` How vain to say , that progress is the test of truth , my lord , '' said Babbalanja , `` when , after many centuries , those crescents yet unwaning shine , and count a devotee for every worshiper of yonder crosses . 
`` Granite continents , '' cried Babbalanja , `` that seem created like the planets , not built with human hands . 
`` Tingling is the test , '' said Babbalanja , `` Yoomy , did you tingle , when that song was composing ? '' 
`` All over , Babbalanja . '' 
`` Not more so , than sincere , '' said Babbalanja . 
in a low , mild tenor , he begins : -- `` Proceed , gentle Yoomy , '' said Babbalanja . 
cried Babbalanja . 
sighed Babbalanja , turning ; `` how little they ween of the Rudimental Quincunxes , and the Hecatic Spherula ! '' 
While delighted , all our paddlers gazed , Media , observing Babbalanja plunged in reveries , called upon him to awake ; asking what might so absorb him . 
The lagoon was calm , as we landed ; not a breath stirred the plumes of the trees ; and as we entered the voiceless shades , lifting his hand , Babbalanja whispered : -- `` This silence is a fit introduction to the portals of Telestic lore . 
From the voices of the party , the sage must have been aware of our approach : but seated on a green bank , beneath the shade of a red mulberry , upon the boughs of which , many an owl was perched , he seemed intent upon describing divers figures in the air , with a jet-black wand . 
Advancing with much deference and humility , Babbalanja saluted him . 
`` Still posed , Babbalanja ? '' 
persisted Mohi ; while Babbalanja , arms folded , stood serious and mute ; a sneer on his lip . 
`` So called from the syllogist himself , doubtless ; '' said Mohi , stroking his beard . 
cried Babbalanja . 
`` Bravely done , Babbalanja ! '' 
Sailing on , with open eyes , we slept the wakeful sleep of those , who to the body only give repose , while the spirit still toils on , threading her mountain passes . 
`` A very royal and imperial dream , '' said Babbalanja -- `` he is arraigning me before high heaven ; -- ay , ay ; in dreams , at least , he deems himself a demi-god . '' 
`` His dream has changed , '' said Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja , speak -- Mohi ! 
`` We dream not ourselves , '' said Babbalanja , `` but the thing within us . '' 
inquired Babbalanja . 
But in courtly phrase , as beseemed him , Babbalanja , turban in hand , thus spoke : -- `` My concern is extreme , King Yoky , at the embarrassment into which your island is thrown . 
But Babbalanja , quoting the old proverb -- `` Strike me in the face , but refuse not my yams , '' induced him to sacrifice his fastidiousness . 
`` Now , '' said Babbalanja , lighting his trombone as we sailed from the isle , `` who are the monsters , we or the cripples ? '' 
`` Cease , cease , Babbalanja , '' said Media , `` and permit me to insinuate a word in your ear . 
Fortwenty-four hours , seated stiff , and motionless , Babbalanja spoke not a word ; then , almost without moving a muscle , muttered thus : -- `` At banquets surfeit not , but fill ; partake , and retire ; and eat not again till you crave . 
`` Art resuscitated , then , Babbalanja ? '' 
`` How now , Babbalanja ? '' 
said Media , `` Bardianna , Azzageddi , or Babbalanja ? '' 
`` And fools like me drink till they reel , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Mine , my lord , has long been fixed , '' said Babbalanja . 
rumbled Babbalanja . 
`` Babbalanja , that 's an extraordinary document , '' said Media . 
`` According to the best accounts , how did he depart , Babbalanja ? '' 
`` Nay , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Flying death , they ran to meet it , '' said Babbalanja . 
But none the less does Babbalanja quake . 
And if he flies not , 't is because he stands the center of a circle ; its every point a leveled dart ; and every bow , bent back : -- a twang , and Babbalanja dies . '' 
answered Babbalanja . 
said Babbalanja . 
Yet none he lifteth up . '' 
Vee-Vee 's horn was sonorous ; and issuing from his golden groves , my lord Abrazza , like a host that greets you on the threshold , met us , as we keeled the beach . 
So on the grass we lounged ; and King Abrazza , who loved his antique ancestors ; and loved old times ; and would not talk of moderns ; -- bade Yoomy sing old songs ; bade Mohi rehearse old histories ; bade Babbalanja tell of old ontologies ; and commanded all , meanwhile , to drink his old , old wine . 
Babbalanja . 
Vavona himself was blind ; when , in the silence of his secret bower , he said -- `` I will build another world . 
Babbalanja . 
-- You seem to know all authors : -- you must have heard of Lombardo , Babbalanja ; he who flourished many ages since . 
Babbalanja . 
-- I have ; and his grand Koztanza know by heart . 
But , Babbalanja , if Lombardo had aught to tell to Mardi -- why choose a vehicle so crazy ? 
Babbalanja . 
-- It was his nature , I suppose . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja , are you acquainted with the history of Lombardo ? 
Babbalanja . 
All his biographies have I read . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
You were talking of Lombardo , Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja -LRB- bowing -RRB- . 
But come , Babbalanja , hast forgotten all about Lombardo ? 
-- Oh , for all the ravings of your Babbalanja , Lombardo took no special pains ; hence , deserves small commendation . 
Babbalanja . 
-- No , your Highness ; but like eagles , his thoughts were first callow ; yet , born plumeless , they came to soar . 
I presume , Babbalanja , the first thing he did , was to fast , and invoke the muses . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Pardon , my lord ; on the contrary he first procured a ream of vellum , and some sturdy quills : indispensable preliminaries , my worshipful lords , to the writing of the sublimest epics . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He never dashed off aught . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He read them over attentively ; made a neat package of the whole : and put it into the fire . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
-- No , your Highness ; though he loved it , no wine for Lombardo while actually at work . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Not so ; he had another way of keeping himself well braced . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He never wrote by rush-light . 
His lamp swung in heaven . 
-- He rose from his East , with the sun ; he wrote when all nature was alive . 
-- Doubtless , then , he always wrote with a grin ; and none laughed louder at his quips , that Lombardo himself . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
-- His merriment was not always merriment to him , your Highness . 
For the most part , his meaning kept him serious . 
Then he was so intensely riveted to his work , he could not pause to laugh . 
-- My word for it ; but he had a sly one , now and then . 
Babbalanja . 
-- For the nonce , he was not his own master : a mere amanuensis writing by dictation . 
Babbalanja . 
-- But pray , Babbalanja , tell us how he made acquaintance with some of those rare worthies , he introduces us to , in his Koztanza . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He first met them in his reveries ; they were walking about in him , sour and moody : and for a long time , were shy of his advances ; but still importuned , they at last grew ashamed of their reserve ; stepped forward ; and gave him their hands . 
-- But , Babbalanja ; after all , the Koztanza found no favor in the eyes of some Mardians . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Yes : on good authority , Verbi is said to have detected a superfluous comma ; and Batho declared that , with the materials he could have constructed a far better world than Lombardo 's . 
-- But the unities ; Babbalanja , the unities ! 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
But Babbalanja , the Koztanza lacks cohesion ; it is wild , un-connected , all episode . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Now , Babbalanja , away with your tropes ; and tell us of the work , directly it was done . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Yes , to Zenzori ; who asked him where he picked up so much trash ; to Hanto , who bade him not be cast down , it was pretty good ; to Lucree , who desired to know how much he was going to get for it ; to Roddi , who offered a suggestion . 
Babbalanja . 
-- That he had best make a faggot of the whole ; and try again . 
Babbalanja . 
-- To Pollo ; who , conscious his opinion was sought , was thereby puffed up ; and marking the faltering of Lombardo 's voice , when the manuscript was handed him , straightway concluded , that the man who stood thus trembling at the bar , must needs be inferior to the judge . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
Taking home his manuscript , he glanced it over ; making three corrections . 
Babbalanja . 
-- Then , your Highness , he thought to try a conclave of professional critics ; saying to himself , `` Let them privately point out to me , now , all my blemishes ; so that , what time they come to review me in public , all will be well . '' 
Babbalanja . 
-- Oro help the victim that falls in Babbalanja 's hands ! 
Babbalanja . 
-- `` For this thing , '' said he , `` I have agonized over it enough . 
That 's the load , self-imposed , under which Babbalanja reels . 
Babbalanja . 
Sometimes , when by himself , he thought hugely of it , as my lord Abrazza says ; but when abroad , among men , he almost despised it ; but when he bethought him of those parts , written with full eyes , half blinded ; temples throbbing ; and pain at the heart -- Abrazza . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He would say to himself , `` Sure , it can not be in vain ! '' 
Yet again , when he bethought him of the hurry and bustle of Mardi , dejection stole over him . 
`` Who will heed it , '' thought he ; `` what care these fops and brawlers for me ? 
Babbalanja . 
But , prithee , Babbalanja , proceed . 
Babbalanja . 
Babbalanja . 
-- He himself best knew what he thought ; but , like all others , he was created by Oro to some special end ; doubtless , partly answered in his Koztanza . 
Babbalanja ! 
Babbalanja -LRB- looking upward -RRB- . 
Mohi -LRB- stroking his beard -RRB- . 
Babbalanja -LRB- starting up -RRB- . 
Babbalanja ! 
But as yet , Babbalanja joined not in the revels . 
His mood was on him ; and apart he sat ; silently eyeing the banquet ; and ever and anon muttering , -- `` Fogle-foggle , fugle-fi -- '' The first fury of the feast over , said King Media , pouring out from a heavy flagon into his goblet , `` Abrazza , these suppers are wondrous fine things . '' 
`` High and royal authority , that of Ludwig the Fat , '' said Babbalanja , `` far higher than the authority of Ludwig the Great : -- the one , only great by courtesy ; the other , fat beyond a peradventure . 
`` Well , then , your Highness , of all the eighteen royal Ludwigs of Franko -- '' `` Who like so many ten-pins , all in a row , '' interposed Babbalanja -- `` have been bowled off the course by grim Death . '' 
`` Yea , '' said Babbalanja , `` a very round sun was Ludwig the Fat . 
I command it , drink , Babbalanja ! '' 
-- Do as you please Babbalanja . '' 
`` But my good lords , '' said Babbalanja , now brightening with wine ; `` if , of all suppers those given by bachelors be the best : -- of all bachelors , are not your priests and monks the jolliest ? 
`` Bravo , Babbalanja ! '' 
`` Ay , '' continued Babbalanja , `` bachelors are a noble fraternity : I 'm a bachelor myself . 
`` See , my lord , what yours has done for Babbalanja . 
`` Ay , my lord demi-gods , '' said Babbalanja , drop by drop refilling his goblet . 
`` Let not Azzageddi get uppermost again , Babbalanja , '' cried Media . 
murmured Babbalanja , holding his full goblet at arm 's length on the board , `` not thus with the hapless wight , born with a hamper on his back , and blisters in his palms . 
I crave pardon , King Abrazza , but no violence must be done Babbalanja . '' 
`` Take Azzageddi 's also , '' said Babbalanja ; `` and say , I hope his Highness will not fail in his appointment with me : -- the first midnight after he dies ; at the grave-yard corner ; -- there I 'll be , and grin again ! '' 
`` Peopled but not enlivened , '' said Babbalanja . 
`` Then we have circled not the round reef wholly , '' said Babbalanja , `` but made of it a segment . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` My lord , '' said Babbalanja ; `` still must we shun the unmitigated evil ; and only view the good ; or evil so mixed therewith , the mixture 's both ? '' 
Babbalanja ! 
then for one , I am with you ; '' cried Babbalanja . 
`` Five hundred thousand centuries since , '' said Babbalanja , `` this same sight was seen . 
`` Babbalanja ! 
Babbalanja ! 
`` Mark the agony in his waning eye , '' said Yoomy ; -- `` alas , poor Babbalanja ! 
by this , thy being 's side , I kneel : -- grant death or happiness to Babbalanja ! '' 
`` Ay , gone , '' said Babbalanja , `` and whither ? 
`` To me , '' said Mohi , his gray locks damp with night-dews , `` death 's dark defile at times seems at hand , with no voice to cheer . 
Babbalanja says truth . 
said Babbalanja . 
`` More valiant dying , than dead , '' said Babbalanja . 
Anon , lifting his head , Babbalanja thus : -- `` Yillah still eludes us . 
`` No coward he , who hunted , turns and finds no foe to fight , '' said Babbalanja . 
Day dawned ; and from his golden vases poured red wine upon the waters . 
`` The storm we have survived , old man ; and many more , we yet must ride , '' said Babbalanja . 
said Babbalanja ; `` methinks Serenia is that land of enthusiasts , of which we hear , my lord ; where Mardians pretend to the unnatural conjunction of reason with things revealed ; where Alma , they say , is restored to his divine original ; where , deriving their principles from the same sources whence flow the persecutions of Maramma , -- men strive to live together in gentle bonds of peace and charity ; -- folly ! 
`` No , no , '' said Babbalanja ; `` old man ! 
`` But , '' said Babbalanja , `` since Alma , they say , was solely intent upon the things of the Mardi to come -- which to all , must seem uncertain -- of what benefit his precepts for the daily lives led here ? '' 
`` Fine poetry all this , '' said Babbalanja , `` but not so new . 
`` No , no , '' said Babbalanja , `` as an intruder he came ; and an intruder would he be this day . 
murmured Babbalanja . 
`` No temples , then no priests ; '' said Babbalanja , `` for few priests will enter where lordly arches form not the portal . '' 
murmured Babbalanja . 
cried Babbalanja , sinking on his knees -- `` in thee , at last , I find repose . 
Returning , we espied Babbalanja advancing in his snowwhite mantle . 
The fiery tide was ebbing ; and in the soft , moist sand , at every step , he left a lustrous foot-print . 
this isle is full of mysteries , '' he said . 
Babbalanja thus : -- `` My voyage is ended . 
And from the beach , he wended through the woods .
