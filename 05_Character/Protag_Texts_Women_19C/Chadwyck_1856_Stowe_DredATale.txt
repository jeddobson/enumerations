`` Yes , Miss Nina , beautiful -- but -- '' `` O , those bills ! 
He looked at the little , defiant fay for a moment with an air of the most entire deference and admiration ; then a heavy shadow crossed his face , and he answered , abstractedly , `` Yes , Miss Nina , everything you wear becomes pretty -- and that is perfectly charming . '' 
`` Engaged , Miss Nina ? '' 
`` It seems to me that 's a very serious thing , Miss Nina . '' 
`` But , is this true , Miss Nina ? 
`` Engaged to three gentlemen , Miss Nina ? '' 
`` Miss Nina , is that right ? '' 
`` Pray , Miss Nina , tell us who they are . '' 
`` And are you corresponding with all these lovers , Miss Nina ? '' 
`` Miss Nina , I think you have given your heart to this last one . '' 
`` Miss Nina , you must excuse me , but I want to ask again , is it right to trifle with the feelings of gentlemen in this way ? '' 
`` Miss Nina , what if all three of them should come at once -- or even two of them ? '' 
`` Now , Miss Nina , I want to speak as a friend . '' 
`` Miss Nina , these do not appear to be bills . '' 
`` Pray , tell us about it , Miss Nina , '' said the young man , with his eyes fixed admiringly on the little person , while he was smoothing and arranging the crumpled documents . 
So he put on that very edifying air of his , and said , ` Miss Nina , I trust , as your friend , that you will not read that book . 
said I. ``` Yes , Miss Nina , ' said he , quite piously . 
`` Miss Nina , I should think you would be afraid to express yourself so positively . '' 
`` Yes , but , Miss Nina , some time or other you must marry somebody . 
`` I did n't presume to comment , Miss Nina . 
You never saw anything like her ! 
She puts down things I never got , I know she does . 
Nothing in the world but because she is from Paris . 
Everybody is complaining of her . 
`` O , Miss Nina , on my knees I beg pardon ! '' 
I am positively delighted to hear of your economy , Miss Nina . '' 
You can see the dyer 's bill , there ; and Mme. Carteau told me she always expected to turn my dresses twice , at least . 
`` I have heard of old dresses turned costing more than new ones , Miss Nina . '' 
`` Miss Nina , you are too kind . '' 
`` I do , do n't I , Miss Nina ? '' 
`` For servants , Miss Nina , your papa said , I suppose . '' 
With the quick tact of her sex , Nina perceived that she had struck some disagreeable chord in the mind of her faithful attendant , and she hastened to change the subject , in her careless , rattling way . 
Why , then , had Clayton , who always unreservedly corresponded with his sister , not kept her apprised of his gradual attachment to Nina ? 
The secret of the matter was , that he had had an instinctive consciousness that he could not present Nina to the practical , clear-judging mind of his sister , as she appeared through the mist and spray of his imaginative nature . 
`` Well , but , my dear , Nina is n't a woman ; she is a child -- a gay , beautiful , unformed child ; and I 'm sure you may apply to her what Pope says : `` Yes , indeed , '' said Anne , `` I believe all you men are alike -- a pretty face bewitches any of you . 
But it is not every person whom I canidealize ; and I suspect this is the great reason why I never could love some very fine women , with whom I have associated on intimate terms ; they had no capacity of being idealized ; they could receive no color from my fancy ; they wanted , in short , just what Nina has . 
She is just like one of those little whisking , chattering cascades in the White Mountains , and the atmosphere round her is favorable to rainbows . '' 
`` And you always see her through them . '' 
Now , I do n't think Nina capable of trifling with a real , deep , unselfish attachment -- a love which sought her good , and was willing to sacrifice itself for her ; but I do n't believe any such has ever been put at her disposal . 
Nina has grown up an heiress among servants , a boarding-school girl in New York ; and , furthermore , you are twenty-seven and she is eighteen , and a great deal may be learned between eighteen and twenty-seven . '' 
Now , Nina has just that difference from me which chords with me ; and all our little quarrels -- for we have had a good many , and I dare say shall have more -- are only a sort of chromatic passages , -- discords of the seventh , leading into harmony . 
The vivacity and acuteness of her outer life makes her just what I need . 
She wakens , she rouses , and keeps me in play ; and her quick instincts are often more than a match for my reason . 
I reverence the child , then , in spite of her faults . 
She has taught me many things . '' 
Nina , I know , will love you ; and , if you never tryto advise her and influence her , you will influence her very much . 
When I first knew Nina , I was silly enough to try my hand that way , myself ; but I 've learned better . 
Now , when Nina comes to us , all that you and mamma have got to do is just to be kind to her , and liveas you always have lived ; and whatever needs to be altered in her , she will alter herself . '' 
`` Well , '' said Anne , `` I wish , as it is so , that I could see her . '' 
`` Suppose you write a few lines to her in this letter that I am going to write ; and then that will lead in due time to a visit . '' 
Our reader has seen what Nina was on her return from New York , and can easily imagine that she had no idea of embracing , in good earnest , the hard duties of such a life . 
In fact , since the death of Nina 's mother , the situation of the mistress of the family had been only nominally filled by her aunt , Mrs. Nesbit . 
The real housekeeper , in fact , was an old mulatto woman , named Katy , who had been trained by Nina 's mother . 
Nina 's mother , being always in delicate health , had , from necessity , been obliged to commit much responsibility to `` Aunt Katy , '' as she was called ; and she had grown up under the discipline into a very efficient housekeeper . 
Indeed , had Nina chosen to demur , her prime minister had the power , without departing in the slightest degree from a respectful bearing , to involve her in labyrinths of perplexity without end . 
And , as Nina hated trouble , and wanted , above all things , to have her time to herself for her own amusement , she wisely concluded not to interfere with Aunt Katy 's reign , and to get by persuasion and coaxing , what the old body would have been far too consequential and opinionated to give to authority . 
During the time , however , of Nina 's father , and still more after his death , there appeared evidently on the place signs of that gradual decay which has conducted many an old Virginian family to poverty and ruin . 
He therefore resolved to leave him bound by an indissoluble tie for a term of years , trusting to his attachment to Nina to make this service tolerable . 
From childhood , it was his habit to vex and annoy her in every possible way ; and it was for this reason , among many others , that Harry had persuaded Mr. John Gordon , Nina 's uncle and guardian , to place her at the New York boarding-school , where she acquired what is termed an education . 
After finishing her school career , she had been spending a few months in a family of a cousin of her mother 's , and running with loose rein the career of fashionable gayety . 
Luckily , she brought home with her unspoiled a genuine love of nature , which made the rural habits of plantation life agreeable to her . 
Her uncle 's plantation , five miles distant , was the nearest . 
It was Nina 's delight , however , in her muslin wrapper , and straw hat , to patter about over the plantation , to chat with the negroes among their cabins , amusing herself with the various drolleries and peculiarities to which long absence had given the zest of novelty . 
Then she would call for her pony , and , attended by Harry , or some of her servants , would career through the woods , gathering the wild-flowers with which they abound ; perhaps stop for a day at her uncle 's , have a chat and a romp with him , and return the next morning . 
In the comparative solitude of her present life her mind began to clear itself of some former follies , as water when at rest deposits the sediment which clouded it . 
Apart from the crowd , and the world of gayeties which had dizzied her , she could not help admitting to herself the folly of much she had been doing . 
So Nina , in her positive and off-hand way , sat down , one day , and wrote farewell letters to both her other lovers , and felt herself quite relieved by the process . 
A young person could scarce stand more entirely alone , as to sympathetic intercourse with relations , than Nina . 
It is true that the presence of her mother 's sister in the family caused it to be said that she was residing under the care of an aunt . 
Of course , Mrs. Nesbit regarded Nina , and all other lively young people , with a kind of melancholy endurance -- as shocking spectacles of worldliness . 
There was but little sympathy , to be sure , between the dashing , and out-spoken , and almost defiant little Nina , and the sombre silver-gray apparition which glided quietly about the wide halls of her paternal mansion . 
In fact , it seemed to afford the latter a mischievous pleasure to shock her respectable relative on all convenient occasions . 
The bed , arranged with extremest precision , however , was covered with a melange of French finery , flounces , laces , among which Nina kept up a continual agitation like that produced by a breeze in a flower-bed , as she unfolded , turned , and fluttered them , before the eyes of her relative . 
`` I have been through all this , Nina , '' said the latter , with a melancholy shake of her head , `` and I know the vanity of it . '' 
`` O , here comes Tomtit , '' said Nina ; `` now for a scene ! 
His true name was no less respectable and methodical than that of Thomas ; but , as he was one of those restless and effervescent sprites , who seem to be born for the confusion of quiet people , Nina had rechristened him Tomtit , which sobriquet was immediately recognized by the whole household as being eminently descriptive and appropriate . 
`` Good law , Miss Nina , whar on earth dese yer come from ? 
Nina , you ought not to allow that ; it just encourages him ! '' 
said Nina , laughing . 
Now , I 's a studdin on dat dare most all de morning -- was so , '' said he , gathering confidence , as he saw , by Nina 's dancing eyes , how greatly she was amused . 
Nina was so completely overcome by this novel application of the text which she had heard her aunt laboriously drumming into Tomtit , the Sabbath before , that she laughed aloud , with rather uproarious merriment . 
`` No , I does n't know nothing , Miss Nina , '' said Tomtit , at the same time looking out from under his long eyelashes . 
`` Law , missis , come up here to bring Miss Nina 's love-letters , '' said he , producing two or three letters . 
and , before a word could be said , he was out of the room and down stairs , and at the height of furious contest with the girl who was cleaning the silver , for a waiter to put Miss Nina 's letters on . 
`` Dar , Miss Nina , '' appealing to her when she appeared , `` Rosa wo n't let me have no waity ! '' 
said Nina , seizing the letters from his hands , and laughing while she cuffed his ears . 
`` Well , '' said Tomtit , looking after her with great solemnity , `` missis in de right on ` t. A n't no kind of order in this here house , ` pite of all I can do . 
And , finally , Miss Nina , she pull them all away . 
There was one member of Nina 's establishment of a character so marked that we can not refrain from giving her a separate place in our picture of her surroundings , -- and this was Milly , the waiting-woman of Aunt Nesbit . 
Miss Nina brought it , when she came home , last week . '' 
Is n't she a beauty ? 
Is n't she good ? 
`` And , now , do tell me , '' said Lisette , `` all about Miss Nina . 
How does she look ? '' 
`` Just the same witchy , wilful ways with her . '' 
`` And did she show you her dresses ? '' 
Say , Harry , do n't you suppose she will let me come and look at her things ? '' 
`` O , yes , dear , I do n't doubt she will ; and that will save my making a gazette of myself . '' 
You ca n't guess , now , what Miss Nina brought for me . '' 
`` Miss Nina is a dear , good little mistress , but she does n't know anything about accounts , or money ; and here she has brought me home a set of bills to settle , and I 'm sure I do n't know where the money is to be got from . 
Things ca n't be done now as some other families would do them ; and , then , those bills which Miss Nina brings from New York are perfectly frightful . '' 
Now , there 's Miss Nina ; she is engaged , she tells me , to two or three lovers , as usual . '' 
`` Engaged , is she ? '' 
said Lisette , eagerly , female curiosity getting the better of every other consideration ; `` she always did have lovers , just , you know , as I used to . '' 
And what makes me feel the most anxious is , that I 'm pretty sure Miss Nina will marry one of these lovers before long . '' 
Miss Nina little knows , when she is rattling about her beaux , what I 'm thinking of . 
`` But , certainly , Harry , Miss Nina will never consent to such a thing . '' 
`` Lisette , Miss Nina is one thing , but Mrs. Clayton may be quite another thing . 
The more Miss Nina has liked me , the less her husband may like me ; do n't you know that ? '' 
`` Well , then , Harry , if you feel so bad about it , what makes you pay this money for Miss Nina ? 
She do n't know anything about it ; she do n't ask you to . 
I do n't believe she would want you to , if she did know it . 
Why do n't you tell her all about it ? '' 
And , as for Miss Nina , she is n't selfish -- she is only inconsiderate . 
But I 've known her do for him , over and over , just what I do for her , giving him her money and her jewels to help him out of a scrape . 
I never told Miss Nina ; I would n't have her told for the world . 
It would n't make her love me ; more likely it would turn her against me . 
I was given to her , and my sister and my mother went out to Mississippi with Miss Nina 's aunt . '' 
But , now , as to Miss Nina 's estate , you do n't know how I feel about it . 
I was trusted with it , and trusted with her . 
She never has known , more than a child , where the money came from , or went to ; and it sha n't be said that I 've brought the estate in debt , for the sake of getting my own liberty . 
If I have one pride in life , it is to give it up to Miss Nina 's husband in good order . 
I feel in my very heart that I 'm like Colonel Gordon -- I know I am ; and , sometimes , I know I look like him , and that 's one reason why Tom Gordon always hated me ; and , then , there 's another thing , the hardest of all , to have a sister like Miss Nina , to feel she ismy sister , and never dare to say a word of it ! 
She little thinks , when she plays and jokes with me , sometimes , hew I feel . 
And yet he must have all the position , and all the respect ; and , then , Miss Nina so often says to me , by way of apology , when she puts up with his ugliness , ` Ah ! 
Miss Nina was his pet . 
He was wholly absorbed in her , and he was frightened at Tom 's wickedness ; and so he left me bound to the estate in this way , only stipulating that I should buy myself on favorable terms before Miss Nina 's marriage . 
She has always been willing enough . 
I might have taken any and every advantage of her inconsiderateness . 
And Mr. John Gordon has been willing , too , and has been very kind about it , and has signed an agreement as guardian , and Miss Nina has signed it too , that , in case of her death , or whatever happened , I 'm to have my freedom on paying a certain sum , and I have got his receipts for what I have paid . 
`` Miss Nina sent me . 
She wants you to get on dat ar horse , and make tracks for home like split foot . 
She done got letters from two or three of her beaux , and she is dancing and tearing round there real awful . 
She done got scared , spects ; feard they 'd all come together . '' 
`` And she sent you on a message , and you have n't told me , all this time ! '' 
`` No , he wo n't , either , '' cried Lisette , laughing . 
Nina , after taking her letters from the hands of Tomtit , as we have related , ran back with them into Mrs. Nesbit 's room , and sat herself down to read them . 
`` Your and my notions of propriety , Nina , are so different , that I do n't know how to advise you . 
There was a long pause , in which Nina sat vexed and coloring , biting her lips , and nestling uneasily in her seat . 
Mrs. Nesbit looked calm and considerate , and Nina began to hope that she was taking the case a little to heart . 
Nina thought she was debating the expediency of sending some message ; and therefore she crossed the room with great alacrity , to look at the old clock in the entry . 
and she stood , with her lips apart , looking at Mrs. Nesbit for some suggestion . 
Nina actually stamped with anger . 
`` Nina , child , you astonish me ! '' 
said Aunt Nesbit , with her wonted placidity . 
said Nina , `` I do n't care a bit ! 
said her aunt . 
Should n't give way to this temper , Nina ; it 's very unladylike , besides being sinful . 
And Aunt Nesbit , with an abused air , got up , walked quietly to the looking-glass , took off her morning cap , unlocked her drawer , and laid it in ; took out another , which Nina could not see differed a particle from the last , held it up thoughtfully on her hand , and appeared absorbed in the contemplation of it , -- while Nina , swelling with a mixture of anger and mortification , stood regarding her as she leisurely picked out each bow , and finally , with a decorous air of solemnity , arranged it upon her head , patting it tenderly down . 
`` Aunt Nesbit , '' she said , suddenly , as if the words hurt her , `` I think I spoke improperly , and I 'm very sorry for it . 
Bang went the door , and in a moment Nina stood in the entry , shaking her fist at it with impotent wrath . 
The first object that she saw was Milly , arranging some clothes in her drawer ; and , to her astonishment , Nina rushed up to her , and , throwing her arms round her neck , sobbed and wept , in such tumultuous excitement , that the good creature was alarmed . 
And , at each word of endearment , Nina 's distress broke out afresh , and she sobbed so bitterly that the faithful creature really began to be frightened . 
`` Laws , Miss Nina , I hope there a n't nothing happened to you now ! '' 
she said , with a fresh burst . 
said Milly , compassionately , sitting down , and fondling Nina in her arms , as if she had been a babe . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , speaking between her sobs , `` the girls at school had mothers . 
`` The worst of it is , '' said Nina , `` when Aunt Nesbit speaks to me in her hateful way , I get angry ; then I speak in a way that is n't proper , I know . 
`` Ah , Miss Nina , we must n't spect more of folks than there is in them . '' 
said Nina ; `` she never did anything for anybody else with a will ! 
`` O laws , now , Miss Nina , you 's too hard on her . 
Why , look how patient she sits with Tomtit , teaching him his hymns and varses . '' 
`` And you think that 's because she cares anything about him ? 
Do you know she thinks he is n't fit to go to heaven , and that if he dies he ' ll go to the bad place . 
And yet , if he was to die to-morrow , she 'd talk to you about clear-starching her caps ! 
No wonder the child do n't love her ! 
She talks to him just as she does to me ; tells him she do n't expect anything of him -- she knows he 'll never come to any good ; and the little wretch has got it by heart , now . 
Do you know that , though I get in a passion with Tom , sometimes , and though I 'm sure I should perish sitting boring with him over those old books , yet I really believe I care more for him than she does ? 
He sees through her as plain as I do . 
I know there is such a thing as religion ; but she has n't got it . 
She is just as worldly-minded as I am , only it 's in another way . 
There , now , I wanted her to advise me about something , to-day . 
`` Well , now , Miss Nina , ` pears though you 've talked enough about dat ar ; ` pears like it wo n't make you feel no better . '' 
`` He is gone over to see his wife , I think , Miss Nina . '' 
`` Miss Nina , '' said Milly , looking hesitatingly , `` I ` spect you do n't know how things go about round here ; but the fact is , Old Hundred has got so kind of cur ` ous , lately , there ca n't nobody do nothing with him , except Harry . 
And Nina , quite restored to her usual good-humor , tripped gayly across to the cabin of Old Hundred , that stood the other side of the house . 
Utterly ignorant , however , of the magnitude of the undertaking which she was attempting , and buoyant with the consciousness of authority , Nina tripped singing along , and found Old Hundred tranquilly reclining in his tent-door , watching through his half-shut eyes , while the afternoon sunbeam irradiated the smoke which rose from the old pipe between his teeth . 
A large , black , one-eyed crow sat perching , with a quizzical air , upon his knee ; and when he heard Nina 's footsteps approaching , cocked his remaining eye towards her , with a smart , observing attitude , as if he had been deputed to look out for applications while his master dozed . 
`` Uncle John , '' said Nina , `` I want you to get the carriage out for me , right away . 
Why , bless your soul , Miss Nina , de curtains is all off de carriage ! '' 
`` Ah , Miss Nina , dat ar a n't all . 
Why , Miss Nina , he was dat sick I had to be up with him most all night ! '' 
And , while Old Hundred thus adroitly issued this little work of fiction , the raven nodded waggishly at Nina , as much as to say , `` You hear that fellow , now ! '' 
Nina stood quite perplexed , biting her lips , and Old Hundred seemed to go into a profound slumber . 
Laws , Miss Nina , your pa used to say to me , says he , ` Uncle John , you knows more about dem critturs dan I do ; and , now I tell you what it is , Uncle John -- you take care of dem critturs ; do n't you let nobody kill 'em for nothing . ' 
Now , Miss Nina , I 's always a walking in the steps of the colonel 's ` rections . 
Tell you , Miss Nina ; why don ' you let Harry carry your letter over ? 
`` The short of the matter is , Uncle John , you are determined not to go , '' said Nina . 
Old Hundred still sat quiet , smoking ; and Nina , after reiterating her orders till she got thoroughly angry , began , at last , to ask herself the question , how she was going to carry them into execution . 
Old Hundred appeared to have descended into himself in a profound revery , and betrayed not the smallest sign of hearing anything she said . 
`` I wish Harry would come back quick , '' she said to herself , as she pensively retraced her steps through the garden ; but Tomtit had taken the commission to go for him in his usual leisurely way , spending the greater part of the afternoon on the road . 
`` Well , Miss Nina , you recollect you said you thought it would be good fun . '' 
said Nina , catching at his sleeve as he was going out , `` come back again , wo n't you ? 
`` I have , Miss Nina ; but I ca n't flatter you too much . 
`` As to family , Miss Nina , '' said Harry , `` I think the Gordons can hold up their heads with anybody ; and , then , I rather think you 'll like Miss Clayton . '' 
`` Miss Nina , if you 'll let me speak my mind out frankly , now , I want to offer one piece of advice . 
You are a Gordon , and they say truth always runs in the Gordon blood ; and now , Miss Nina , you are no longer a school-girl , but a young lady at the head of the estate . '' 
Nina was not habitually an early riser , but on this morning she had awaked with the first peep of dawn , and , finding herself unable to go to sleep again , she had dressed herself , and gone down to the garden . 
She was walking up and down in one of the alleys , thinking over the perplexities of her own affairs , when her ear was caught by the wild and singular notes of one of those tunes commonly used among the slaves as dirges . 
The words `` She ar dead and gone to heaven '' seemed to come floating down upon her ; and , though the voice was cracked and strained , there was a sort of wildness and pathos in it , which made a singular impression in the perfect stillness of everything around her . 
She soon observed a singular-looking vehicle appearing in the avenue . 
This wagon , which was no other than the establishment of Cripps , drew Nina 's attention , and she went to the hedge to look at it . 
Tiff 's watchful eye immediately fell upon her , and , driving up to where she was standing , he climbed out upon the ground , and , lifting his hat , made her a profound obeisance , and `` hoped de young lady was bery well , dis morning . '' 
`` Yes , quite well , thank you , Uncle , '' said Nina , regarding him curiously . 
I like you better for it , '' said Nina . 
`` No , thank you , Miss Nina , I 's noways hungry . 
Lord , Miss Nina , I hope ye wo n't never know what ' t is to stand outside de gate , when de best friend you 've got 's gone in ; it 's hard , dat ar is ! '' 
And Nina ran into the house , while Tiff gazed mournfully after her . 
said Nina , meeting Milly in the entry , `` here you are . 
Well , I 'll ask Miss Loo if I may go -- or you ask her , Miss Nina . '' 
`` Aunt , '' said Nina , `` there 's a poor fellow , out here , whose mistress is just dead , all alone in the house , and wants to get some woman to go there to help . 
`` O , these low families do n't mind such things much , '' said Aunt Nesbit , fitting on her cap , quietly ; `` they never have much feeling . 
I do n't often ask favors , '' said Nina . 
And Nina pressed nearer , and actually seemed to overpower her slow-feeling , torpid relative , with the vehemence that sparkled in her eyes . 
said she , springing out the door . 
Theexcitement produced by the arrival of Tiff , and the fitting out of Milly to the cottage , had produced a most favorable diversion in Nina 's mind from her own especial perplexities . 
Active and buoyant , she threw herself at once into whatever happened to come uppermost on the tide of events . 
So , having seen the wagon despatched , she sat down to breakfast in high spirits . 
said Nina , whose graces always rapidly declined in controversies with her aunt , `` and so I shall do as I please . 
`` Well , I ca n't see , '' said Nina , `` how it 's their fault . 
`` They die of just such things as we do , '' said Nina . 
Nina 's nature was so vehement and imperious , when excited , that it was a disagreeable fatigue to cross her . 
Nina started up , hastily , on seeing her pony brought round to the door ; and , soon arrayed in her riding-dress , she was cantering through the pine woods in high spirits . 
And Harry was in attendance with her , mounted on another horse , and riding but a very little behind ; not so much so but what his mistress could , if she would , keep up a conversation with him . 
said Nina . 
`` Well , Miss Nina , you know how it is : everybody has his own work and business to attend to -- there are no schools for them to go to -- there 's no work for them to do . 
`` Well , I do n't know , Miss Nina ; that might be . 
You see , Miss Nina , when moneygoes , in this part of the country , everything goes with it ; and when a family is not rich enough to have everything in itself , it goes down very soon . '' 
`` At any rate , I pity the poor things , '' said Nina . 
Here Nina , observing the path clear and uninterrupted for some distance under the arching pines , struck her horse into a canter , and they rode on for some distance without speaking . 
The log-cabin which stood in the middle was far from having the appearance of wretchedness which Nina had expected . 
The whole air of the place was so unexpectedly inviting , in its sylvan stillness and beauty , that Nina could not help checking her horse , and exclaiming , `` I 'm sure , it 's a pretty place . 
She is none of your common sort of poor whites , Miss Nina . 
Just come in ; come in , and look at her . '' 
Nina stepped into the open door of the hut . 
Cripps made a stupid , staring inclination toward Nina and Harry , as they entered , and sat still , twirling his thumbs and muttering to himself . 
Tiff entered softly , and stood by Nina , as she gazed . 
`` She had a hard walk of it , '' he said , `` but she 's got home ! 
Do n't she look peaceful ? 
She stood with a fixed , tender thoughtfulness , unlike her usual gayety , her riding-hat hanging carelessly by its strings from her hands , her loose hair drooping over her face . 
She heard some one entering the cottage , but she did not look up . 
She was conscious of some one looking over her shoulder , and thought it was Harry . 
how young she looks , '' she said , `` to have had so much trouble ! '' 
Her voice trembled , and a tear stood in her eye . 
There was a sudden movement ; she looked up , and Clayton was standing by her . 
`` The poor thing died last night , '' said Nina . 
Harry , '' she said , walking softly towards the door , and speaking low , `` you provide a coffin ; have it made neatly . '' 
`` Uncle , '' she said , motioning Tiff towards her , `` where would they have her buried ? '' 
Laws , she 's so beautiful ! 
`` Indeed , Uncle , '' said Nina , tenderly , `` I 'm sorry I grieved you ; but you know , poor fellow , that must come . '' 
`` I 's known her ever since she 's dat high ! '' 
`` Her har was curly , and she used to war such pretty red shoes , and come running after me in de garden . 
` Tiff , Tiff , ' she used to say -- and dar she is now , and stroubles brought her dar ! 
Lord , what a pretty gal she was ! 
pretty as you be , Miss Nina . 
But since she married dat ar , '' pointing with his thumb over his shoulder , and speaking confidentially , `` everything went wrong . 
I 's held her up -- did all I could ; and now here she is ! '' 
`` Perhaps , '' said Nina , laying her hand on his , `` perhaps she 's in a better place than this . '' 
`` O , Lord , dat she is ! 
She told me dat when she died . 
She saw de Lord at last , -- she did so ! 
Dem 's her last words . 
` Tiff , ' she says , ` I see Him , and He will give me rest . 
Tiff , ' she says , -- I 'd been asleep , you know , and I kinder felt something cold on my hand , and I woke up right sudden , and dar she was , her eyes so bright , looking at me and breathing so hard ; and all she says was , ` Tiff , I 've seen Him , and I know now why I 've suffered so ; He 's gwine to take me , and give me rest ! ' '' 
`` Then , my poor fellow , you ought to rejoice that she is safe . '' 
`` Well , my good fellow , '' said Nina , `` we must leave you now . 
Then , drawing near to her , and sinking his voice , he said : ``` Bout de mourning , Miss Nina . 
`` Perhaps , Miss Nina , you can kind of touch it over . '' 
As for Nina , although the day before a thousand fancies and coquetries would have colored the manner of her meeting Clayton , yet now she was so impressed by what she had witnessed , that she scarcely appeared to know that she had met him . 
She placed her pretty foot on his hand , and let him lift her on to the saddle , scarcely noticing the act , except by a serious , graceful inclination of her head . 
Here Nina checked her horse ; and , pointing round the circle of pine forests , and up the stream , overhung with bending trees and branches , said : `` Hush ! 
she said . 
`` Remember what you said to the old man , Miss Nina . 
Perhaps she sees more beautiful things , now . '' 
I ca n't forget how cold her hand was ! 
In all the varying moods of Nina , Clayton had never seen anything that resembled this . 
But he understood the peculiar singleness and earnestness of nature which made any one idea , or impression , for a time absolute in her mind . 
said Nina . 
`` Do you know , '' said Nina , half checking her horse , suddenly , `` that I never had the least idea that these men were alive that we read about in these histories , or that they had any feelings like ours ? 
`` But , how strange it is , '' said Nina , `` to think that all those folks we read about are alive now , doing something somewhere ; and I get to wondering where they are -- Xerxes , and Alexander , and the rest of them . 
As she spoke , a pair of broad gates swung open , and they cantered in beneath the twilight arches of the oaks . 
As Clayton passed in , he took off his hat , as he had often done in foreign countries in cathedrals . 
said she , riding up to him , and looking up frankly into his face . 
The air , half queenly , half childish , with which this was said , was acknowledged by Clayton with a grave smile , as he replied , bowing , `` Thank you , madam . '' 
he replied . 
At this instant , a violent clamor , like the cawing of a crow , rose on one side of the avenue ; and the moment after , Tomtit appeared , caricoling , and cutting a somerset ; his curls flying , his cheeks glowing . 
said Nina . 
Nina felt herself blush to the roots of her hair , and was vexed and provoked to think she did so . 
Involuntarily her eyes met Clayton 's . 
But he expressed neither curiosity nor concern . 
said he . 
`` Yes ; it is very pretty , '' said Nina , abstractedly . 
Clayton , however , had noticed both the message and the blush , and was not so ill-informed as Nina supposed as to the whole affair , having heard from a New York correspondent of the probability that an arrival might appear upon the field about this time . 
And there Nina saw , plain enough , her Aunt Nesbit in all the proprieties of cap and silk gown , sitting , making the agreeable to Mr. Carson . 
Nina had liked his society extremely well in the drawing-rooms and opera-houses of New York . 
But , in the train of thought inspired by the lonely and secluded life she was now leading , it seemed to her an absolute impossibility that she could , even in coquetry and in sport , have allowed such an one to set up pretensions to her hand and heart . 
She was vexed with herself that she had done so , and therefore not in the most amiable mood for a meeting . 
Therefore , when , on ascending the steps , he rushed precipitately forward , and , offering his hand , called her Nina , she was ready to die with vexation . 
She observed , too , a peculiar swelling and rustling of Aunt Nesbit 's plumage , -- an indescribable air of tender satisfaction , peculiar to elderly ladies who are taking an interest in an affair of the heart , which led her to apprehend that the bachelor had commenced operations by declaring his position to her . ' 
T was with some embarrassment that Nina introduced Mr. Clayton , whom Aunt Nesbit received with a most stately curtsey , and Mr. Carson with a patronizing bow . 
`` Very warm riding , Nina , '' said Mr. Carson , observing her red cheeks . 
And Carson , drawing his chair close to Nina , asked , in a confidential under-tone , `` Who is that gentleman ? '' 
`` Mr. Clayton , of Claytonville , '' said Nina , with as much hauteur as she could assume . 
`` I beg , '' said Nina , rising , `` the gentlemen will excuse me a moment or two . '' 
Clayton replied by a grave bow , while Mr. Carson , with great empressement , handed Nina to the door . 
The moment it was closed , she stamped , with anger , in the entry . 
As if Nina 's cup were not yet full , Aunt Nesbit followed her to her chamber with an air of unusual graciousness . 
`` Nina , my dear , he has told me all about it ! 
said Nina . 
said Nina . 
Call me Nina , and talk as though he were lord paramount of me , and everything here ! 
`` Why , Nina ! 
`` But , my dear Nina , this trifling with gentlemen 's hearts ! '' 
Calling me ` Nina , ' indeed ! 
I 'll teach him to call me ` Nina ' ! 
`` But , Nina , you must confess you 've given him occasion for all this . '' 
`` Nina , how you talk ! '' 
`` O , that 's because you always dress in stone-color and drab , '' said Nina , as she stood brushing and arranging her curls . 
`` And who is this other gentleman , Nina ? '' 
`` Well , Nina , I 'll go down , and you make haste . '' 
In about half an hour Nina reäppeared in a flossy cloud of muslin , lace , and gauzy ribbons . 
Dress was one of those accomplishments for which the little gypsy had a natural instinct ; and , without any apparent thought , she always fell into that kind of color and material which harmonized with her style of appearance and character . 
There was always something floating and buoyant about the arrangement of her garments and drapery ; so that to see her move across the floor gave one an airy kind of sensation , like the gambols of thistle-down . 
Her brown eyes had a peculiar resemblance to a bird 's ; and this effect was increased by a twinkling motion of the head , and a fluttering habit of movement peculiar to herself ; so that when she swept by in rosy gauzes , and laid one ungloved hand lightly on the piano , she seemed to Clayton much like some saucy bird -- very good indeed if let alone , but ready to fly on the slightest approach . 
`` ` Pon my word , Nina , '' said Mr. Carson , coming towards her with a most delighted air , `` you look as if you had fallen out of a rainbow ! '' 
Nina turned away very coolly , and began arranging her music . 
And Nina skimmed across the floor , and out of the open door by which Clayton was lounging , and began busying herself amid the flowers that wreathed the porch . 
`` Have you ever studied the language of flowers , Nina ? '' 
Nina took the rose , coloring with vexation , and then , plucking from the bush a rose of two or three days ' bloom , whose leaves were falling out , she handed it to him , and said , `` Do you understand the signification of this ? '' 
`` So I observed , '' said Nina , turning away quickly ; then , making one of her darting movements , she was in the middle of the saloon again , just as the waiter announced dinner . 
Clayton rose gravely , and offered his arm to Aunt Nesbit ; and Nina found herself obliged to accept the delighted escort of Mr. Carson , who , entirely unperceiving , was in the briskest possible spirits , and established himself comfortably between Aunt Nesbit and Nina . 
replied Nina . 
At this moment Nina accidentally happened to catch Clayton 's eye , which was fixed upon Mr. Carson with an air of quiet amusement greatly disconcerting to her . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` aunt 's been busy about that ever since I can remember . '' 
`` That 's a very nice book , '' said Mr. Carson , looking solemnly at Nina ; `` only , Mrs. Nesbit , a n't you afraid of the infidel principle ? 
It seemed to Nina that , without looking at Clayton , she was forced to meet his eye . 
No matter whether she directed her attention to the asparagus or the potatoes , it was her fatality always to end by a rencounter with his eye ; and she saw , for some reason or other , the conversation was extremely amusing to him . 
`` For my part , '' said Nina , `` I do n't know what sort of principles Aunt Nesbit 's history , there , has ; but one thing I 'm pretty certain of , -- that I 'm not in any danger from any such thick , close-printed , old , stupid-looking books as that . 
I was like Nina , here , immersed in vanity and folly . '' 
`` People always talk , '' said Nina , reddening , `` as if there was but one kind of vanity and folly in the world . 
And she looked at Clayton indignantly , as she saw him laughing . 
said Nina , with a look of inexpressible relief . 
`` But , then , '' said Nina , `` you 'd have to make the history into a romance . '' 
`` Well , then , '' said Nina , `` I 'll confess , now , that about all the history I do know has been got from Walter Scott 's novels . 
said Nina . 
`` For my part , '' said Nina , `` I wish I could find that kind of history you are speaking of ; I believe I could read that . '' 
`` Well , I suppose , then , I 'm very wicked , '' said Nina ; `` but I do n't like anything useful . 
At this moment Harry appeared at the door , and requested to speak to Nina . 
After a few moments ' whispered conversation , she came back to the table , apparently disconcerted . 
she said . 
said Nina . 
`` Why , child , '' said Aunt Nesbit to Nina , after they returned to the parlor , `` I did not know that Mr. Clayton was an Episcopalian . '' 
`` He is n't , '' said Nina . 
With instinctive care for the feeling of the scene , Nina had arrayed herself in a black silk dress , and plain straw bonnet with black ribbon -- a mark of respect to the deceased remembered and narrated by Tiff for many a year after . 
As Clayton , in a musical voice , pronounced the words `` I am the resurrection and the life , '' Nina wept and sobbed as if the grief had been her own ; nor did she cease to weep during the whole touching service . 
It was the same impulsive nature which made her so gay in other scenes that made her so sympathetic here . 
When the whole was over , she kissed the children , and , shaking hands with old Tiff , promised to come and see them on the morrow . 
After which , Clayton led her to the carriage , into which he and Carson followed her . 
It pleases me , also , to see young ladies in your station , Nina , interest themselves in the humble concerns of the poor . 
Nina was filled with indignation at this monologue ; not considering that the man was giving the very best he had in him , and laboring assiduously at what he considered his vocation , the prevention of half an hour of silence in any spot of earth where he could possibly make himself heard . 
The same excitement which made Nina cry made him talk . 
But he was not content with talking , but insisted upon asking Nina , every moment , if she did n't think it an interesting occasion , and if she had not been much impressed . 
`` I do n't feel like talking , Mr. Carson , '' said Nina . 
Nina could have pushed him out of the carriage . 
Long before the carriage reached home , Nina had forgotten all her sympathy in a tumult of vexation . 
She discovered an increasing difficulty in making Carson understand , by any degree of coolness , that he was not acceptable ; and saw nothing before her but explanations in the very plainest terms , mortifying and humiliating as that might be . 
His perfect self-complacent ease , and the air with which he constantly seemed to appropriate her as something which of right belonged to himself , filled her with vexation . 
But yet her conscience told her that she had brought it upon herself . 
she said to herself , as she ascended the steps toward the parlor . 
`` I was amused enough , '' said Nina , `` with Old Hundred 's indignation at having to get out the carriage and horses to go over to what he called a ` cracker funeral . ' 
`` The children look very pretty and bright , '' said Nina . 
`` For my part , '' said Nina , `` I 'm sorry for them . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I shall do something for these children , at any rate . '' 
`` I quite agree with you , Nina . 
Nina frowned , and looked indignant . 
Mr. Carson went on remorselessly with his really good-hearted rattle , till Nina , at last , could bear it no longer . 
said she , springing up . 
Nina was as much annoyed at Clayton 's silence , and his quiet , observant reserve , as with Carson 's forth-putting . 
Rising from table , she passed on before the company , with a half-flying trip , into the hall , which lay now cool , calm , and breezy , in the twilight , with the odor of the pillar-roses floating in at the window . 
Nina would have given all the world to be still ; but , well aware that stillness was out of the question , she determined to select her own noise ; and , sitting down at the piano , began playing very fast , in a rapid , restless , disconnected manner . 
`` Wo n't you catch cold , Nina ? '' 
I never catch cold , '' said Nina , springing into the porch , and taking the delighted Mr. Carson 's arm . 
And away she went with him , with almost a skip and a jump , leaving Clayton tête-à-tête with Aunt Nesbit . 
Nina went so fast that her attendant was almost out of breath . 
They reached a little knoll , and there Nina stopped suddenly , and said , `` Look here , Mr. Carson ; I have something to say to you . '' 
`` I should be delighted , my dear Nina ! 
said Nina , putting up her hand to stop him . 
said Nina ; `` and for you , too . 
I really am , '' said she , good-naturedly ; `` but please now to understand how we stand . '' 
She turned , and tripped away . 
said she , to herself , `` at any rate , I 've done onething ! '' 
He stretched himself , rubbed his eyes , took out his watch and looked at it , and then began walking off with a very sober pace in the opposite direction from Nina . 
And , in the third place , contemplating Nina as the fox of old did his bunch of sour grapes , he began to remember that , after all , she was dressy , expensive , and extravagant . 
Nina returned to the house with the same decided air with which she went out , and awakened Mr. Clayton from a revery with a brisk little tap of her fan on his shoulder . 
`` Come up here with me , '' she said , `` and look out of the library window , and see this moonlight . '' 
And up she went , over the old oaken staircase , stopping on each landing ; and , beckoning to Clayton , with a whimsically authoritative gesture , threw open the door of a large , black-wainscoted room , and ushered him in . 
said Nina , in a hurried voice . 
After a moment 's thought , Nina added , with a sudden effort , `` But , after all , that was not what I wanted to speak to you about . 
`` I think , at all events , '' said Nina , `` I think it is no more than honorable that I should tell you exactly how things have stood . 
`` No , '' said Nina , after a few moments ' silence , `` not in sport , certainly ; but , yet , not enough in earnest . 
said Nina , with a sigh of relief . 
`` Well , Nina , to tell you the truth , sister Anne is a little bit conventional -- a little set in her ways ; but , after all , a large-hearted , warm-hearted woman . 
`` I do n't know about that , '' said Nina . 
`` Whereas , '' said Nina , `` most conventional people are like a shallow river , frozen to the bottom . 
`` You see , '' said Nina , `` though I 'm nothing but an ignorant school-girl , I 'm as proud as if I had everything to be proud of . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , rising , with animation , `` now , Mr. Edward Clayton , if we have settled about this moonlight , we may as well go down into the parlor , where Aunt Nesbit and Mr. Carson are tête-à-tête . '' 
`` Indeed he is , '' said Nina . 
Down they went , and Nina seemed like a person enfranchised . 
Never had she seemed more universally gracious . 
She was chatty and conversable with Carson , and sang over for him all her old opera-songs , with the better grace that she saw that Clayton was listening intently . 
said Nina , springing to the door , and looking out . 
She saw Harry hastening in advance to meet her , and ran down the veranda steps to speak to him . 
`` Miss Nina , it 's Master Tom , '' said Harry , in a low voice . 
said Nina , in a voice of apprehension . 
Nina reäscended the steps , and stood looking apprehensively towards the horseman , who approached every moment nearer . 
Harry came up on the veranda , and stood a little behind her . 
`` For pity 's sake , '' said Nina , turning and looking in Harry 's face , `` do n't have a scene here ! 
And Nina felt herself roughly seized in the arms of a shaggy great-coat , and kissed by lips smelling of brandy and tobacco . 
She faintly said , as she disengaged herself , `` Tom , is it you ? '' 
Nina followed him , and Clayton was absolutely shocked at the ghastly paleness of her face . 
Nina , '' said he , turning to her , with a tremendous oath , `` why do n't you introduce me ? 
said Nina , laying her hand on his arm , in a soothing tone . 
`` This gentleman is Mr. Clayton ; and , Mr. Clayton , '' she said , lifting her eyes to him , and speaking in a trembling voice , `` this is my brother . '' 
`` Mr. Carson , '' said Nina , `` my brother . '' 
A fiery gleam , like that of a steel blade , seemed to shoot from his blue eyes ; and each time that Nina said `` my brother , '' he drew in his breath , as one who seeks to restrain himself in some violent inward emotion . 
He made a movement to pull Nina towards him , which she resisted with an air of terror , looking at her aunt , who , more terrified still , sat with her feet drawn up on the sofa , as if he had been a mad dog . 
Nina remembered the storms of oaths and curses that had terrified her when a child ; the times that she had seen her father looking like death , leaning his head on his hand , and sighing as only those sigh who have an only son worse than dead . 
It is no wonder , therefore , that Nina , generally courageous and fearless as she was , should have become fearful and embarrassed at his sudden return . 
`` Tom , '' she said , softly , coming up to him , `` you have n't been to supper . 
said he , catching her round the waist , and drawing her on his knee . 
Tell me , '' continued he , still holding her on his knee , `` which of them is it , Nin ? 
And the event proved so ; for , on sitting down to supper , Tom Gordon passed regularly through all the stages of drunkenness ; became as outrageously affectionate as he had been before surly , kissed Nina and Aunt Nesbit , cried over his sins and confessed his iniquities , laughed and cried feebly , till at last he sank in his chair asleep . 
Nina , on her part , retired to a troubled pillow . 
She foresaw nothing before her but mortification and embarrassment , and realized more than ever the peculiar loneliness of her situation . 
For all purposes of consultation and aid , Aunt Nesbit was nobody in her esteem , and Nina was always excited and vexed by every new attempt that she made to confide in her . 
`` Now , to-morrow , '' she said to herself , as she lay down , `` no one knows what will turn up . 
As Nina said this , she saw some one standing by her bed . 
It was Milly , who stooped tenderly over her , smoothing and arranging the bed-clothes in a motherly way . 
`` The worst of it is , '' said Nina , `` that I do n't know what he will do to-morrow -- and before Mr. Clayton , too ! 
said Nina . 
said Milly to Nina , in a gentle tone . 
said Nina , lifting up her head from the pillow . 
Nina looked at her with surprise . 
`` Well , but , Milly , '' said Nina , apprehensively , `` you know I 've been a very bad girl about religion . 
So saying , Milly smoothed the pillow with anxious care , and , kissing Nina on the forehead , departed . 
`` I say , Nina , '' said her brother , coming in , a day or two after , from a survey that he had been taking round the premises , `` you want mehere to manage this place . 
`` I do n't know , '' said Nina . 
said Nina , with a heightened color . 
`` Moreover , '' said Nina , `` I wish you to let everything on this place entirely alone ; and remember that my servants are not your servants , and that you have no control over them , whatever . '' 
said Nina , who really began to be alarmed . 
`` If you please , Miss Nina , come and show me which of your muslins you wish to be done up , as I 's starching for Miss Loo . '' 
Glad of an opportunity to turn the conversation , Nina ran up to her room , whither she was followed by Milly , who shut the door , and spoke to her in mysterious tones . 
`` Miss Nina , ca n't you make some errand to get Harry off the place for two or three days , while Mas ' r Tom 's round ? '' 
`` But what right , '' said Nina , with heightened color , `` has he to dictate to my servants , or me ? 
Pale and trembling , Nina descended into the room ; and , in a few moments after , Milly appeared , followed by Harry . 
said Nina , in a trembling voice , `` I want you to take your horse and go over to Uncle John 's plantation , and carry a note for me . '' 
Harry stood with his arms folded , and his eyes fixed upon the ground , and Nina continued , `` And , Harry , I think you had better make some business or errand to keep you away two or three days , or a week . '' 
`` Miss Nina , '' said Harry , `` the affairs of the place are very pressing now , and need overlooking . 
said Nina . 
She laid her hand softly on his . 
Nina , who was standing with her back to the window , wondered at the expression of his countenance . 
`` Look there , Miss Nina ! '' 
Nina turned , and in an instant the color mounted to her cheeks ; her little form seemed to dilate , and her eyes flashed fire ; and before Harry could see what she was doing , she was down in the gravel-walk , and had taken Lisette 's hand . 
`` Go in , Lisette , '' said Nina ; `` take the things into my room , and I 'll come to you . '' 
During this cruel harangue Harry 's hands twitched and quivered , and he started every now and then , looking first at Nina , and then at his tormentor . 
He turned deadly pale ; even his lips were of ashy whiteness ; and , with his arms still folded , and making no reply , he fixed his large blue eyes upon Tom , and , as it sometimes happened in moments of excitement and elevation , there appeared on the rigid lines of his face , at that moment , so strong a resemblance to Col. Gordon , that Nina noticed and was startled by it . 
Nina hastened to interfere . 
said Nina . 
He turned and looked upon her with an evil smile , turned again , and was gone . 
she added , in a lower voice . 
said Nina . 
`` You do n't know how our affairs stand , Miss Nina , '' said Harry , hurriedly . 
`` Well , Harry , '' said Nina , `` I 'll sell everything I 've got -- my jewels -- everything ! 
Nina gave her orders with a dignity as if she had been a princess , and in all his agitation Harry could not help marvelling at the sudden air of womanliness which had come over her . 
But , '' he added , in a tone which made Nina tremble , `` I hate everybody else ! 
`` Harry , '' said Nina , `` you do wrong -- you forget yourself ! '' 
Nina remembered to have seen her father in transports of passion , and was again shocked and startled to see the resemblance between his face and the convulsed face before her . 
`` Harry , '' she said , in a pitying , half-admonitory tone , `` do think what you are saying ! 
`` Well , Harry , '' said Nina , after a moment 's thought , `` my love shall not be a clasp upon anychain ; for , as there is a God in heaven , I will set you free ! 
Clayton , who had been passing through the shrubbery , and who had remarked that Nina was engaged in a very exciting conversation , had drawn off , and stood waiting for her at the foot of the veranda steps . 
As soon as Nina saw him , she reached out her hand frankly , saying , `` O , there , Mr. Clayton , you are just the person ! 
`` Wait here a moment , '' said she , `` till I get ready . 
And , running up the steps , she passed quickly by him , and went into the house . 
He did not wish to intrude upon Nina any embarrassing recognition of her situation , even under the guise of sympathy and assistance ; and waited , therefore , till some word from her should authorize him to speak . 
He held himself , therefore , ready to meet any confidence which she might feel disposed to place in him ; not doubting , from the frankness of her nature , that she would soon find it impossible not to speak of what was so deeply interesting to her . 
Nina soon reäppeared , and , mounting their horses , they found themselves riding through the same forest-road that led to the cottage of Tiff , from which a divergent path went to the Belleville plantation . 
`` I 'm glad to see you alone this morning , for many reasons , '' said Nina ; `` for I think I never needed a friend 's help more . 
`` I ca n't say , '' said Nina . 
`` Thank you , '' said Nina , frankly . 
In former days , Nina had known this as the residence of an ancient rich family , with whom her father was on visiting terms . 
She was therefore uncomfortably struck with the air of poverty , waste , and decay , everywhere conspicuous through the grounds . 
Nothing is more depressing and disheartening than the sight of a gradual decay of what has been arranged and constructed with great care ; and when Nina saw the dilapidated gateway , the crushed and broken shrubbery , the gaps in the fine avenue where trees had been improvidently cut down for fire-wood , she could not help a feeling of depression . 
said she . 
As she said this , their horses came up the front of the house , in which the same marks of slovenly neglect were apparent . 
On the alighting of Nina and Clayton at the door , they all left their sports , and arranged themselves in a grinning row , to see the new comers descend . 
And Nina and Clayton were now marshalled by the whole seven of them into an apartment on the right of the great hall . 
Nina sent up her card by one of the small fry , who , having got half-way up the staircase , was suddenly taken with the desire to slide down the banisters with it in his hand . 
They were aroused , however , by the entrance of the man with half a hat ; who , on Nina 's earnest suggestion , plunged into the troop , which ran , chattering and screaming like so many crows , to different parts of the hall , while he picked up the card , and , with infinite good-will beaming on his shining black face , went up with it , leaving Nina and Clayton waiting below . 
Nina tripped promptly after him , and left Clayton the sole tenant of the parlor for an hour . 
At length she returned , skipping down the stairs , and opening the door with great animation . 
she said . 
said Nina . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` she 's one of the tow-string order of women . 
`` Do you know , '' said Nina , `` people think it 's a dreadful thing to be an abolitionist ? 
said Nina . 
said Nina , looking at him with a good deal of interest . 
There was something about the face of this man which , at the first glance , Nina felt to be very repulsive . 
There was something in the expression of the eye which struck Nina as hard and cold . 
`` Good-morrow , Nina , '' said her brother , drawing his horse up to meet hers , and signing to his companion to arrest his , also . 
said Nina . 
And , touching her horse , she passed them in a moment . 
Looking back almost fiercely , a moment , she turned and said to Clayton : `` I hate that man ! '' 
said Nina . 
`` Tom 's badness , '' continued Nina , speaking as if she were following out a train of thought without regarding her companion 's remark , `` is good turned to bad . 
`` O , '' said Nina , resuming her usual gay tones , `` do n't you know that girls and dogs , and other inferior creatures , have the gift of seeing what 's in people ? 
And , as she spoke , she turned to him with a fascinating air of half-saucy defiance . 
said Nina , with energy ; `` I knew what you were the very first time I saw you . 
`` What , Nina ? '' 
`` May be so , '' said Nina ; `` yet , I do n't think I shall like that man , after all . 
Onentering the house , Nina was met at the door by Milly , with a countenance of some anxiety . 
`` Miss Nina , '' she said , `` your aunt has heard bad news , this morning . '' 
said Nina , quickly , -- `` what ? '' 
`` Well , honey , ye see dere has been a lawyer here , '' said Milly , following Nina as she was going up stairs ; `` and she has been shut up with him all de mornin ' ; and when he come out I found her taking on quite dreadful ! 
And she says she has lost all her property . '' 
said Nina . 
`` Yes ; but , '' said Nina , `` you know she can always live here with us ; and what little money she wants to fuss with , to buy new caps , and paregoric for her cough , and all such little matters , we can give her , easily enough . '' 
`` Ah , Miss Nina , your heart is free enough ; you 'd give away both ends of the rainbow , if you had 'em to give . 
Why , just look on it , Miss Nina . 
I know , Miss Nina , young ladies do n't like to hear about dese things ; but the fac ' is , victuals cost something , and dere must be some on us to bring in something . 
I ca n't spare you at all , '' said Nina . 
I tell you , Miss Nina , I looked that gen ` leman over pretty well for you , and my opinion is he 'll do . ' 
said Nina . 
`` Law sakes , Miss Nina ! 
And now , Miss Nina , you go right along and give him a good word , 'cause you see , dear lamb , you needa good husband to take care of you , -- dat 's what you want , chile . 
`` O , but , do you know , Milly , '' said Nina , `` I 've something to tell you , which I had liked to have forgotten ! 
`` You has , Miss Nina ! 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I 've done it . 
`` Mr. Clayton lent it to me , '' said Nina . 
Nina was annoyed by the presence of Mr. Jekyl , whom her brother insisted should remain to dinner . 
Those unperceiving people , who never notice the embarrassment of others , and who walk with the greatest facility into the gaps of conversation , simply because they have no perception of any difficulty there , have their hour ; and Nina felt positively grateful to Mr. Carson for the continuous and cheerful rattle which had so annoyed her the day before . 
Carson drove a brisk talk with the lawyer about the value of property , percentage , etc. ; he sympathized with Aunt Nesbit on her last-caught cold ; rallied Tom on his preöccupation ; complimented Nina on her improved color from her ride ; and seemed on such excellent terms both with himself and everybody else , that the thing was really infectious . 
`` That 's what I believe , '' said Nina , warmly . 
Nina looked excessively annoyed , and turned a sort of appealing glance upon Clayton . 
From this point the conversation was pursued with considerable warmth , till Nina and Aunt Nesbit rose and retired to the drawing-room . 
Perhaps it did not materially discourage Clayton , in the position he had taken , that Nina , with the frankness usual to her , expressed the most eager and undisguised admiration of all that he said . 
she said to Aunt Nesbit , as she came in the drawing-room . 
He 's been making some investigations , Nina , and he 's going to talk to you about them , after dinner . 
said Nina . 
`` Nina , how often I have warned you against such sudden prejudices -- against such a good man , too ! '' 
`` That 's true enough , '' said Nina ; `` and I 'll hear , and try and behave as well as I can . 
Aunt Nesbit looked at Nina as if she considered her in a most hopeless condition . 
Afterthe return of the gentlemen to the drawing-room , Nina , at the request of Tom , followed him and Mr. Jekyl into the library . 
`` Mr. Jekyl is going to make some statements to us , Nina , about our property in Mississippi , which , if they turn out as he expects , will set us up in the world , '' said Tom . 
Nina threw herself carelessly into the leathern arm-chair by the window , and looked out of it . 
Nina had been sitting regarding Mr. Jekyl with a fixed and determined expression of countenance . 
When he had finished , she said to him , `` Mr. Jekyl , I understand you are an elder in the church ; is that true ? '' 
`` Because , '' said Nina , `` I am a wild young girl , and do n't profess to know much about religion ; but I want you to tell me , as a Christian , if you think it would be rightto take this woman and children , and her property . '' 
`` I should think , '' said Nina , `` that you might see with the eye of the Gospel , sometimes ! 
Like many other young persons , Nina could feelher way out of a sophistry much sooner than she could think it out ; and she answered to all this reasoning , `` After all , I ca n't think it would be right . '' 
`` All I have to say , Mr. Jekyl , '' said Nina , `` is just this : that I wo n't have anything to do with this matter ; for , if I ca n't prove it 's wrong , I shall always feel it is . '' 
`` Nina , how ridiculous ! '' 
`` I have said my say , '' said Nina , as she rose and left the room . 
Mr. Jekyl was not now talking to convince Tom Gordon , but himself ; for , spite of himself , Nina 's questions had awakened in his mind a sufficient degree of misgiving to make it necessary for him to pass in review the arguments by which he generally satisfied himself . 
The trembling , eager tone of pity , in which Nina had spoken of the woman and children who were about to be made victims of a legal process , had excited but a moment 's pause . 
Ninaspent the evening in the drawing-room ; and her brother , in the animation of a new pursuit , forgetful of the difference of the morning , exerted himself to be agreeable , and treated her with more consideration and kindness than he had done any time since his arrival . 
He even made some off-hand advances towards Clayton , which the latter received with good-humor , and which went further than she supposed to raise the spirits of Nina ; and so , on the whole , she passed a more than usually agreeable evening . 
On retiring to her room , she found Milly , who had been for some time patiently waiting for her , having despatched her mistress to bed some time since . 
`` Well , Miss Nina , I am going on my travels in the morning . 
`` But you have never been used to living except in our family , '' said Nina , `` and , somehow , I feel afraid . 
I never yet seed de folks I could n't suit , '' she added , with a glow of honest pride . 
Nina , whose quick sympathies were touched by the earnestness of her old friend , and still more aroused by the allusion to her mother , answered , `` O , yes , come , tell me about it ! '' 
And , drawing a low ottoman , she sat down , and laid her head on the lap of her humble friend . 
Laws , Miss Nina , when I tells you dis yere one you 've got here is a good one , and I ` vise you to take him , it 's because I knows what comes o ' girls marrying high fellows . 
Law , when he was a courting Miss Harrit , it was all nobody but her . 
She was going to be his angel , and he was going to give up all sorts of bad ways , and live sucha good life ! 
she married him ; it all went to smoke ! 
She did n't laugh no more ; she got sharp and cross , and she wa n't good to me like what she used to be . 
She took to be jealous of me and her husband . 
She might have saved herself de trouble . 
She had three children , and , at last , he was killed , one day , falling off his horse when he was too drunk to hold the bridle . 
-- You may be sure , now , I pricked up my ears , Miss Nina . 
`` O , laws , Miss Nina , I tell you dis yer fell on me like so much lead . 
`` 'Cause , you see , Miss Nina , Paul , he was a Christian . 
said Nina . 
but , '' said Nina , `` it does seem impossible that a woman -- a lady born , too , and my aunt -- could do such a thing ! '' 
O , dere 's been times -- dere was times ` long first , Miss Nina , when my first chil ` en was sold -- dat , I tell you , I poured out my soul to Miss Harrit , and I 've seen dat ar woman cry so dat I was sorry for her . 
Laws , Miss Nina , folks may say what dey like about de black folks , dey 'll never beat it out of my head ; -- dere 's some on 'em can be as smart as any white folks , if dey could have de same chance . 
`` Well , Miss Nina , it seemed as if my heart and everything in it stopped still . 
`` And said she , ` Yes . ' 
And she told me it was dis yer way : Dat Stiles -- he dat was Jones 's overseer -- had heard dat Alfred was dreadful spirity ; and when boys is so , sometimes dey aggravates 'em to get 'em riled , and den dey whips 'em to break 'em in . 
Nina drew in her breath hard , with an instinctive shudder . 
She sat so for a few minutes , and then her muscles relaxed , her eyes gradually softened ; she looked tenderly , but solemnly , down on Nina . 
O , Miss Nina , if ever ye 're tempted to hate anybody , think how ' t 'll be with 'em when dey comes to die . 
`` She died hard , poor thing ! 
and she was cast down ` bout her sins . 
Aboutfour miles east of Canema lay the plantation of Nina 's uncle , whither Harry had been sent on the morning which we have mentioned . 
Uncle Jack , as Nina always called him , was the nominal guardian of the estate , and a more friendly and indulgent one Harry could not have desired . 
In a convenient pause , he found opportunity to say , `` Miss Nina sent me over here , this morning . '' 
She did ? 
Why could n't she come over herself , and comfort an old fellow 's heart ? 
`` Miss Nina is in a good deal of trouble . 
Master Tom came home last night drunk , and to-day he is so cross and contrary she ca n't do anything with him . '' 
`` There 's two gentlemen there , attending upon Miss Nina . 
she is n't going to marry a d -- d Yankee ! 
`` Miss Nina sent me over here to be out of Master Tom 's way , '' said Harry , after a pause . 
He quarrels with her about the management of everything on the place ; and you know , sir , that I try to do my very best , and you and Mrs. Gordon have always been pleased to say that I did well . '' 
`` It 's very hard on Miss Nina , '' said Harry . 
`` He interferes , and I have no power to stand for her . 
Why , chile , would you turn against Miss Nina ? 
In answer to Nina 's letter of invitation , Anne had come with her father , who was called to that vicinity by the duties of his profession . 
Nina received her with her usual gay frankness of manner ; and Anne , like many others , soon found herself liking her future sister much better than she had expected . 
Perhaps , had Nina been in any other situation than that of hostess , her pride might have led her to decline making the agreeable to Anne , whom , notwithstanding , she very much wished to please . 
But she was mistress of the mansion , and had an Arab 's idea of the privileges of a guest ; and so she chatted , sang , and played , for her ; she took her about , showed her the walks , the arbors , the flowergarden ; waited on her in her own apartment , with a thousand little attentions , all the more fascinating from the kind of careless independence with which they were rendered . 
Besides , Nina had vowed a wicked little vow in her heart that she would ride rough-shod over Anne 's dignity ; that she would n't let her be grave or sensible , but that she should laugh and frolic with her . 
Nina 's gayety , when in full tide , had a breezy infectiousness in it , that seemed to stir up every one about her , and carry them on the tide of her own spirits ; and Anne , in her company , soon found herself laughing at everything and nothing , simply because she felt gay . 
With him came Madam Gordon , or , as Nina commonly called her , Aunt Maria . 
She was a portly , finely-formed , middle-aged woman , who might have been handsome , had not the lines of care and nervous anxiety ploughed themselves so deeply in her face . 
Her bright , keen , hazel eyes , fine teeth , and the breadth of her ample form , attested the vitality of the old Virginia stock from whence she sprung . 
`` There , '' said Nina , to Anne Clayton , as they sat in the shady side of the veranda , `` I 've marshalled Aunt Maria up into Aunt Nesbit 's room , and there they will have a comfortable dish of lamentation over me . '' 
Now , when Aunt Katy comes and wants to know , so respectfully , ` What Miss Nina is going to have for dinner , ' do you suppose she has the least expectation of getting anything that I order ? 
She always has fifty objections to anything that I propose . 
`` I did n't know I was arguing ; but I shall be glad to have anything on my side , '' said Nina , `` of course . '' 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I do n't like Shakspeare , there ! 
`` But I ca n't understanda great deal that Shakspeare says , '' said Nina . 
said Nina . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I 'm much obliged to you for all the sense you find in my nonsense . 
At this moment the attention of Nina was attracted by loud exclamations from that side of the house where the negro cottages were situated . 
No , no , Miss Nina do n't want none o ' yo old fish ! 
She 's got plenty of niggers to ketch her own fish . '' 
`` Somebody taking my name in vain in those regions , '' said Nina , running to the other end of the veranda . 
`` Tomtit , '' she said to that young worthy , who lay flat on his back , kicking up his heels in the sun , waiting for his knives to clean themselves , `` pray tell me what 's going on there ! '' 
`` Send him round here to me , '' said Nina , who , partly from humanity , and partly from a spirit of contradiction , had determined to take up for the poor white folks , on all occasions . 
His cheeks were sunken and hollow , and he stood before Nina with a cringing , half-ashamed attitude ; and yet one might see that , with better dress and better keeping , he might be made to assume the appearance of a handsome , intelligent man . 
she said to him . 
said Nina , drawing out her purse . 
said Nina . 
`` Dear me , '' said her Uncle John , who had been standing for a moment listening to the conversation . 
And Nina paid the man a liberal sum , and dismissed him . 
`` I suppose , now , all my eloquence would n't make Rose cook those fish for dinner , '' said Nina . 
`` I 'll warrant not , '' said Nina . 
said Nina . 
`` Well , but , Uncle John , '' said Nina , `` my dear old gentleman , you have n't travelled , as I have . '' 
`` But you ought to see the northernworking people , '' said Nina . 
`` Now , '' said Nina , `` Uncle John , you dear old heathen , you ! 
`` O , as to that , I labor in my vocation , '' said Nina ; `` that is , of enlightening dull , sleepy old gentlemen , who never travelled out of the state they were born in , and do n't know what can be done . 
`` Do , '' said Nina ; `` I should like a little prospective information . '' 
Nina , as often , spoke before she thought . 
Nina could not recall the words . 
She colored deeply , and went on hastily to change the subject . 
`` I declare , '' said Nina , looking along the avenue , `` what 's that ? 
but Nina has a great idea of patronizing them . '' 
`` Clear Gordon , every inch of her ! '' 
said Aunt Maria , as Nina ran down to meet Tiff . 
`` Just like her uncle ! '' 
Meanwhile , Nina had run down the avenue , and was busy in a confidential communication with Tiff . 
On her return , she came skipping up the steps , apparently in high glee . 
`` The trouble with you , Uncle John , '' said Nina , `` is that you do n't stayconverted . 
`` Now , '' said Nina , `` shall we set off to-morrow morning ? '' 
And so , before Old Tiff , who had brought the first intelligence to the plantation , had time to depart , Tomtit had trumpeted the news through all the cluster of negrohouses that skirted the right side of the mansion , proclaiming that `` dere was gwine to be a camp-meeting , and tip-top work of grace , and Miss Nina was going to let all de niggers go . '' 
Miss Nina 's allers good to ye , a n't she ? 
Ye must memorize dat ar , Miss Fanny , and talk like Miss Nina . 
Now , you see , Miss Nina has got de prettiest way of saying her words . 
Now , you mind , 'cause she 's coming to see us off and on -- she promised so . 
And den you keep a good lookout how she walks , and how she holds her pocket-handkerchief . 
And when she sits down she kind o ' gives a little flirt to her clothes , so dey all set out round her like ruffles . 
said Nina , putting her head out . 
`` Please , Miss Nina , de hosses is so full o ' tickle , dis yer mornin ' , I could n't let go , no ways ! '' 
`` O , laws bless you , Miss Nina , '' said Tiff , restored to his usual spirits , `` ' t a n't nothin ' . 
`` Pray , '' said Nina , `` how are little Miss Fanny , and the children ? '' 
If Nina had heaped Tiff with presents , she could not have conferred the inexpressible obligation conveyed in these words . 
`` There , '' said Nina , `` John , you may drive on . 
Consequently , Nina was beset to allow her people to have a tent , in which they were to take turns in staying all night , as candidates for the blessing . 
In compliance with that law of good-humored indulgence which had been the traditionary usage of her family , Nina acceded ; and the Gordon tent spread its snowy sails , to the rejoicing of their hearts . 
Nina , leaning on the arm of Clayton , walked about the area with the rest . 
To Nina the scene was quite new , for a long residence in the Northern States had placed her out of the way of such things ; and her shrewd insight into character , and her love of drollery , found an abundant satisfaction in the various little points and oddities of the scene . 
Nina and Uncle John stood at the tent-door laughing heartily . 
said Nina , looking round at her . 
`` O , '' said Nina , `` I do n't respect religion any the less for a good laugh at its oddities . 
said Nina , as a general movement on the ground proclaimed the arrival of some one who appeared to be exciting general interest . 
With a good-natured view of doing him a pleasure , Nina selected a spot for their nooning at no great distance , and spoke in the most gracious and encouraging manner to them , from time to time . 
Miss Nina sees dese yer chil ` en a n't de common sort -- dat 's what she does ! '' 
said Nina , who had overheard some of the last words . 
The party enjoyed their dinner with infinite relish , and Nina amused herself in watching Tiff 's cooking preparations . 
said Nina , getting up , and looking into the pot . 
And , when Nina placed on their simple board -- literally a board , and nothing more -- a small loaf of frosted cake , in exchange , it certainly required all the grace of the morning exercises to keep Tiff within due bounds of humility . 
said Nina . 
`` Dey 's pretty far , Miss Nina . 
You see , Miss Nina , what I 's studdin ' on , lately , is , how to get dese yer chil ` en to Canaan ; and I hars fus with one ear , and den with t ' oder , but ` pears like a n't clar ` bout it , yet . 
Perhaps , Miss Nina , now , you could tell me someting . '' 
said Nina ; `` I do n't know anything about these things . 
I think I feel a little like Uncle John , '' she said , turning to Clayton . 
said Nina . 
`` I 'm afraid , Nina , '' said Aunt Nesbit , in a low tone , to the latter , `` I 'm afraid he is n't orthodox . '' 
Nina shrank back , and clung to Clayton 's arm . 
So vehement was the surging feeling of the throng around her , that she wept with a wild , tremulous excitement . 
she said . 
`` But , do n't you think , '' said Nina , `` that these things do harm sometimes ? '' 
`` I do not like these terrible threats , '' said Nina . 
`` But I want to be religious , '' said Nina , `` entirely apart from such considerations . 
`` I wish I were like Milly , '' said Nina . 
And , as he spoke , he turned his face up to the moonlight with an earnest fervor of expression , that struck Nina deeply . 
He looked at her with a beautiful smile , which was a peculiar expression of his face in moments of high excitement . 
The horrors and sorrows of the slave-coffle were a sealed book to Nina and Anne Clayton . 
`` I think , '' said Nina , `` the sound of the singing at these camp-meetings is really quite spirit-stirring and exciting . '' 
`` Well , now , '' said Nina , `` to tell the truth , I should like to go out again to-day . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` you do hear some queer things there . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` did you notice poor Old Tiff , so intent upon getting his children converted ? 
`` My dear , '' said Nina , `` Tiff prostrates himself at my shrine , every time he meets me , to implore my favorable supervision as to that point ; and it really is diverting to hear him talk . 
`` I 'm not going to take all the whites , '' said Nina . 
said Nina . 
`` Look ye here , now , Clayton , '' said Uncle John , tipping him a sly wink , after he had handed Nina in , `` you must confess that little penitent ! 
He knew perfectly that his best chance , with a nature so restless as Nina 's , was to keep up a sense of perfect freedom in all their intercourse ; and , therefore , no grandfather could have been more collected and easy in a tête-à-tête drive than he . 
`` That was a very good sermon , '' said Nina , `` and I believe every word of it . 
`` I should think anybody 's common sense would show that a thing which works so poorly for both sides could n't be from God , '' said Nina . 
said Clayton to her , aside . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` there 's Uncle John 's view of the millennium ! '' 
Clayton , Nina , and Anne , laughed . 
`` Now , '' said Nina , `` to see uncle so jovial and free , and ` Hail fellow well met , ' with everybody , you 'd think he was the greatest democrat that ever walked . 
Nina and Clayton naturally fell into a quiet and subdued train of conversation . 
`` It is strange , '' said Nina , `` these talkings and searchings about religion . 
`` Now , Livy , '' said Nina , `` was remarkable . 
`` That , '' said Nina , eagerly , `` is just the way I feel toward Livy . 
`` Do you know , '' said Nina , after something of a pause , `` that I ca n't help wondering what you took up with me for ? 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` if you willhave the bad taste , then , to insist on liking me , let me warn you that you do n't know what you are about . 
I shall leave open drawers , and scatter papers , and forget the day of the month , and tear the newspaper , and do everything else that is wicked ; and then , one of these days , it will be , ` Nina , why have n't you done this ? 
said Nina , drawing a long breath , and pretending to laugh . 
`` So , then , '' said Nina , looking round with a half-laugh and half-blush , `` you willpersist ? '' 
And , as he spoke , he passed his arm round Nina firmly , and fixed his eyes on hers . 
Although it was gravely insisted to the last that there was no engagementbetween Nina and Clayton , it became evident enough to all parties that only the name was wanting . 
The warmest possible friendship existed between Nina and Anne ; and , notwithstanding that Nina almost every day said something which crossed Anne 's nicely-adjusted views , and notwithstanding Anne had a gentle infusion of that disposition to sermonize which often exists in very excellent young ladies , still the two got on excellently well together . 
It is to be confessed that , the week after they left , Nina was rather restless and lonesome , and troubled to pass her time . 
An incident , which we shall relate , however , gave her something to think of , and opens a new page in our story . 
While sitting on the veranda , after breakfast , her attention was called by various exclamations from the negro department , on the right side of the mansion ; and , looking out , to her great surprise , she saw Milly standing amid a group , who were surrounding her with eager demonstrations . 
said Nina , laying hold of her friend , and drawing her towards the steps . 
Nina , after having dismissed the special train of the juveniles and servants , began to examine into the condition of her friend . 
The arm had evidently been grazed by a bullet , producing somewhat of a deep flesh-wound , which had been aggravated by the heat of the weather and the fatigue which she had undergone . 
On removing the bandage around her head , a number of deep and severe fleshcuts were perceived . 
said Nina . 
said Nina . 
why , of course , these are to be bandaged and put up , in the first place , '' said Nina , bustling about with great promptness , tearing off bandages , and ringing for warm water . 
said Nina , as she proceeded rapidly with her undertaking , washing and bandaging the wound . 
`` There , now , '' she said , `` you look something like ; and now you shall lie down in my room , and take a little rest ! '' 
And Nina , with her usual energy , waited on her there , closed the blinds , and spread a shawl over her after she had lain down , and , after charging her two or three times to go to sleep and be quiet , she left her . 
She could hardly wait to have her get through her nap , so full was she of the matter , and so interested to learn the particulars of her story . 
she said to Aunt Nesbit . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I shall write to Clayton about it directly . 
said Nina , in an indignant tone , as she flung out of the room , and went to look softly in at Milly 's door . 
A perfectly vigorous physical system , and vital powers all moving in the finest order , enabled her to endure much more than ordinary ; and Nina soon became satisfied that no material injury had been sustained , and that in a few days she would be quite recovered . 
`` And now , Milly , do pray tell me where you have been , '' said Nina , `` and what this is all about . '' 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` you did well to come home ; and I tell you what , I 'm going to have that man prosecuted ! '' 
`` O , laws , no , Miss Nina ! 
`` Laws , Miss Nina , why , dere is some sense in dat ; but I would n't do it as bearing malice . '' 
`` Not at all , '' said Nina . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` such people must be taught that the law will take hold of them . 
Nina went immediately to her room , and despatched a long letter to Clayton , full of all the particulars , and begging his immediate assistance . 
In fact , as soon as the letter could go to him , and he could perform a rapid horseback journey , he was once more a member of the domestic circle . 
He entered upon the case with great confidence and enthusiasm . 
`` It is a debt which we owe , '' he said , `` to the character of our state , and to the purity of our institutions , to prove the efficiency of the law in behalf of that class of our population whose helplessness places them more particularly under our protection . 
He went immediately to the neighboring town , where Milly had been employed , and found , fortunately , that the principal facts had been subject to the inspection of white witnesses . 
Clayton 's father , mother , and sister , with Nina , at the time of the dialogue we have given , were sitting together in the parlor of a friend 's house in E. , discussing the same event . 
`` Why , '' said Nina , `` I thought cases were always decided according to law ! 
If ever a woman feels proud of her lover , it is when she sees him as a successful public speaker ; and Nina , when the case was over , stood half-laughing , half-blushing , in a circle of ladies , who alternately congratulated and rallied her on Clayton 's triumph . 
After the scene of the trial which we have described , he returned to his business , and Anne solicited Nina to accompany her for a few weeks to their plantation at Magnolia Grove , whither , as in duty bound , we may follow her . 
The range of apartments which opened on the veranda where Anne and Nina were sitting were darkened to exclude the flies ; but the doors , standing open , gave picture-like gleams of the interior . 
Nina had been there but a day , yet could not fail to read in the eyes of all how absolute was the reign which Anne held over their affections . 
said Nina . 
`` Yes , I see , '' said Nina , `` you are not nominally like me , but really housekeeper . 
`` Indeed , '' said Nina , `` you must have magic power , for I never saw a household move on so harmoniously . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I should n't think you could have had our Tomtit here ! 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` I have something in me which makes me feel this would be the right way . 
`` Well , it is so , '' said Nina . 
I assure you , Nina , I never appreciated the wisdom of God , in the laws which he made for the Jews in the wilderness , as I have since I 've tried the experiment myself of trying to bring a set of slaves out of barbarism . 
said Nina . 
said Nina . 
Nina 's practised eye observed that Mr. Bradshaw had that particular nervous , restless air , which belongs to a man who is charged with a particular message , and finds himself unexpectedly blockaded by the presence of a third person . 
So , after breakfast , exclaiming that she had left her crochetneedle in her apartment , and resisting Anne 's offer to send a servant for it , by declaring that nobody could find it but herself , she left the veranda . 
The moment the door of the parlor was closed after Nina , he drew a chair near to Anne , and sat down , with the unmistakable air of a man who is going into a confidential communication . 
And Anne stepped across the shady parlor , and in a few moments reäppeared with Nina , both arrayed in white cape-bonnets . 
Anne nodded at Nina , and cast on him a satisfied glance . 
Anne walked about superintending the whole ; and Nina , who saw the scene for the first time , could not repress her exclamation of delight . 
`` Do you know , '' said Nina , laughing , `` that I thought that he was some poor , desperate mortal , who was on the verge of a proposal , this morning , and I ran away like a good girl , to give him a fair field ? '' 
said Nina . 
But , Nina , dear , I 'm sorry that our affairs here are giving offence and making uneasiness . '' 
`` For my part , '' said Nina , `` I should go right on . 
said Nina , `` and what a comical-looking fellow he is ! 
she said , throwing a letter on Nina 's lap , and at the same time breaking the seal of one directed to herself . 
said Nina . 
Aboutfive o'clock in the evening , Nina and Anne amused themselves with setting a fancy tea-table on the veranda . 
Nina had gathered a quantity of the leaves of the live oak , which she possessed a particular faculty of plaiting in long , flat wreaths , and with these she garlanded the social round table , after it had been draped in its snowy damask , while Anne was busy arranging fruit in dishes with vine-leaves . 
`` O , Lettice must allow me to show my accomplishments , '' said Nina . 
As Nina talked , she was flitting hither and thither , taking up and laying down flowers and leaves , shaking out long sprays , and fluttering from place to place , like a bird . 
said Nina . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina ; `` and , what seems worse , beauty itself becomes dirt in a day . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` I could n't help thinking of that when we were at the camp-meeting . 
`` Now , I 'm one of that sort , '' said Nina , `` that love order dearly , but do n't want the trouble of it myself . 
It seems as if I should dieif I did n't get the thing I wanted that minute ; and , after two or three such attacks on a drawer , then comes repentance , and a long time of rolling up and arranging , and talking to little naughty Nina , who always promises herself to keep better order in future . 
But , my dear , she does n't do it , I 'm sorry to say , as yet , though perhaps there are hopes of her in future . 
said Nina , giving a sigh . 
said Nina , when he had departed . 
said Nina . 
`` Perhaps , '' said Nina , `` his moral nature is something like the cypress-vine seeds which I planted three months ago , and which have just come up . '' 
`` There are two , '' said Nina . 
Nina and Anne could hear , `` O , I see de mas ' r a comin ' up de track , His horse 's heels do clatter , with a clack , clack , clack ! '' 
`` You really have made quite a triumphal entry , '' said Nina . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , `` the Magnolia Grove Opera House is to be opened , and the Magnolia Troubadour Troupe to appear for the first time . '' 
said Nina . 
`` Never mind , '' she said , snatching a spray of multiflora rose , `` this will do . '' 
And she gave it one twist round her head , and her toilet was complete . 
`` Yes , '' said Nina . 
A wreath of orange-blossoms was significantly directed at Nina , and fell right into her lap . 
`` Why , '' said Nina , `` it seems to me they are beginning in a very doleful way . '' 
`` Now , Anne , is coming your turn , '' said Nina , as Dulcimer launched out , in most high-flown strains , on the beauty of Miss Anne . 
`` I shall escape , at any rate , '' said Nina . 
Now look out , Nina ! '' 
said Anne , tapping Nina with her fan . 
`` Dulcimer is evidently laying out his strength upon you , Nina ! '' 
And the response , `` No , boy , you are mistaken ; ' T is her rings of curly hair ! '' 
`` O , '' said Nina , `` yes , it must be ! 
`` O , how delightful , '' said Nina , `` this fragrance of the honeysuckles ! 
said Nina , in a tone of surprise . 
said Nina . 
`` That 's the kind of man youought to have for a lover , Anne , '' said Nina , laughing ; `` you have weight enough to risk it . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` I should n't want to be a quarry-master 's wife . 
`` Ah , '' said Nina , `` if Icould keep him my slave ; but I 'm afraid he 'd outwit me at last . 
You men are a bad set , '' said Nina . 
Wouldthe limits of our story admit of it , we should gladly linger many days in the shady precincts of Magnolia Grove , where Clayton and Nina remained some days longer , and where the hours flew by on flowery feet ; but the inevitable time and tide , which wait for no man , wait not for the narrator . 
We must therefore say , in brief , that when the visit was concluded , Clayton accompanied Nina once more to Canema , and returned to the circle of his own duties . 
Nina returned to her own estate , with views somewhat chastened and modified by her acquaintance with Anne . 
Since the first of their friendship , Clayton had never officiously sought to interfere with the growth and development of Nina 's moral nature . 
He had sufficient sagacity to perceive that , unconsciously to herself , a deeper power of feeling , and a wider range of thought , was opening within her ; and he left the development of it to the same quiet forces which swell the rosebud and guide the climbing path of the vine . 
Simply and absolutely he lived his own life before her , and let hers alone ; and the power of his life therefore became absolute . 
A few mornings after her return , she thought that she would go out and inquire after the welfare of our old friend Tiff . 
Since her absence there had been evident improvement in Tiff 's affairs . 
At the moment when Nina rode up , Tiff was busy with his morning work in the garden . 
Tiff was sitting on the ground weeding one of his garden-beds , when he was surprised by the apparition of Nina on horseback coming up to the gate . 
`` Lord bress yer sweet face , Miss Nina ! '' 
Bress de Lord , Miss Nina , be so good as to get down and come in . 
said Nina . 
`` Laws , no , Miss Nina ! '' 
said Tiff , as with alacrity he obeyed her orders . 
`` Tomtit pretended to come with me , '' said Nina , as she looked round ; `` but he lagged behind by the brook to get some of those green grapes , and I suspect it 's the last I shall see of him . 
And Nina tripped lightly up the walk , now bordered on either side by china asters and marigolds , to where Fanny was standing bashfully in the door waiting for her . 
She had , also , what perhaps belongs to the sex , a capability of receiving the mysteries and proprieties of dress ; and Nina , as she stood on the threshold of the single low room , could not but be struck with the general air of refinement which characterized both it and its little mistress . 
`` Thank you , '' said Nina , as Fanny offered her the only chair the establishment afforded ; `` but I 'm going with Tiff out in the garden . 
`` Yes , Miss Nina , it 's mighty pleasant . 
`` Most likely , '' said Nina , cheerily . 
`` Lord bress you , Miss Nina , it makes everything go kind o ' easy . 
`` Certainly it is , '' said Nina . 
`` Why , Miss Nina , I studies upon dat ar out here in my garden . 
Now , Miss Nina , Tiff has his own thoughts , you know ; and Tiff says , ` pears like de Lord is creating de heaven and de earth all de time . 
Miss Nina , ` pears for all de world like as if dey was critters ! 
Laws , Miss Nina , dese yer tings makes Tiff laugh -- does so ! '' 
`` You are quite a philosopher , Tiff , '' said Nina . 
`` Laws , Miss Nina , I hopes not ! '' 
Laws , Miss Nina , I hope I a n't no sich ! '' 
said Nina . 
`` Well , '' said Tiff , `` Miss Nina , I hope I got something -- I do n't know fa ` rly how much ' t is . 
But , Miss Nina , it ` pears like as if you had come out here to instruct us ` bout dese yer tings . 
said Nina . 
`` Milly is a very nice woman , '' said Tiff , somewhat doubtfully ; `` but , Miss Nina , ` pears like I would rather have white teaching ; ` pears like I would rather have you , if it would n't be too much trouble . '' 
If you want to hear me read , I 'll read to you now , '' said Nina . 
Nina thought a moment . 
The great question of questions , so earnestly proposed to her ! 
The simple , childlike old soul hanging confidingly on her answer ! 
At last she said , with a seriousness quite unusual with her : `` Tiff , I think the best thing I can do is to read to you about our Saviour . 
Perhaps , '' she added , with a sigh , `` I shall , too ! '' 
As she spoke , a sudden breeze of air shook the clusters of a prairie-rose , which was climbing into the tree under which she was sitting , and a shower of rose-leaves fell around her . 
`` Yes , '' she said to herself , as the rose-leaves fell on her book , `` it 's quite true , what he says . 
But Nina was reading to children , and to an old child-man , in whose grotesque and fanciful nature there was yet treasured a believing sweetness , like the amulets supposed to belong to the good genii of the fairy tales . 
Nina found it necessary to tranquillize the good creature , to get a hearing for the rest of the story . 
She went on reading of the wild night-journey of the wise men , and how the star went before them till it stood over the place where the child was . 
`` And dat ar chile was de Lord of glory , sure ` nough , Miss Nina ! 
Nina had never realized , till she felt it in the undoubting faith of her listeners , the wild , exquisite poetry of that legend , which , like an immortal lily , blooms in the heart of Christianity as spotless and as tender now as eighteen hundred years ago . 
When Nina had finished her reading , she found her own heart touched by the effect which she had produced . 
As Nina was mounting her horse to return , Tiff brought out a little basket full of wild raspberries . 
Proud and happy was Tiff , and , pulling down the very topmost cluster of his rose , he presented it to her . 
before Nina reached home , it hung drooping from the heat . 
While life to Nina was daily unfolding in brighter colors , the slave-brother at her side was destined to feel an additional burden on his already unhappy lot . 
In a moment there rose up before his mind the picture of Nina in all her happiness and buoyancy -- in all the fortunate accessories in her lot . 
She has been a good wife , and a good mother . 
Her husband has done all he could to save her ; but the cruel hand of the law grasps her and her children , and hurls them back into the abyss from which it was his life-study to raise them . 
After his return home it was with the sensation of chill at his heart that he heard Aunt Nesbit reading to Nina portions of a letter , describing the march through some Northern cities of the cholera , which was then making fearful havoc on our American shore . 
In the hazy , slumberous stillness of that midsummer atmosphere , in the long , silent rides through the pines , Nina half awakened from the thoughtless dreams of childhood , yearning for something nobler than she yet had lived for , thought over , and revolved in her mind , this beautiful and spotless image of God , revealed in man , which her daily readings presented ; and the world that he created seemed to whisper to her in every pulsation of its air , in every breath of its flowers , in the fanning of its winds , `` He still liveth , and he loveth thee . '' 
The voice of the Good Shepherd fell on the ear of the wandering lamb , calling her to his arms ; and Nina found herself one day unconsciously repeating , as she returned through the woods , words which she had often heard read at church : `` When thou saidst unto me , Seek ye my face , my heart said unto thee , Thy face , Lord , will I seek . '' 
Nina had often dreaded the idea of becoming a Christian , as one shrinks from the idea of a cold , dreary passage , which must be passed to gain a quiet home . 
But suddenly , as if by some gentle invisible hand , the veil seemed to be drawn which hid the face of Almighty Love from her view . 
She beheld the earth and the heavens transfigured in the light of his smile . 
A strange and unspeakable joy arose within her , as if some loving presence were always near her . 
It was with her when she laid down at night , and when she awoke in the morning the strange happiness had not departed . 
Her feelings may be best expressed by an extract from a letter which she wrote at this time to Clayton . 
To this letter Nina soon received an answer , from which also we give an extract : `` If I was so happy , my dearest one , as to be able to awaken that deeper and higher nature which I always knew was in you , I thank God . 
Do n't trouble your head , dear Nina , with Aunt Nesbit or Mr. Titmarsh . 
`` My dear father , '' he said , putting Nina 's note into his hand , `` you made allusion to Miss Gordon . 
When at length the dreaded news began to be heard from one point and another in their vicinity , Aunt Nesbit said , one day , to Nina , `` Your cousins , the Gordons , in E. , have written to us to leave the plantation , and come and spend some time with them , till the danger is over . '' 
`` Why , '' said Nina , `` do they think the cholera ca n't come there ? '' 
`` Aunt , '' said Nina , `` perhaps you had better go ; but I will stay with my people . '' 
`` Why , do n't you feel afraid , Nina ? '' 
`` No , aunt , I think there are some duties before that , '' said Nina . 
`` Harry , '' she said , `` if you 'll get up the carriage , we 'll go immediately . '' 
Again Harry felt the bitterness of his soul sweetened and tranquillized by the noble nature of her to whose hands the law had given the chain which bound him . 
Galling and intolerable as it would have been otherwise , he felt , when with her , that her service was perfect freedom . 
He had not said anything to Nina about the contents of the letter which he had received from his sister . 
Nina supposed that his clouded and troubled aspect was caused wholly by the solicitude of responsibility . 
In the same carriage which conveyed her to the town sat Aunt Nesbit also , and her cap-boxes , whose importance even the fear of the cholera could not lessen in her eyes . 
Nina found the physician quite au faiton the subject . 
He had been reading about miasma and animalculæ , and he entertained Nina nearly half an hour with different theories as to the cause of the disease , and with the experiments which had been made in foreign hospitals . 
Among the various theories , there was one which appeared to be his particular pet ; and Nina could n't help thinking , as he stepped about so alertly , that he almost enjoyed the prospect of putting his discoveries to the test . 
By dint , however , of very practical and positive questions , Nina drew from him all the valuable information which he had to give her ; and he wrote her a very full system of directions , and put up a case of medicines for her , assuring her that he should be happy to attend in person if he had time . 
On the way home , Nina stopped at Uncle John Gordon 's plantation , and there had the first experience of the difference between written directions for a supposed case , and the actual awful realities of the disease . 
Her Uncle John had been seized only half an hour before , in the most awful manner . 
`` Harry , '' said Nina , `` take out one of the carriagehorses , and ride quick for your life , and bring the doctor over here in a minute ! '' 
She then walked up to the distracted servants , and commanded them , in a tone of authority , to cease their lamentations . 
Her resolute manner , and the quiet tone of voice which she preserved , acted as a sedative on their excited nerves . 
She banished all but two or three of the most reasonable from the house , and then went to the assistance of her aunt . 
When he had been in the sick room a few moments , he came out to make some inquiries of Nina , and she could not help contrasting the appalled and confounded expression of his countenance with the dapper , consequential air , with which , only two hours before , he had been holding forth to her on animalcul æ and miasma . 
said Nina . 
Nina , poor flowery child of seventeen summers , stood with the rest in mute despair . 
When the breath had passed , and all was over , Nina could scarcely believe that that altered face and form , so withered and so worn , could have been her healthy and joyous uncle , and who never had appeared healthier or more joyous than on that morning . 
But , as a person passing under the foam and spray of Niagara clings with blind confidence to a guide whom he feels , but can not see , Nina , in this awful hour , felt that she was not alone . 
The Redeemer , all-powerful over death and the grave , of whom she had been thinking so much , of late , seemed to her sensibly near . 
And it seemed to her as if a voice said to her , continually , `` Fear not , for I am with thee . 
Two or three of the house-servants also seemed to be struck in the same moment , and only the calmness and courage which Nina and her aunt maintained prevented a general abandonment to panic . 
Nina possessed that fine , elastic temperament which , with the appearance of extreme delicacy , possesses great powers of endurance . 
The perfect calmness which she felt enabled her to bring all her faculties to bear on the emergency . 
Bring out your religion ; trust in God , '' she said , to the cook , who was wringing her hands in terror . 
There is a magic power in the cheerful tone of courage , and Nina succeeded in rallying the well ones to take care of the sick ; but now came a messenger , in hot haste , to say that the cholera had broken out on the plantation at home . 
`` Well , Harry , '' said Nina , with a face pale , yet unmoved , `` our duty calls us away . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Nina , putting her head out of the carriage . 
`` God , '' said Nina ; `` I am not afraid ! '' 
`` Now , Harry , '' said Nina , `` everything depends upon our keeping up our courage and our strength . 
`` O , Miss Nina , you are an angel ! '' 
said Harry , who felt at that moment as if he could have worshipped her . 
Arrived at home , Nina found a scene of terror and confusion similar to that she had already witnessed . 
Nina rode up immediately to the group . 
She spoke to them calmly ; she silenced their outcries , and bade them obey her . 
`` If you wish , all of you , to die , '' she said , `` this is the way towards it ; but , if you 'll keep quiet and calm , and do what ought to be done , your lives may be saved . 
Nina immediately went to the house , and instructed Milly , Aunt Rose , and two or three of the elderly women , in the duties to be done . 
She possessed a peculiar voice , suited to her large development of physical frame , almost as deep as a man 's bass , with the rich softness of a feminine tone ; and Nina could now and then distinguish , as she was moving about the house or grounds , that triumphant tone , singing , The house that night presented the aspect of a beleaguered garrison . 
Nina and Milly had thrown open all the chambers ; and such as were peculiarly exposed to the disease , by delicacy of organization or tremulousness of nervous system , were allowed to take shelter there . 
Accordingly Nina retired to her room , but before she lay down she wrote to Clayton : `` We are all in affliction here , my dear friend . 
`` Living or dying , ever your own After writing this , Nina laid down and slept -- slept all night as quietly as if death and disease were not hanging over her head . 
In the morning she rose and dressed herself , and Milly , with anxious care , brought to her room some warm coffee and crackers , which she insisted on her taking before she left her apartment . 
said Nina . 
said Nina , in a tremulous voice . 
De older ones is going to have a little prayer-meeting after breakfast , as a sort of funeral to dem dat 's dead ; and , perhaps , Miss Nina , you 'd read us a chapter . '' 
`` Certainly I will , '' said Nina . 
There was a murmur of tenderness and admiration as Nina , in a white morning-wrapper , and a cheek as white , came into the room . 
`` Sit down , all my friends , '' she said , `` sit down , '' looking at some of the plantation-men , who seemed to be diffident about taking the sofa , which was behind them ; `` it 's no time for ceremony now . 
Sing , '' she said . 
When the singing was over , Nina , in a tremulous voice , which grew clearer as she went on , read the undaunted words of the ancient psalm : `` He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty . 
`` It is possible , '' said Nina , `` that we may , some of us , be called away . 
In the afternoon of the second day , as Nina was sitting in the door , she observed the wagon of Uncle Tiff making its way up the avenue ; and , with her usual impulsiveness , ran down to meet her humble friend . 
`` O , Miss Nina , '' said the faithful creature , removing his hat , with habitual politeness , `` ef yer please , I 's brought de baby here , 'cause it 's drefful sick , and I 's been doing all I could for him , and he do n't get no better . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` you have come to a sorrowful place , for they are dying here , too ! 
`` Yes , Miss Nina , it 's ` sleep pretty much all de time , now . '' 
Nina carried it up the steps , and put it into the arms of Milly . 
`` Well , '' said Nina , `` we 'll help him take care of it , and we 'll make room for him and the children , Milly ; because we have medicines and directions , and they have nothing out there . '' 
Tiff held it in his arms to the very last ; and it was with difficulty that Nina and Milly could persuade him that the little flickering breath was gone forever . 
Nina quietly opened her Testament , and read to him : `` And they brought little children unto him , that he should touch them ; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them . 
Themails in the State of North Carolina , like the prudential arrangements in the slave states generally , were very little to be depended upon ; and therefore a week had elapsed after the mailing of Nina 's first letter , describing the danger of her condition , before it was received by Clayton . 
Nina had risen in the morning early , as her custom had been since the sickness , and gone the rounds , to inquire for the health of her people . 
Returned , a little fatigued , she was sitting in the veranda , under the shadow of one of the pillar-roses , enjoying the cool freshness of the morning . 
Suddenly the tramp of horse 's feet was heard , and , looking , she saw Clayton coming up the avenue . 
`` No , dear , not yet , '' said Nina . 
`` That 's not wonderful , '' said Nina ; `` I 've had a great deal to make me look pale ; but I am very well . 
`` No , '' said Nina , `` I think that when we have no one but our Father to lean on , he comes nearer than he does any other time ; and that is the secret of this happiness . 
`` Well , perhaps that was the best , '' said Nina ; `` because I have heard them say that anybody coming suddenly and unprepared in the epidemic , when it is in full force , is almost sure to be taken by it immediately . 
He thought that he was again with Nina at Magnolia Grove , and that the servants were passing around in procession , throwing flowers at their feet ; but the wreath of orange-blossoms which fell in Nina 's lap was tied with black crape . 
But she took it up , laughing , threw the crape away , and put the wreath on her head , and he heard the chorus singing , `` O , de North Carolina rose ! 
The rays of the evening sun were shining on the tree-tops of the distant avenue , and Nina was singing on the veranda below . 
`` Tea has been waiting for some time , '' said Nina . 
said Nina ; `` why , I did n't know it ! 
said Nina . 
And , as she stood looking up into the sky , she began singing again the words that Clayton had heard before : `` I am come from the happy land , Where sorrow is unknown ; I have parted a joyous band , To make thee mine own ! 
`` There 's no use in sending , '' said Nina ; `` he is driven to death , and ca n't come . 
He had been much affected by the last charge given him by Nina , that he should care for her people ; and the scene of distress which he witnessed among them , at her death , added to the strength of his desire to be of service to them . 
He spent some time in looking over and arranging Nina 's papers . 
He sealed up the letters of her different friends , and directed them in order to be returned to the writers , causing Harry to add to each a memorandum of the time of her death . 
He recalled , too , what Nina had said of the special bitterness existing between Tom and Harry ; and his heart almost failed him when he recollected that the very step which Nina , in her generosity , had taken to save Lisette from his lawlessness , had been the means of placing her , without remedy , under his power . 
Recollecting that Nina had said something of some kind of a contract , by which Harry 's freedom was to be secured in case of her death , he resolved to speak with him on the subject . 
`` I can bring witnesses to prove Mr. John Gordon 's signature , and Miss Nina 's also . '' 
He had written in advance to his parents of the death of Nina , and had begged them to spare him any conversation on that subject ; and , therefore , on his first meeting with his mother and father , there was that painful blank , that heavy dulness of suffering , which comes when people meet together , feeling deeply on one absorbing subject , which must not be named . 
He remembered the note Nina had written him on the day of the decision , and thought what a brave-hearted little creature she was ; and , like the faint breath of a withered rose , the shadowy remembrance of her seemed to say to him , `` Go on ! '' 
Miss Fanny grew healthy and strong , and spent many long sunny hours wandering in the woods with Teddy ; or , sitting out on the bench where Nina had been wont to read to them , would spell out with difficulty , for her old friend 's comfort and enlightenment , the half-familiar words of the wondrous story that Nina had brought to their knowledge . 
Por , dear Miss Nina , dat was a doing for de chil ` en ! 
she 's gone up among de angels ! 
I 's minding dat I 'd better speak to Miss Nina 's man ` bout dese yer chil ` en ; 'cause he 's a nice , perty man , and nat ` rally he 'd take an interest ; and dat ar handsome sister of his , dat was so thick wid Miss Nina , maybe she 'd be doing something for her . 
And Miss Nina 's dead , and dere a n't no place for you to go ! '' 
`` Tiff , does marrying father make her our ma ? '' 
And now , Lord , ' says I , ` you musthelp us , 'cause we a n't got no place else to go ; 'cause , you know , Miss Nina she 's dead , and Mr. John Gordon , too ! 
`` Do n't you know de story Miss Nina read to you , once , how de angel of de Lord ` peared to Hagar in de wilderness , when she was sitting down under de bush . 
Do n't you mind Miss Nina was reading dat ar de bery last Sunday she come to our place ? 
Bress de Lord for sending her to us ! 
I 's going to sit up for to meditate -- a ` sidering on de fowls of de air , and de lilies in de field , and all dem dar Miss Nina used to read ` bout . '' 
By some singular association , this stranger , with a serious , radiant face , suggested to him the sparkling , glittering beauty of Nina ; and it seemed , for a moment , as if Nina was fluttering by him in the air , and passing away after her . 
When he examined the emotion more minutely afterwards , he thought , perhaps , it might have been suggested by the perception , as he lifted the glove , of a peculiar and delicate perfume , which Nina was fond of using . 
After Clayton had left the place , he often pondered the dying words of Nina , `` that he should care for her people ; that he should tell Tom to be kind to them . '' 
Clayton thought within himself that it was utterly hopeless to expect any good arising from the sending of Nina 's last message . 
Clayton saw again in the minister what he had seen in Nina -- a soul swayed by an attachment to an invisible person , whose power over it was the power of a personal attachment , and who swayed it , not by dogmas or commands , merely , but by the force of a sympathetic emotion . 
Laws , we did n't know what privileges we had when we had Miss Nina ! 
Seated on the cabin-floor , with his feet firmly braced , he would hold the children in his arms , and remind them of what Miss Nina had read to them of the storm that came down on the Lake of Gennesareth , and how Jesus was in the hinder part of the boat , asleep on a pillow . 
Anne Clayton , on a visit to a friend 's family in New Hampshire , met with Livy Ray , of whom she had heard Nina speak so much , and very naturally the two ladies fell into a most intimate friendship ; visits were exchanged between them , and Clayton , on first introduction , discovered the lady he had met in the prison in Alexandria .
