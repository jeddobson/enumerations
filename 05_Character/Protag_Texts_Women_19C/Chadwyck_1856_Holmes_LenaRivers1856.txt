Here for several months young Rivers devoted himself entirely to her happiness , seeming to forget that there was aught else in the world save his `` beautiful ` Lena , '' as he was wo n't to call her . 
Carefully did Mrs. Nichols nurse him , watching , weeping , and praying that he might live , while little ` Lena gladly shared her grandmother 's vigils , hovering ever by the bedside of her grandfather , who seemed more quiet when her soft hand smoothed his tangled hair , or wiped the cold moisture from his brow . 
Several times had ` Lena written to her uncle , apprising him of his father 's danger , and once only had he answered . 
It was a brief , formal letter , written , evidently , under some constraint , but it said that he was coming , and with childish joy the old man had placed it beneath his pillow , withdrawing it occasionally for ` Lena to read again , particularly the passage , `` Dear father , I am sorry you are sick . '' 
Never but once had they asked for aid , and that to help them rear the little ` Lena . 
This letter ` Lena had accidentally found among her grandfather 's papers , and though its contents gave her no definite impression concerning her mother , it inspired her with a dislike for her uncle , whose coming she greatly dreaded , for it was confidently expected that she , together with her grandmother , would return with him to Kentucky . 
`` You 'll be better off there than here , '' said her grandfather one day , when speaking of the subject . 
`` I do n't want to be a lady -- I wo n't be a lady , '' said ` Lena passionately . 
The next moment ` Lena was bending over her grandfather , asking to be forgiven for the hasty words which she knew had caused him pain . 
`` I 'll try to like him , '' said she , as the palsied hand stroked her disordered curls in token of forgiveness , `` I 'll try to like him ; '' adding mentally , `` but I do hope he wo n't come . '' 
It would seem that ` Lena 's wish was to be granted , for weeks glided by and there came no tidings of the absent one . 
`` ` Lena , '' said Mrs. Nichols one afternoon when her husband seemed worse , `` ` Lena , it 's time for the stage , and do you run down to the ` turn ' and see if your uncle 's come ; something tells me he 'll be here to-night . '' 
` Lena obeyed , and throwing on her faded calico sun-bonnet , she was soon at the `` turn , '' a point in the road from which the village hotel was plainly discernible . 
The stage had just arrived , and ` Lena saw that one of the passengers evidently intended stopping , for he seemed to be giving directions concerning his baggage . 
`` That 's Uncle John , I most know , '' thought she , and seating herself on a rock beneath some white birches , so common in New England , she awaited his approach . 
She was right in her conjecture , for the stranger was John Livingstone , returned after many years , but so changed that the jolly landlord , who had known him when a boy , and with whom he had cracked many a joke , now hardly dared to address him , he seemed so cold and haughty . 
With a gesture of impatience Mr. Livingstone left the house and started up the mountain road , where ` Lena still kept her watch . 
From her seat on the mossy rock ` Lena had been watching him . 
She was very ardent and impulsive , strong in her likes and dislikes , but quite ready to change the latter if she saw any indications of improvement in the person disliked . 
For her uncle she had conceived a great aversion , and when she saw him approaching , thrusting aside the thistles and dandelions with his gold-headed cane , she mimicked his motions , wondering `` if he did n't feel big because he wore a large gold chain dangling from his jacket pocket . '' 
But when she saw his emotions beneath the walnut tree , her opinion suddenly changed . 
`` A very bad man would n't cry , '' she thought , and springing to his side , she grasped his hand , exclaiming , `` I know you are my Uncle John , and I 'm real glad you 've come . 
Had his buried sister ar sen before him , Mr. Livingstone would hardly have been more startled , for in form and feature ` Lena was exactly what her mother had been at her age . 
The same clear complexion , large brown eyes , and wavy hair ; and the tones of her voice , too , how they thrilled the heart of the strong man , making him a boy again , guiding the steps of his baby sister , or bearing her gently in his arms when the path was steep and stony . 
Glancing at the old-womanish garb in which Mrs. Nichols always arrayed her , a smile of mingled scorn and pity curled his lip , as he thought of presenting her to his fastidious wife and elegant daughters ; then withdrawing the hand which she had taken , he said , `` And you are ` Lena -- ` Lena Nichols they call you , I suppose . '' 
` Lena 's old dislike began to return , and placing both hands upon her hips in imitation of her grandmother , she replied , `` No ` tai n't ` Lena Nichols , neither . 
Poor little ` Lena ! 
how should she know any better , living as she always had with two old people , whose language savored so much of the days before the flood ! 
Some such thought passed through Mr. Livingstone 's mind , and very civilly he answered her concerning the health of her cousins and aunt ; proceeding next to question her of his father , who , she said , `` had never seen a well day since her mother died . '' 
asked Mr. Livingstone ; and ` Lena replied , `` Aunt Nancy Scovandyke has been with us a few days , and is there now . '' 
At the sound of that name John started , coloring so deeply that ` Lena observed it , and asked `` if he knew Miss Scovandyke ? '' 
`` I used to , '' said he , while ` Lena continued : `` She 's a nice woman , and though she ai n't any connection , I call her aunt . 
` Lena blushed painfully . 
'T was the first word she had ever uttered , her grandmother having taught it to her , and encouraged her in its use . 
Besides that , ` Lena had a great horror of anything which she fancied was at all `` stuck up , '' and thinking an entire change from Grannyto Grandmotherwould be altogether too much , she still persisted in occasionally using her favorite word , in spite of the ridicule it frequently called forth from her school companions . 
Thinking to herself that it was none of her uncle 's business what she called her grandmother , she made no reply , and in a few moments they came in sight of the yellow farm-house , which looked to Mr. Livingstone just as it did when he left it , eighteen years before . 
Mechanically he followed ` Lena into the yard , half expecting to see bleaching upon the grass the same web of home-made cloth , which he remembered had lain there when he went away . 
`` I should n't wonder if grandpa was worse , '' said ` Lena , hurrying him along and ushering him at once into the sick-room . 
He looked at ` Lena , shewas beautiful -- he knew that , but she was odd and old-fashioned . 
On the night of his arrival , she had been sent in quest of the physician , and when on her return she learned from ` Lena that he had come , she kept out of sight , thinking she would wait awhile before she met him . 
Mrs. Nichols saw he was decided , and forthwith ` Lena was dispatched to Widow Fisher 's , to see if she would take it at half price . 
` Lena , who was naturally quick-sighted , had partially divined the cause of her uncle 's moodiness . 
The more she saw of him the better she liked him , and she began to think that she would willingly try to cure herself of the peculiarities which evidently annoyed him , if he would only notice her a little , which he was not likely to do . 
He seldom noticed any child , much less little ` Lena , who he fancied was ignorant as well as awkward ; but he did not know her . 
One day when , as usual , he sat whittling and thinking , ` Lena approached him softly , and laying her hand upon his knee , said rather timidly , `` Uncle , I wish you 'd tell me something about my cousins . '' 
`` What about them , '' he asked , somewhat gruffly , for it grated upon his feelings to hear hisdaughters called cousin by her . 
`` I want to know how they look , and which one I shall like the best , '' continued ` Lena . 
`` You 'll like Anna the best , '' said her uncle ; and ` Lena asked , `` Why ? 
`` None too well , I reckon , '' returned her uncle , adding that `` there were not many little girls who did . '' 
`` Why Ido , '' said ` Lena , and her uncle , stopping for a moment his whittling , replied rather scornfully , `` You!I should like to know what you ever studied besides the spelling book ! '' 
` Lena reddened , for she knew that , whether deservedly or not , she bore the reputation of being an excellent scholar , for one of her age , and now she rather tartly answered , `` I study geography , arithmetic , grammar , and -- '' history , she was going to add , but her uncle stopped her , saying , `` That 'll do , that 'll do . 
`` Yes I do , said ` Lena , with a good deal of spirit . 
`` Why do n't you do it then , '' asked her uncle . 
said ` Lena , and her uncle continued , `` Why do n't you make some use of your boasted knowledge of grammar ? 
said ` Lena . 
`` Do n't talk like you do , '' repeated her uncle , while ` Lena 's eyes fairly danced with mischief as she asked , `` if that were good grammar . '' 
Mr. Livingston colored , thinking it just possible that he himself might sometimes be guilty of the same things for which he had so harshly chided ` Lena , of whom from this time he began to think more favorably . 
It could hardly be said that he treated her with any more attention , and still there was a difference which she felt , and which made her very happy . 
Summoning all her courage , she gave one last glance at the familiar objects around her , at the flowers she had planted , the trees she had reared , and then taking ` Lena 's hand , went down to the gate where her son was awaiting her . 
He saw she had been weeping , and though he could not appreciate the cause of her tears , in his heart he pitied her , and his voice and manner were unusually kind as he helped her to the best seat in the wagon , and asked if she were comfortable . 
Then his eye fell upon her dress , and his pity changed to anger as he wondered if she was wholly devoid of taste . 
At the time of his father 's death , he had purchased decent mourning for both his mother and ` Lena ; but these Mrs. Nichols pronounced `` altogether too good for the nasty cars ; nobody 'd think any better of them for being rigged out in their very best meetin ' gowns . '' 
Unlike her grandmother 's , ` Lena 's dress was a great deal too long , and as she never wore pantalets , she had the look of a premature old woman , instead of a child ten summer 's old , as she was . 
In the doorway stood Miss Nancy , and by her side her nephew , Joel Slocum , a freckled face boy , who had frequently shown a preference for ` Lena , by going with her for her grandmother 's cow , bringing her harvest apples , and letting her ride on his sled oftener than the other girls at school . 
Strange to say , his affection was not returned , and now , notwithstanding he several times wiped both eyes and nose , on the end of which there was an enormous freck , ` Lena did not relent at all , but with a simple `` Good-by , Jo , '' she sprang into the wagon , which moved rapidly away . 
When Mrs. Nichols and ` Lena entered the cars , they of course attracted universal attention , which annoyed John excessively . 
Among these was a fine-looking youth , fifteen or sixteen years of age , who sat directly in front of ` Lena . 
Thinking he had now found it in a rich form , he turned partly round , and would undoubtedly have quizzed Mrs. Nichols unmercifully , had not something in the appearance of ` Lena prevented him . 
This was also her first ride in the cars , but she possessed a tact of concealing the fact , and if she sometimes felt frightened , she looked in the faces of those around her , gathering from them that there was no danger . 
She knew that her grandmother was making herself ridiculous , and her eyes filled with tears as she whispered , `` Do sit still , granny ; everybody is looking at you . '' 
The young lad noticed this , and while it quelled in him the spirit of ridicule , it awoke a strange interest in ` Lena , who he saw was beautiful , spite of her unseemly guise . 
She was a dear lover of nature , and as the cars sped on through the wild mountain scenery , between Pittsfield and Albany , she stood at the open window , her hands closely locked together , her lips slightly parted , and her eyes wide with wonder at the country through which they were passing . 
At her grandmother 's suggestion she had removed her bonnet , and the brown curls which clustered around her white forehead and neck were moved up and down by the fresh breeze which was blowing . 
Quick as thought his hand sought the brown curls , but they were gone , and when the cars again emerged into daylight , ` Lena 's arms were around her grandmother 's neck , trying to hold her down ; for the old lady , sure of a smash-upthis time , had attempted to rise , screaming loudly for `` John ! '' 
The boy laughed aloud -- he could not help it ; but when ` Lena 's eyes turned reprovingly upon him , he felt sorry ; and anxious to make amends , addressed himself very politely to Mrs. Nichols , explaining to her that it was a `` tunnel '' through which they had passed , and assuring her there was no danger whatever . 
Then turning to ` Lena , he said , `` I reckon your grandmother is not much accustomed to traveling . '' 
`` No , sir , '' answered ` Lena , the rich blood dyeing her cheek at being addressed by a stranger . 
Nothing from ` Lena except a slight straightening up of her body , and a smoothing down of her dress , but the ice was broken , and erelong she and her companion were conversing as familiarly as if they had known each other for years . 
Still the boy was not inquisitive -- he did not ask her name , or where she was going , though he told her that his home was in Louisville , and that at Albany he was to take the boat for New York , where his mother was stopping with some friends . 
Glancing toward the person indicated , ` Lena saw that it was the same gentleman who , all the afternoon , had been talking with her uncle . 
He was noble looking , and she felt glad that he was the father of the boy -- he was just such a man , she fancied , as ought to be his father -- just such a man as she could wish herfather to be -- and then ` Lena felt glad that the youth had asked her nothing concerning her parentage , for , though her grandmother had seldom mentioned her father in her presence , there were others ready and willing to inform her that he was a villain , who broke her mother 's heart . 
When they reached Albany , the boy rose , and offering his hand to ` Lena , said , `` I suppose I must bid you good-by , but I 'd like right well to go farther with you . '' 
The stranger 's eyes fell upon ` Lena 's face , and for a moment , as if by some strange fascination , seemed riveted there ; but the crowd pressed him forward , and ` Lena only heard him reply to his son , `` Yes , Durward , very pretty ; but hurry , or we shall lose the boat . '' 
Leaning from the window , ` Lena tried to catch another glimpse of him , but in vain . 
He was gone -- she would never see him again , she thought ; and then she fell into a reverie concerning his home , his mother , his sisters , if he had any , and finally ended by wishing that she were his sister , and the daughter of his father . 
While she was thus pondering , her grandmother , also , was busy , and when ` Lena looked round for her she was gone . 
Stepping from the car , ` Lena espied her in the distance , standing by her uncle and anxiously watching for the appearance of her `` great trunk , little trunk , band-box , and bag . '' 
`` Do sit down , '' said ` Lena ; `` the other people do n't seem to be afraid , and I 'm sure we need n't . '' 
I had n't but fivedollars in my purse ; t ` other fifty I sewed up in an old night-gown sleeve , and tucked it away in that sachel up there , '' pointing to ` Lena 's traveling bag , which hung over her head . 
She would undoubtedly have designated the very corner of said sachel in which her money could be found , had not her son touched her shoulder , bidding her be silent and not tell everybody where her money was , if she did n't want it stolen . 
Instinctively ` Lena shrank from him , and withdrawing herself as far as possible within the recess of the window , pretended to be busily watching the passers by . 
But she did not escape his notice , and after coolly surveying her for a moment , he walked up to her , saying , `` How d'ye , polywog ? 
`` None of your business , '' was ` Lena 's ready answer . 
It 's my own head , and you just let it alone , '' returned Lena , growing more and more indignant , and wondering if this were a specimen of Kentucky boys . 
`` Do n't be saucy , '' continued her tormentor ; `` I only want to see what sort of stuff you are made of . '' 
`` Made of dirt , '' muttered ` Lena . 
`` I came from Massachusetts , and I live with granny , '' said ` Lena , thinking that if she answered him civilly , he would perhaps let her alone . 
But she was mistaken . 
Feeling sure that not only herself but all her relations were included in this insult , ` Lena darted forward , hitting him a blow in the face , which he returned by puffing smoke into hers , whereupon she snatched the cigar from his mouth and hurled it into the street , bidding him `` touch her again if he dared . '' 
It would be difficult to describe the amazement of John Jr. when ` Lena was presented to him as his cousin , and Mrs. Nichols as his grandmother.Something which sounded very much like an oath escaped his lips , as turning to his father he muttered , `` Wo n't mother go into fits ? '' 
` Lena began to tremble for her future happiness , if that boy was to live in the same house with her . 
She did not know that she had already more than half won his good opinion , for he was far better pleased with her antagonistical demonstrations , than he would have been had she cried or ran from him , as his sister Anna generally did when he teased her . 
After a few moments he returned to the parlor , and walking up to Mrs. Nichols , commenced talking very sociably with her , calling her `` Granny , '' and winking slily at ` Lena as he did so . 
So moving away from her , he took a seat near ` Lena , telling her her dress was `` a heap too short , '' and occasionally pinching her , just to vary the sport ! 
This last , however , ` Lena returned with so much force that he grew weary of the fun , and informing her that he was going to a circuswhich was in town that evening , he arose to leave the room . 
`` ` Lena , where did he say he was going ? '' 
asked her uncle . 
` Lena trembled , for John Jr. had clinched his fist , and was shaking it threateningly at her . 
Poor ` Lena had never told a lie in her life , and now , braving her cousin 's anger , she said , `` To the circus , sir . 
Much as John Jr. frightened ` Lena with his threats , in his heart he respected her for telling the truth , and if the next morning on their way home in the stage , in which his father compelled him to take a seat , he frequently found it convenient to step on her feet , it was more from a natural propensity to torment than from any lurking feeling of revenge . 
` Lena was nowise backward in returning his cousinly attentions , and so between an interchange of kicks , wry faces , and so forth , they proceeded toward `` Maple Grove , '' a description of which will be given in another chapter . 
Altogether , it was as ` Lena said , `` just the kind of place which one reads of in stories , '' and which is often found at the `` sunny south . '' 
All this had likewise been told to Anna , the youngest daughter , who was about ` Lena 's age , but upon her it made no impression . 
If her father were once poor , he was in her opinion none the worse for that -- and if heliked his parents , that was a sufficient reason why she should like them too , and if little ` Lena was an orphan , she pitied her , and hoped she might sometime see her and tell her so ! 
When her husband first wrote to her that his father was dead , and that he had promised to take charge of his mother and ` Lena , she flew into a violent rage , which was increased ten-fold when she received his second letter , wherein he announced his intention of bringing them home in spite of her . 
Bursting into tears , she declared `` she 'd leave the house before she 'd have it filled up with a lot of paupers . 
It 'll be so nice to have grandma and cousin ` Lena so near me . '' 
`` Do n't talk , granny , '' whispered ` Lena , painfully conscious of the curious eyes fixed upon them by the bevy of blacks , who had come out to greet their master , and who , with sidelong glances at each other , were inspecting the new comers . 
The moment ` Lena came in sight , Mrs. Livingstone exclaimed , `` Oh , mercy , which is the oldest ? '' 
and truly , poor ` Lena did present a sorry figure . 
Her bonnet , never very handsome or fashionable , had received an ugly crook in front , which neither her grandmother or uncle had noticed , and of which John Jr. would not tell her , thinking that the worse she looked the more fun he would have ! 
Behind them was John Jr. , mimicking first ` Lena 's gait and then his grandmother 's . 
Then dropping into the wooden rocking chair and laying aside her bonnet , she for the first time noticed that ` Lena was not with her , and asked Corinda to go for her . 
Corinda complied , leaving the room just in time to stifle a laugh , as she saw Mrs. Nichols stoop down to examine the hearth-rug , wondering `` how much it cost when ' t was new . '' 
We left ` Lena standing on the steps of the piazza . 
At a glance she had taken in the whole -- had comprehended that there was no affinity whatever between herself and the objects around her , and a wild , intense longing filled her heart to be once more among her native hills . 
This was too much for ` Lena . 
She already disliked John Jr. , and now , flying into a violent passion , she drew off her shoes , and hurling them at the young gentleman 's head , fled away , away , she knew not , cared not whither , so that she got out of sight and hearing . 
Coming at last to the arbor bridge across the brook in the garden , she paused for breath , and throwing herself upon a seat , burst into a flood of tears . 
For several minutes she sobbed so loudly that she did not hear the sound of footsteps upon the graveled walk . 
Going up to her she said , `` Do n't cry so , ` Lena . 
` Lena had not yet recovered from her angry fit , and thinking Anna only came to tease her , and perhaps again ridicule her bonnet , she tore the article from her head , and bending it up double , threw it into the stream , which carried it down to the fish-pond , where for two or three hours it furnished amusement for some little negroes , who , calling it a crab , fished for it with hook and line ! 
For a moment Anna stood watching the bonnet as it sailed along down the stream , thinking it looked better there than on its owner 's head , but wondering why ` Lena had thrown it away . 
Then again addressing her cousin , she asked why she had done so ? 
`` It 's a homely old thing , and I hate it , '' answered ` Lena , again bursting into tears . 
With her impressions of the `` Bay State , '' where her mother said folks lived on `` cold beans and codfish , '' Anna thought sheshould prefer the first alternative , but she did not say so ; and after a little she tried again to comfort ` Lena , telling her `` she liked her , or at least she was going to like her a heap . '' 
`` No , you ai n't , '' returned ` Lena . 
She had no scholarship of which to boast ; but she had a heart brim full of love , and in reply to ` Lena 's accusation of having laughed at her , she replied , `` I know I laughed , for grandma looked so funny I could n't help it . 
This made ` Lena cry again , while Anna continued : `` Pa 'll buy you some new clothes I reckon , and if he do n't I 'll give you some of mine , for I 've got heaps , and they 'll fit you I most know . 
` Lena complied , and to Anna 's great joy they were just of a height . 
`` I 'm so glad , '' said she . 
Hand-in-hand the two girls started for the house , but had not gone far when they heard some one calling , `` Ho , Miss ` Lena , whar is you ? 
At the same time Corinda made her appearance round the corner of the piazza . 
With a broad grin Corinda followed her young mistress , while ` Lena , never having been accustomed to any negro save the one with whom many New England children are threatened when they cry , clung closer to Anna 's side , occasionally casting a timid glance toward the dark-browed girl who followed them . 
In the upper hall they met with Carrie , who in passing ` Lena held back her dress , as if fearing contamination from a contact with her cousin 's plainer garments . 
Painfully alive to the slightest insult , ` Lena reddened , while Anna said , `` Never mind -- that 's just like Cad , but nobody cares for her . '' 
Thus reässured ` Lena followed on , until they reached Anna 's room , which they were about to enter , when the shrill voice of Mrs. Nichols fell upon their ears , calling , `` ` Leny , ` Leny , where upon airth is she ? '' 
`` Let 's go to her first , '' said ` Lena , and leading the way , Anna soon ushered her into her grandmother 's room , which , child as she was , ` Lena readily saw was far different from the handsome apartments of which she had obtained a passing glance . 
Her grandmother 's first remark , however , struck her still more forcibly , and she immediately asked , `` Grandma , what did you call ` Lena , just now ? 
` Lena what ? '' 
`` I called her by her name , ` Lena Rivers . 
What should I call her ? '' 
`` Why , I thought her name was ` Lena Nichols ; ma said 't was , '' answered Anna . 
Mrs. Nichols was very sensitive to any slight cast upon ` Lena 's birth , and she rather tartly informed Anna , that `` her mother did n't know everything , '' adding that `` ` Lena 's father was Mr. Rivers , and there was n't half so much reason why she should be called Nichols as there was why Anna should , for that was her father 's name , the one by which he was baptized , the same day with Nancy Scovandyke , who 's jest his age , only he was born about a quarter past four in the morning , and she not till some time in the afternoon ! '' 
This silenced Anna , and satisfied her , too , that there was some mystery connected with ` Lena , which she must not try to penetrate . 
The mention of Nancy Scovandyke reminded Mrs. Nichols of the dishes which that lady had packed away , and anxious to see if they were safe , she turned to ` Lena , saying , `` I guess we 'll have time before dinner to unpack my trunks , for I want to know how the crockery stood the racket . 
In her eagerness to know what those weather-beaten boxes contained , Anna forgot her scheme of dressing ` Lena , and ran down , not to call her father , but the black boy , Adam . 
It took her a long time to find him , and Mrs. Nichols , growing impatient , determined to go herself , spite of ` Lena 's entreaties that she would stay where she was . 
Passing down the long stairway , and out upon the piazza , she espied a negro girl on her hands and knees engaged in cleaning the steps with a cloth . 
Instantly remembering her mop , she greatly lamented that she had left it behind -- `` ` twould come so handy now , '' thought she , but there was no help for it . 
Have you seen ` Lena ? '' 
`` No , neither do I wish to , if she 's at all like her grandmother , '' answered Mrs. Livingstone . 
`` She 's handsome , '' suggested Mr. Livingstone . 
repeated his wife , scornfully , while he replied , `` Yes , handsomer than either of our daughters , and with the same advantages , I 've no doubt she 'd surpass them both . '' 
`` Those advantages , then , she shall never have , '' returned Mrs. Livingstone , already jealous of a child she had only seen at a distance . 
Mr. Livingstone made no reply , but felt that he 'd made a mistake in praising ` Lena , in whom he began to feel a degree of interest for which he could not account . 
He did not know that way down in the depths of his heart , calloused over as it was by worldly selfishness , there was yet a tender spot , a lingering memory of his only sister , whom ` Lena so strongly resembled . 
You 've hit her this time , granny , '' exclaimed John Jr. , snapping his fingers under Carrie 's nose , which being rather long , was frequently a subject of his ridicule . 
`` Let me be , John Livingstone , '' said Carrie , while ` Lena resolved never again to use the word `` granny , '' which she knew her cousin had taken up on purpose to tease her . 
`` Come , ` Lena , catch hold and help me untie this rope . 
I b ` lieve the crockery 's in here , '' said Mrs. Nichols to ` Lena , who soon opened the chest , disclosing to view as motley a variety of articles as is often seen . 
Among the rest was the `` blue set , '' a part of her `` setting out , '' as his grandmother told John Jr. , at the same time dwelling at length upon their great value . 
Mistaking Carrie 's look of contempt for envy , Mrs. Nichols chucked her under the chin , telling her `` May be there was something for her , if she was a good girl . '' 
`` Where does your marm keep her china ? 
`` Here 's a nice little cupboard over the fire-place ; I 'd put them here , '' said ` Lena . 
The dishes were put away in the cupboard , ` Lena thinking that with all his badness John Jr. , was of some use after all . 
At last , tired of looking on , Anna suggested to ` Lena , who did not seem to be helping matters forward much , that she should go and be dressed up as had been first proposed . 
Readily divining her sister 's intention , Carrie ran with it to her mother , who sent back word that `` ` Lena must mind her own affairs , and let Anna 's dresses alone ! '' 
This undeserved thrust made ` Lena cry , while Anna declared `` her mother never said any such thing , '' which Carrie understood as an insinuation that she had told a falsehood . 
Accordingly a quarrel of words ensued between the two sisters , which was finally quelled by John Jr. , who called to Carrie `` to come down , as she 'd got a letter from Durward Bellmont . '' 
How that name made ` Lena 's heart leap ! 
Was it herDurward -- the boy in the cars ? 
` Lena made no direct reply , for much as she would like to see her compagnon du voyage , she felt an unwillingness to meet him in the presence of Carrie , who she knew would spare no pains to mortify her . 
Soon forgetting Durward , Anna again alluded to her plan of dressing ` Lena , wishing `` Cad would mind her own business . '' 
Then , as a new idea entered her head , she brightened up , exclaiming , `` I know what I can do . 
` Lena offered no remonstrance , and Corinda , who came at the call of her young mistress , immediately commenced brushing and curling the bright , wavy hair which Anna had rightly called beautiful . 
Scarcely had she reached her room when the dinner-bell rang , every note falling like an ice-bolt on the heart of ` Lena , who , though hungry like her grandmother , still greatly dreaded the dinner , fearing her inability to acquit herself creditably . 
Corinda had finished her hair , and Anna , looking over her wardrobe and coming upon the black dress which her father had purchased for her , had insisted upon ` Lena 's wearing it . 
It was of rather more modern make than any of her other dresses , and when her toilet was completed , she looked uncommonly well . 
Still she trembled violently as Anna led her to the dining-room . 
Except through the window , Mrs. Livingstone had not yet seen ` Lena , and now dropping into her chair , she never raised her eyes until Anna said , `` Mother , mother , this is ` Lena . 
Look at her . '' 
Thus importuned , Mrs. Livingstone looked up , and the frown with which she was prepared to greet her niece softened somewhat , for ` Lena was not a child to be looked upon and despised . 
Plain and humble as was her dress , there was something in her fine , open face , which at once interested and commanded respect . 
At a glance , she saw that ` Lena was beautiful , and that it was quite as much a beauty of intellect as of feature and form . 
`` Yes , '' thought she , `` husband was right when he said that , with the same advantages , she 'd soon outstrip her cousins -- but it shall never be -- never , '' and the white teeth shut firmly together , as the cold , proud woman bowed a welcome . 
Stimulated by the example of ` Lena , she , too , had changed her dress , and now in black bombasin , white muslin cap , and shining silk apron , she presented so respectable an appearance that her son 's face instantly brightened . 
`` Come , mother , we are waiting for you , '' said he , as she stopped on her way to ask Vine , the fly girl , `` how she did , and if it was n't hard work to swing them feathers . '' 
Taking her seat next to her son , Mrs. Nichols said , when offered a plate of soup , `` I do n't often eat broth ; besides that , I ai n't much hungry , as I 've just been takin ' a bite with Miss Atherton ! '' 
John Jr. roared , and was ordered from the table by his father , while Lena , who stepped on her grandmother 's toes to keep her from talking , was told by that lady `` to keep her fect still . '' 
Coming suddenly upon a group of young negroes , she discovered her bellows , the water dripping from the nose , while a little farther on she espied ` Lena 's bonnet , which the negroes had at last succeeded in catching , and which , wet as it was , now adorned the head of Thomas Jefferson ! 
`` I would n't do any such thing , '' said ` Lena , seeing at a glance how such a proposal would be received . 
asked Mrs. Nichols , and ` Lena replied , `` I do n't think Nancy would suit Aunt Livingstone at all , and besides that , they 've engaged a teacher , a Mr. Everett , and expect him next week . '' 
The latter ` Lena knew nothing about , but she replied that `` she believed he was from Rockford , a village near Rochester , New York . '' 
`` Very likely , '' returned ` Lena , catching her bonnet and hurrying off to ride with Captain Atherton and Anna . 
This made Anna exceedingly sensitive , and now when the captain called for her to ride , as he frequently did , she refused to go unless the invitation was also extended to ` Lena , who in this way got many a pleasant ride around the country . 
She was fast learning to like Kentucky , and would have been very happy had her aunt and Carrie been a little more gracious . 
But the former seldom spoke to her , and the latter only to ridicule something which she said or did . 
Many and amusing were the disputes between the two girls concerning their peculiarities of speech , Carrie bidding ` Lena `` quit her Yankee habit of eternally guessing , '' and ` Lena retorting that `` she would when Carrie stopped her everlasting reckoning . '' 
To avoid the remarks of the neighbors , who she knew were watching her narrowly , Mrs. Livingstone had purchased ` Lena two or three dresses , which , though greatly inferior to those worn by Carrie and Anna , were still fashionably made , and so much improved ` Lena 's looks , that her manners improved , also , for what child does not appear to better advantage when conscious of looking well ? 
More than once had her uncle 's hand rested for a moment on her brown curls , while his thoughts were traversing the past , and in fancy his fingers were again straying among the silken locks now resting in the grave . 
It would seem as if the mother from her coffin was pleading for her child , for all the better nature of Mr. Livingstone was aroused ; and when he secured the services of Mr. Everett , who was highly recommended both as a scholar and gentleman , he determined that ` Lena should share the same advantages with his daughters . 
To this Mrs. Livingstone made no serious objection , for as Mr. Everett would teach in the house , it would not do to debar ` Lena from the privilege of attending his school ; and as the highest position to which she could aspire was to be governess in some private family , she felt willing , she said , that she should have a chance of acquiring the common branches . 
Anna , who had no fondness for books , greatly dreaded his arrival , thinking within herself how many pranks she 'd play off upon him , provided ` Lena would lend a helping hand , which she much doubted . 
John Jr. , too , who for a time , at least , was to be placed under Mr. Everett 's instruction , felt in no wise eager for his arrival , fearing , as he told ` Lena , that `` between the ` old man ' and the tutor , he would be kept a little too straight for a gentleman of his habits ; '' and it was with no particular emotions of pleasure that he and Anna saw the stage stop before the gate one pleasant morning toward the middle of November . 
Running to one of the front windows , Carrie , ` Lena , and Anna watched their new teacher , each after her own fashion commenting upon his appearance . 
`` I like him , '' was ` Lena 's brief remark . 
With ` Lena and Anna he seemed better pleased , holding their hands and smiling down upon them through rows of teeth which Anna pronounced the whitest she had ever seen . 
`` You are from Rockford , ` Lena tells me ? '' 
asked Mrs. Nichols , while Mr. Everett answered , `` I guessedat it , '' with a peculiar emphasis on the word guessed , which led ` Lena to think he had used it purposely and not from habit . 
` Lena , who committed to memory with great ease , and who consequently did not deserve so much credit for her always perfect lessons , seldom received a word of praise , while poor Anna , notoriously lazy when books were concerned , cried almost every day , because , as she said , `` Mr. Everett did ` nt like her as he did the rest , else why did he look at her so much , watching her all the while , and keeping her after school to get her lessons over , when he knew how she hated them . '' 
`` Mother , where 's ` Lena 's dress ? 
Has n't she got any ? '' 
`` Say , mother , did n't you buy ` Lena any ? '' 
` Lena is indebted to me now for more than she can ever pay . 
As long as I give her a home and am at so much expense in educating her , she of course ca n't expect me to dress her as I do you . 
And the lady glanced toward the spot where ` Lena sat , admiring the new things , in which she had no share , and longing to ask the question which Anna had asked for her , and which had now been answered . 
John Jr. , who was present , and who knew that Mr. Everett had been engaged to teach in the family long before it was known that ` Lena was coming , now said to his cousin , who arose to leave , `` Yes , ` Lena , mother 's a model of generosity , and you 'll never be able to repay her for her kindness in allowing you to wear the girls ' old duds , which would otherwise be given to the blacks , and in permitting you to recite to Mr. Everett , who , of course , was hired on your account . '' 
The slamming together of the door as ` Lena left the room brought the young gentleman 's remarks to a close , and wishing to escape the lecture which he saw was preparing for him , he , too , made his exit . 
Anna , too , was to fare like her sister , while no thought was bestowed upon poor ` Lena 's wardrobe , until her husband , who accompanied her to Frankfort , suggested that a certain pattern , which he fancied would be becoming to ` Lena , should be purchased . 
Then remembering the old delaines , and knowing by the tone of her husband 's voice that he was in earnest , she quickly rejoined , `` Why , ` Lena 's got two new dresses at home . '' 
When ` Lena left the room after learning that she had no part in the mass of Christmas finery , she repaired to the arbor bridge , where she had wept so bitterly on the first day of her arrival , and which was now her favorite resort . 
For a time she sat watching the leaping waters , swollen by the winter rains , and wondering if it were not possible that they started at first from the pebbly spring which gushed so cool and clear from the mountain side near her old New England home . 
This reminded her of where and what she was now -- a dependent on the bounty of those who wished her away , and who almost every day of her life made her feel it so keenly , too . 
Not one among them loved her except Anna , and would not her affection change as they grew older ? 
Then her thoughts took another direction . 
Durward Bellmont was coming -- but did she wish to see him ? 
Could she bear the sneering remarks which she knew Carrie would make concerning herself ? 
And how would he be affected by them ? 
Would he ask her of her father ? 
Once , too , when her uncle seemed kinder than usual , she had ventured to ask him of her father , and with a frown he had replied , that `` the least she knew of him the better ! '' 
Still ` Lena felt sure that he was a good man , and that some time or other she would find him . 
All day long the clouds had been threatening rain , which began to fall soon after ` Lena entered the arbor , but so absorbed was she in her own thoughts , that she did not observe it until her clothes were perfectly dampened ; then starting up , she repaired to the house . 
For several days she had not been well , and this exposure brought on a severe cold , which confined her to her room for nearly two weeks . 
Meantime the dress-making process went on , Anna keeping ` Lena constantly apprised of its progress , and occasionally wearing in some article for her inspection . 
This reminded ` Lena of her own wardrobe , and knowing that it would not be attended to while she was sick , she made such haste to be well , that on Thursday at tea-time she took her accustomed seat at the table . 
After supper she lingered awhile in the parlor , hoping something would be said , but she waited in vain , and was about leaving , when a few words spoken by Carrie in an adjoining room caught her ear and arrested her attention . 
They were -- `` And so ` Lena came down to-night . 
I dare say she thinks you 'll set Miss Simpson at work upon my old delaine . '' 
`` I sha n't do any such thing , '' said Carrie , glad of an excuse to keep ` Lena out of the way . 
`` Lena 's first impulse was to defy her cousin to her face -- to tell her she had seen Durward Bellmont , and that he did n't laugh at her either . 
But her next thought was calmer and more rational . 
`` When is Miss Simpson going to fix ` Lena s dress ? '' 
She , too , was an orphan , and her sympathies were all enlisted in behalf of the neglected ` Lena . 
She had heard from Anna of the brown delaine , and in her own mind she had determined that it should be fitted with the utmost taste of which she was capable . 
Her speculations , however , were brought to a close by Mrs. Livingstone 's saying , in reply to Anna , that ` Lena seemed so wholly uninterested , and cared so little about seeing the company , she had decided not to have the dress fixed until after Christmas week . '' 
The fiery expression of two large , glittering eyes , which at that moment peered in at the door , convinced Miss Simpson that her employer had hardly told the truth , and she secretly determined that ` Lena should have the dress whether she would or not . 
Accordingly , the next time she and Anna were alone , she asked for the delaine , entrusting her secret to Anna , who , thinking no harm , promised to keep it from her mother . 
But to get ` Lena fitted was a more difficult matter . 
Her spirit was roused , and for a time she resisted their combined efforts . 
At last , however , she yielded , and by working late at night in her own room , Miss Simpson managed to finish the dress , in which ` Lena really looked better than did either of her cousins in their garments of far richer materials . 
Still she was resolved not to go down , and Anna , fearing what her mother might say , dared not urge her very strongly , hoping , though , that `` something would turn up . '' 
The invitation was accepted -- the day had arrived , the guests were momentarily expected , and Carrie , before the long mirror , was admiring herself , alternately frowning upon John Jr. , who was mimicking her `` airs , '' and scolding Anna for fretting because ` Lena could not be induced to join them . 
Finding that her niece was resolved not to appear , Mrs. Livingstone , for look 's sake , had changed her tactics , saying , `` ` Lena could come down if she chose -- she was sure there was nothing to prevent . '' 
`` Wall , wall , '' said Mrs. Nichols , who had learned to dread her daughter 's displeasure , `` I 'd as lief stay up here as not , but I do want ` Lena to jine 'em . 
Without a word of answer Mrs. Livingstone walked away , leaving ` Lena more determined than ever not to go down . 
When the evening at last arrived , Anna insisted so strongly upon her wearing the delaine , for fear of what might happen , that ` Lena consented , curling her hair with great care , and feeling a momentary thrill of pride as she saw how well she looked . 
`` When we get nicely to enjoying ourselves , '' said Anna , `` you come down and look through the glass door , for I do want you to see Durward , he 's so handsome -- but there 's the carriage -- I must go ; '' and away ran Anna down the stairs , while ` Lena flew to one of the front windows to see the company as they rode up . 
First came Captain Atherton 's carriage , and in it the captain and his maiden sister , together with a pale , sickly-looking girl , whom ` Lena knew to be Mabel Ross . 
` Lena readily guessed that this was Nellie Douglass , and at a glance she recognized the Durward of the cars -- grown handsomer and taller since then , she thought . 
A pang , not of jealousy , but of an undefined something , shot through ` Lena 's heart , and dropping the heavy curtain , she turned away , while the tears gathered thickly in her large , brown eyes . 
`` Where 's ` Lena , '' asked Captain Atherton , of Anna , warming his red fingers before the blazing grate , and looking round upon the group of girls gathered near . 
Glancing at her mother , Anna replied , `` She says she do n't want to come down . '' 
`` Bashful , '' returned the captain , while Nellie Douglass asked , `` who ` Lena was , '' at the same time returning the pinchwhich John Jr. had slily given her as a mode of showing his preference , for Nellie washis favorite . 
Fearful of Anna 's reply , Mrs. Livingstone answered , carelessly , `` She 's the child of one of Mr. Livingstone 's poor relations , and we 've taken her awhile out of charity . '' 
At any other time John Jr. would doubtless have questioned his mother 's word , but now so engrossed was he with the merry , hoydenish Nellie , that he scarcely heard her remark , or noticed the absence of ` Lena . 
As the rest seemed to be similarly inclined , Carrie arose , and erelong the joyous shouts reached ` Lena , making her half wish that she , too , was there . 
`` Blind man 's buff , '' was next proposed , and ` Lena 's heart leaped up , for that was her favorite game . 
On account of the heat of the rooms , Anna , on passing the glass door , threw it open , and the next time Durward came round he marched directly into the hall , seizing ` Lena , who was trying to hide . 
Feeling her long curls , he exclaimed , `` Anna , you are caught . '' 
`` No , I ai n't Anna ; let me go , '' said ` Lena , struggling to escape . 
This brought all the girls to the spot , while Durward , snatching the muffler from his eyes , looked down with astonishment upon the trembling ` Lena , who would have escaped had she not been so securely hemmed in . 
`` Ai n't you ashamed , Lena , to be peeking ? '' 
asked Carrie , while Durward repeated -- `` ' Lena ! 
` Lena!I 've seen her before in the cars between Springfield and Albany ; but how came she here ? '' 
`` She lives here -- she 's our cousin , '' said Anna , notwithstanding the twitch given to her sleeve by Carrie , who did not care to have the relationship exposed . 
`` No , I do n't call her granny , neither -- I 've quit it , '' said ` Lena , angrily , adding , as a sly hit at Kentucky talk , `` she 's up stars , sick with the rheumatism . '' 
`` I did n't want to come , '' was her reply ; and Durward , leading her into the parlor , continued , `` but now that you are here , you must stay . '' 
`` Pretty , is n't she , '' said Nellie , as the full blaze of the chandelier fell upon ` Lena . 
`` Rath-er , '' was Carrie 's hesitating reply . 
She felt annoyed that ` Lena should be in the parlor , and provoked that Durward should notice her in any way , and at the first opportunity she told him `` how much she both troubled and mortified them , by her vulgarity and obstinacy , '' adding that `` she had a most violent temper . '' 
From Nellie she had learned that Durward particularly disliked passionate girls , and for this reason she strove to give him the impression that ` Lena was such an one . 
Once or twice she fancied him half inclined to disbelieve her , as he saw how readily ` Lena joined in their amusements , and how good-humoredly she bore John Jr. 's teasing , and then she hoped something would occur to prove her words true . 
About ten o'clock the negro who had been to the post-office returned , bringing letters for the family , among which was one for ` Lena , so curious in its shape and superscription , that even the negro grinned as he handed it out . 
` Lena was not then present , and Carrie , taking the letter , exclaimed , `` Now if this is n't the last specimen from Yankeedom . 
Just listen , -- '' and she spelled out the direction -- `` To Mis Hell-eny Rivers , state of kentucky , county of woodford , Dorsey post offis , care of Mis nichals . '' 
Unobserved by any one , ` Lena had entered the parlor in time to hear every word , and when Carrie , chancing , to espy her , held out the letter , saying , `` Here , Helleny , I guessthis came from down east , '' she darted forward , and striking the letter from Carrie 's hand , stamped upon it with her foot , declaring `` she 'd never open it in the world , '' and saying `` they might do what they pleased with it for all of her . '' 
eagerly asked Carrie , delighted to see ` Lena doing such justice to her reputation . 
almost screamed ` Lena , and before any one could interpose a word , Carrie had broken the seal and commenced reading , announcing , first , that it came from `` Joel Slocum ! '' 
And when she capers round , she makes me think of the way you danced ` High putty Martin ' the time you stuck a sliver in your heel -- '' Up to this point ` Lena had stood immovable , amid the loud shouts of her companions , but the fire of a hundred volcanoes burned within and flashed from her eyes . 
And now springing forward , she caught the letter from Carrie 's hand , and inflicting a long scratch upon her forehead , fled from the room . 
Carrie felt that she would die , almost , before she 'd apologize to such as ` Lena , and still she thought it might be well enough to give Durward the impression that she was doing her best to make amends for her fault . 
Accordingly , the next time her cousin appeared in the parlor she was all smiles and affability , talking a great deal to ` Lena , who returned very short but civil answers , while her face wore a look which Durward construed into defiance and hatred of everybody and everything . 
`` Too passionate , '' thought he , turning from her to Carrie , whose voice , modulated to its softest tones , rang out clear and musical , as she sported and laughed with her moody cousin , appearing the very essence of sweetness and amiability ! 
Pity he could not have known how bitterly ` Lena had wept over her hasty action -- not because hewitnessed it , but because she knew it was wrong ! 
Pity he could not have read the tear-blotted note , which she laid on Carrie 's work-box , and in which was written , `` I am sorry , Carrie , that I hurt you so . 
Pity , too , that he did not see the look of contempt with which Carrie perused this note ; and when the two girls accidentally met in the upper hall , and ` Lena laid her hand gently on Carrie 's arm , it is a thousand pities he was not present to see how fiercely she was repulsed , Carrie exclaiming , `` Get out of my sight ! 
Had he known all this he would have thought differently of ` Lena , who , feeling that she was not wanted in the parlor , kept herself entirely aloof , never again appearing during the remainder of his stay . 
Once Durward asked for her , and half laughingly Carrie replied , that `` she had not yet recovered from her pouting fit . '' 
The stormy weather had so increased Mrs. Nichols ' rheumatic complaint , that now , perfectly crippled , she lay as helpless as a child , carefully nursed by ` Lena and old Aunt Polly , who , spite of her own infirmities , had hobbled in to wait upon her friend . 
Nellie Douglass , who really liked ` Lena , and wished to bid her good-by , whispered to John Jr. , asking him to show her the way to his cousin 's room . 
Behind her sat ` Lena , supporting her head , and when Nellie entered , she was carefully pushing back the few gray locks which had fallen over the invalid 's forehead , her own bright curls mingling with them , and resting , some on her neck , and some on her grandmother 's shoulder . 
Mrs. Nichols was not too ill to talk , and forthwith she commenced a history of her malady , beginning at the time she first had it when ` Lena 's mother was a year and a day old , frequently quoting Nancy Scovandyke , and highly entertaining Nellie , who listened until warned by the sound of the carriage , as it came round to the door , that she must go . 
This was wholly unexpected to ` Lena , who , without replying , burst into tears . 
Nellie hardly knew what to do . 
She seldom cried herself -- she did not like to see others cry -- and still she did not blame ` Lena , for she felt that she could not help it . 
At last , taking her hand , she bade her farewell , asking if she should not carry a good-by to the others . 
`` Yes , to Mabel , '' said ` Lena . 
With something of her old spirit ` Lena answered , `` No ; he hates me -- Carrie says so . '' 
`` Cad 's a fool , '' muttered John Jr. , while Nellie rejoined , `` Durward never hated anybody , and even if he did , he would not say so -- I mean to tell him ; '' and with another good-by she was gone . 
On the stairs she met Durward , who was looking for her , and asked where she had been . 
`` To bid ` Lena good-by ; do n't you want to go , too ? '' 
`` Why , yes , if you are sure she wo n't scratch my eyes out , '' he returned , gayly , following his cousin . 
`` I reckon I 'd better tell ` Lena to come out into the hall -- she may not want you in there , '' said John Jr. , and hastening forward he told his cousin what was wanted . 
Oh , how ` Lena longed to go , but pride , and the remembrance of Carrie 's words , prevented her , and coldly answering , `` No , I do n't wish to see him , '' she turned away to hide the tears and pain which those words had cost her . 
Accordingly , as soon as Mrs. Nichols was able to sit up , her room underwent a thorough renovation , and though no great amount of money was expended upon it , it was fitted up with so much taste that the poor old lady , whom John Jr. , ` Lena , and Anna had adroitly kept out of the way until her room was finished , actually burst into tears when first ushered into her light , airy apartment , in which everything looked so cheerful and pleasant . 
So , while his sisters were away at school , he was at home , hunting , fishing , riding , teasing his grandmother , tormenting the servants , and shocking his mother by threatening to make love to his cousin ` Lena , to whom he was at once a pest and a comfort , and who now claims a share of our attention . 
When it was decided to send Carrie and Anna to New Haven , Mr. Livingstone proposed that ` Lena should also accompany them , but this plan Mrs. Livingstone opposed with all her force , declaring that hermoney should never be spent in educating the `` beggarly relatives '' of her husband , who in this , as in numerous other matters , was forced to yield the point . 
As Mr. Everett 's services were now no longer needed , he accepted the offer of a situation in the family of General Fontaine , a high-bred , southern gentleman , whose plantation was distant but half a mile from `` Maple Grove ; '' and as he there taught a regular school , having under his charge several of the daughters of the neighboring planters , it was decided that ` Lena also should continue under his instruction . 
Thus while Carrie and Anna were going through the daily routine of a fashionable boarding-school , ` Lena was storing her mind with useful knowledge , and though her accomplishments were not quite so showy as those of her cousins , they had in them the ring of the pure metal . 
Although her charms were as yet but partially developed , she was a creature of rare loveliness , and many who saw her for the first time , marveled that aught so beautiful could be real . 
She had never seen Durward Bellmont since that remarkable Christmas week , but many a time had her cheeks flushed with a feeling which she could not define , as she read Anna 's accounts of the flattering attentions which he paid to Carrie , who , when at home , still treated her with haughty contempt or cool indifference . 
She hated ` Lena -- hated her because she was beautiful and talented , and because in her presence Carrie and Anna were ever in the shade . 
Among the many who admired ` Lena , there was no one who gave her such full and unbounded homage as did her grandmother , whose life at Maple Grove had been one of shadow , seldom mingled with sunshine . 
Gradually had she learned the estimation in which she was held by her son 's wife , and she felt how bitter it was to eat the bread of dependence . 
As far as she was able , ` Lena shielded her from the sneers of her aunt , who , thinking she had done all that was required of her when she fixed their room , would for days and even weeks appear utterly oblivious of their presence , or frown darkly whenever chance threw them in her way . 
She had raised no objection to ` Lena 's continuing a pupil of Mr. Everett , who , she hoped , would not prove indifferent to her charms , fancying that in this way she would sooner be rid of one whom she feared as a rival of her daughters . 
But she was mistaken ; for much as Malcolm Everett might admire ` Lena , another image than hers was enshrined in his heart , and most carefully guarded was the little golden curl , cut in seeming sport from the head it once adorned , and now treasured as a sacred memento of the past . 
Believing that it would be so because she wished it to be so , Mrs. Livingstone had more than once whispered to her female friends her surmises that Malcolm Everett would marry ` Lena , and at the time of which we are speaking , it was pretty generally understood that a strong liking , at least , if not an engagement , existed between them . 
Thinking , too , that ` Lena had conferred a great favor upon himself by taking Mr. Everett from off his mind , he became exceedingly polite to her , making her little presents and frequently asking her to ride . 
All such communications were eagerly seized by Carrie , and fully discussed in the presence of Durward , who gradually received the impression that ` Lena was a flirt , a species of womankind which he held in great abhorrence . 
Mrs. Graham has no daughters , and she wont fancy such a chit as you ; so it must be Durward 's society that you so much desire , but I can assure you that your nosewill be broken when once he sees our ` Lena . '' 
Cadis what I call handsome , but ` Lena is beautiful , more beautiful , most beautiful -- now you have it superlatively . 
Such complexion -- such eyes -- such hair -- I 'll be hanged if I have n't been more than half in love with her myself . '' 
`` I really begin to tremble , '' said Durward , laughingly , while Carrie rejoined , `` You 've only to make the slightest advance , and your love will be returned ten-fold , for ` Lena is very susceptible , and already encourages several admirers . '' 
`` Lena has a high temper , I acknowledge , but she tries hard to govern it , and for nearly two years I 've not seen her angry once , though she 's had every provocation under heaven . '' 
`` She knows whenand whereto be amiable , '' retorted Carrie . 
`` Any one of her admirers would tell the same story with yourself . '' 
At this juncture John Jr. was called for a moment from the room , and Carrie , fearing she had said too much , immediately apologized to Durward , saying , `` it was not often that she allowed herself to speak against her cousin , and that she should not have done so now , were not John so much blinded , that her mother , knowing ` Lena 's ambitious nature , sometimes seriously feared the consequence . 
I know , '' said she , `` that John fancies Nellie , but ` Lena 's influence over him is very great . '' 
Durward made no reply , and Carrie continued : `` I 'm always sorry when I speak against ` Lena ; she is my cousin , and I would n't prejudice any one against her ; so you must forget my unking remarks , which would never have been uttered in the presence of a stranger . 
She ishandsome and agreeable , and you must like her in spite of what I said . '' 
Meanwhile ` Lena was very differently employed . 
Nearly a year had elapsed since she had seen her cousins , and her heart bounded with joy at the thought of meeting Anna , whom she dearly loved . 
Once Mrs. Nichols attempted to help , but she was repulsed so angrily that ` Lena did not presume to offer her services until the day of their arrival , when , without a word , she repaired to the chambers , which she swept and dusted , arranging the furniture , and making everything ready for the comfort of the travelers . 
Then descending to the parlors , she went through the same process there , filled the vases with fresh flowers , looped back the curtains , opened the piano , wheeled the sofa a little to the right , the large chair a little to the left , and then going to the dining-room , she set the table in the most perfect order , doing all so quietly that her aunt knew nothing of it until it was done . 
The clock was on the point of striking three , and she was bending over a roasting turkey , when ` Lena ventured to approach her , saying , `` I have seen Aunt Milly baste a turkey many a time , and I am sure I can do it as well as she . '' 
` Lena 's temper choked her , but forcing it down , she replied : `` Why , it is almost three , and I thought perhaps you would want to cool and dress yourself before they came . 
Somewhat mollified by her niece 's kind manner , Mrs. Livingstone resigned her post and repaired to her own room , while ` Lena , confining her long curls to the top of her head and donning the wide check-apron which her aunt had thrown aside , set herself at work with a right good will . 
Suiting the action to the word she got out of bed , and crawling up to the kitchen , insisted upon taking ` Lena 's place , saying , `` she could sit in her chair and tell the rest what to do . '' 
For a time ` Lena hesitated , the old woman seemed so faint and weak , but the sound of wheels decided her . 
Springing to the sideboard in the dining-room , she brought Aunt Milly a glass of wine , which revived her so much that she now felt willing to leave her . 
Durward was almost guilty of the rudeness of starting at the strangeness of ` Lena 's appearance , for as nearly as she could , she looked like a fright . 
Bending over hot stoves and boiling gravies is not very beneficial to one 's complexion , and ` Lena 's cheeks , neck , forehead , and nose were of a purplish red -- her hair was tucked back in a manner exceedingly unbecoming , while the broad check apron , which came nearly to her feet , tended in nowise to improve her appearance . 
She felt it keenly , and after returning Durward 's salutation , she broke away before Anna or John Jr. , who were both surprised at her looks , had time to ask a question . 
Durward , who sat in a corner , did not see her , but Carrie did , and a malicious feeling prompted her to draw out her companion , who she felt sure was disappointed in ` Lena 's face . 
`` I am surprised at your taste , '' said Carrie , adding , as she noticed the proximity of her cousin , `` I think she resembles ` Lena , and of course you 'll acknowledge sheis beautiful . '' 
`` She wasbeautiful five years ago , but she 's greatly changed since then , '' answered Durward , never suspecting the exquisite satisfaction his words afforded Carrie , who replied , `` You had better keep that opinion to yourself , and not express it before Captain Atherton or brother John . '' 
`` Oh , John , '' said Carrie , `` we were just disputing about ` Lena . 
Durward does not think her handsome . '' 
`` What fault has he to find with ` Lena . '' 
`` A little too rosy , that 's all , '' said Durward , laughingly , while John continued , `` She didlook confounded red and dowdyish , for her . 
John Jr. also caught a glimpse of the retreating figure , and started in pursuit , in the course of his search passing the kitchen , where he was instantly hailed by Aunt Milly , who , while bemoaning her own aches and pains , did not fail to tell him how `` Miss ` Lena , like a borned angel dropped right out of ` tarnity , had been in thar , burning her skin to a fiery red , a-tryin ' to get up a tip-top dinner . '' 
On entering the dining-room , he found all the family assembled , except ` Lena . 
She had excused herself on the plea of a severe headache , and now in her own room was chiding herself for being so much affected by a remark accidentally overheard . 
What did she care if Durward did think her plain ? 
He was nothing to her , and never would be -- and again she bathed her head , which really was aching sadly . 
`` And so ` Lena 's got the headache , '' said John Jr. `` Well , I do n't wonder , cooking all the dinner as she did . '' 
When next you see her , you 'll change your mind . '' 
Late in the afternoon , as the family were sitting upon the piazza , ` Lena joined them . 
Her headache had passed away , leaving her face a shade whiter than usual . 
The flush was gone from her forehead and nose , but mindful of Durward 's remark , the roses deepened on her cheek , which only increased her loveliness . 
At all events , I mean to venture a little nearer , '' and before Carrie could frame a reasonable excuse for keeping him at her side , he had crossed over and taken a seat by ` Lena , with whom he was soon in the midst of an animated conversation , his surprise each moment increasing at the depth of intellect she displayed , for the beauty of her mind was equal to that of her person . 
As yet , he had seen nothing to condemn in ` Lena 's conduct . 
Wholly unaffected , she talked with him as she would have talked with any stranger , and still there was in her manner a certain coldness for which he could not account . 
`` Perhaps she thinks me not worth the winning , '' thought he , and in spite of his principles , he erelong found himself exerting all his powers to please and interest her . 
Immediately remembering what he had heard , Durward , in his eagerness to watch ` Lena , failed to note the crimson flush on Anna 's usually pale cheek , as Malcolm bent over her with his low-spoken , tender words of welcome , and when the phthisicky captain , claiming the privilege of an old friend , kissed the blushing Anna , Durward in his blindness attributed the scornful expression of ` Lena 's face to a feeling of unwillingness that any save herself should share the attentions even of the captain ! 
Many a time , on similar occasions , had ` Lena claimed the attention of the captain , for the sake of leaving Anna free to converse with Malcolm , and now understanding what was wanted of her , she nodded in token that she would come to the rescue . 
Just then , Mrs. Livingstone , who had kept an eye upon her niece , drew near , and as she seemed to want a seat , ` Lena instantly arose and offered hers , going herself to the place where the captain was sitting . 
Erelong , her lively sallies and the captain 's loud laugh began to attract Mrs. Livingstone 's attention , and observing that Durward 's eyes were frequently drawn that way , she thought proper to make some remarks concerning the impropriety of her niece 's conduct . 
`` I do wish , '' said she , apparently speaking more to herself than to Durward , `` I do wish ` Lena would learn discretion , and let Captain Atherton alone , when she knows how much her behavior annoys Mr. Everett . '' 
` Lena is poor , proud , and ambitious -- there lies the secret , '' was Mrs. Livingstone 's reply , and thinking she had said enough for the present , she excused herself , while she went to give orders concerning supper . 
John Jr. , and Carrie , too , had disappeared , and thus left to himself , Durward had nothing to do but to watch Lena , who , as she saw symptoms of desertion in the anxious glances which the captain cast toward Anna , redoubled her exertions to keep him at her side , thus confirming Durward in the belief that she really was what her aunt and Carrie had represented her to be . 
`` Poor , proud , and ambitious , '' rang in his ears , and as he mistook the mischievous look which ` Lena frequently sent toward Anna and Malcolm , for a desire to see how the latter was affected by her conduct , he thought , `` Fickle as fair , '' at the same time congratulating himself that he had obtained an insight into her real character , ere her exceeding beauty and agreeable manners had made any particular impression upon him . 
Knowing she had done nothing to offend him , and feeling piqued at his indifference , ` Lena in turn treated him so coldly , that even Carrie was satisfied with the phase which affairs had assumed , and that night , in the privacy of her mother 's dressing-room , expressed her pleasure that matters were progressing so finely . 
The next morning , Durward arose much earlier than was his usual custom , and going out into the garden he came suddenly upon ` Lena . 
All the coldness of the night before was gone , but ` Lena could not so soon forget , and quite indifferently she answered , that `` she learned to rise early among the New England hills . '' 
`` An excellent practice , and one which more of our young ladies would do well to imitate , '' returned Durward , at the same time speaking of the beautifying effect which the morning air had upon her complexion . 
` Lena reddened , for she recalled his words of yesterday concerning her plainness , and somewhat sharply she replied , that `` any information regarding her personal appearance was wholly unnecessary , as she knew very well how she looked . '' 
Durward bit his lip , and resolving never to compliment heragain , walked on in silence at her side , while ` Lena , repenting of her hasty words , and desirous of making amends , exerted herself to be agreeable ; and by the time the breakfast-bell rang , Durward mentally pronounced her `` a perfect mystery , '' which he would take delight in unraveling ! 
Call her , ` Lena . '' 
But Anna was away over the fields , enjoying with Mr. Everett a walk which had been planned the night previvious , and when ` Lena returned with the intelligence that she was nowhere to be found , her aunt in great distress exclaimed , `` Mercy me ! 
` Lena 's first thought was to bring her aunt 's powder-ball , as the surest way of remedying the yellow skin , but knowing that such an act would be deeply resented , she quickly repressed the idea , offering instead to go herself to the parlor . 
`` I can at least answer her questions , '' returned ` Lena , and after a moment her aunt consented , wondering the while how ` Lena , in her plain gingham wrapper and linen collar , could be willing to meet the fashionable Mrs. Graham . 
Mrs. Graham will of course look upon her as only a little above a servant '' -- and with this complimentary reflection upon her niece , Mrs. Livingstone retired to her dressing-room , while ` Lena , with a beating heart and slightly heightened color , repaired to the parlor . 
On a sofa by the window sat Mrs. Graham , and the moment ` Lena 's eye fell upon her , her fears vanished , while she could hardly repress a smile at the idea of being afraid of her.She was a short , dumpy , florid looking woman , showily , and as ` Lena thought , overdressed for morning , as her person was covered with jewelry , which flashed and sparkled with every movement . 
Her forehead was very low , and marked by a scowl of discontent which was habitual , for with everything to make her happy , Mrs. Graham was far from being so . 
Accustomed to a great deal of attention , she had fretted herself into quite a fever at Mrs. Livingstone 's apparent lack of courtesy in not hastening to receive her , and when ` Lena 's light step was heard in the hall , she turned toward the door with a frown which seemed to ask why she had not come sooner . 
Durward , who was present , immediately introduced his mother , at the same time admiring the extreme dignity of ` Lena 's manner as she received the lady 's greeting , apologizing for her aunt 's non-appearance , saying `` she was suffering from a severe headache , and begged to be excused for an hour or so . '' 
`` But perfectly welcome , nevertheless , '' ` Lena hastened to say , thinking that for the time being the reputation of her uncle 's house was resting upon her shoulders . 
`` I dare say , '' was Mrs. Graham 's ungracious answer , and then her little gray , deep-set eyes rested upon ` Lena , wondering if she were `` a governess or what ? '' 
and thinking it strange that she should seem so perfectly self-possessed . 
Insensibly , too , ` Lena 's manner won upon her , for spite of her fretfulness , Mrs. Graham at heart was a kindly disposed woman . 
Just before ` Lena entered the parlor , Mr. Graham , had for a moment stepped out with Mr. Livingstone , but soon returning , he , too , was introduced to the young lady . 
It was strange , considering ` Lena 's uncommon beauty , that Mrs. Graham did not watch her husband 's manner , but for once in her life she felt no fears , and looking from the window , she failed to note the sudden pallor which overspread his face when Mr. Livingstone presented to him `` Miss Rivers -- my niece . '' 
And ` Lena was not an exception to the general rule , for the moment his warm hand grasped hers and his kindly beaming eye rested upon her , her heart went toward him as a friend , while she wondered why he looked at her so long and earnestly , twice repeating her name -- `` Miss Rivers -- Rivers . '' 
From the first , ` Lena had recognized him as the same gentleman whom Durward had called father in the cars years ago , and when , as if to apologize for his singular conduct , he asked if they had never met before , she referred him to that time , saying `` she thought it strange that he should remember her . '' 
You were quite a little girl then '' -- turning to ` Lena . 
`` Only ten , '' was the reply , and Mrs. Graham , ashamed of herself and anxious to make amends , softened considerable toward ` Lena , asking `` how long she had lived in Kentucky -- where she used to live -- and where her mother was . '' 
`` My mother is dead , '' answered ` Lena . 
interrupted Durward , who had heard vague rumors of ` Lena 's parentage , and who did not quite like his mother 's being so inquisitive . 
The cactus having been duly examined , praised , and commented upon , Mr. Graham casually remarked , `` Your niece is a fine-looking girl -- ` Lena , I think your son called her ? '' 
Nothing could be more marked than the difference between Carrie 's and ` Lena 's manner toward Mrs. Graham . 
A smothered laugh from John Jr. and a certain low nasal sound which he was in the habit of producing when desirous of reminding his sister of her nose , made the `` bright , naughty eyes '' flash so angrily , that even Durward noticed it , and wondered if ` Lena 's temper had not been transferred to her cousin . 
`` That young girl -- ` Lena , I think you call her -- is a relative of yours , '' said Mrs. Graham to Carrie , as they were ascending the stairs . 
`` She bears a very aristocratic name , that of Rivers -- does she belong to a Virginia family ? '' 
Carrie looked mysterious and answered , `` I never knew anything of her father , and indeed , I reckon no one does '' -- then after a moment she added , `` Almost every family has some objectionable relative , with which they could willingly dispense . '' 
`` Why not make ` Lena go into the kitchen -- ' t wo n't hurt her to-day more than it did yesterday , '' suggested Carrie . 
`` A good idea , '' returned her mother , and stepping to the parlor door she called ` Lena from a most interesting conversation with Mr. Graham , who , the moment his wife was gone , had taken a seat by her side , and now seemed oblivious to all else save her . 
`` ` Lena , I wish to speak with you , '' said Mrs. Livingstone , appearing at the door , and ` Lena , gracefully excusing herself , left the room , while Mr. Graham commenced pacing the floor in a slow , abstracted manner , ever and anon wiping away the beaded drops which stood thickly on his forehead . 
Meantime , ` Lena , having learned for what she was wanted , went without a word to the kitchen , though her proud nature rebelled , and it was with difficulty she could force down the bitter spirit which she felt rising within her . 
Had her aunt or Carrie shared her labors , or had the former askedinstead of commanded her to go , she would have done it willingly . 
But now in quite a perturbed state of mind she bent over pastry and pudding , scarcely knowing which was which , until a pleasant voice at her side made her start , and looking up she saw Anna , who had just returned from her walk , and who on learning how matters stood , declared her intention of helping too . 
`` If there 's anything I like , it 's being in a muss , '' said she , and throwing aside her leghorn flat , pinning up her sleeves , and fastening back her curls in imitation of ` Lena , she was soon up to her elbows in cooking -- her dress literally covered with flour , eggs , and cream , and her face as red as the currant jelly which Hagar brought from the china closet . 
`` There 's a pie fit for a queen or Lady Graham either , '' said she , depositing in the huge oven her first attempt in the pie line . 
But no one noticed the mistake , and when the pie was done , both ` Lena and Hagar praised its white , uncurdled appearance . 
`` Now we shall just have time to change our dresses , '' said Anna , when everything pertaining to the dinner was in readiness , but ` Lena , knowing how flushed and heated she was , and remembering Durward 's distaste of high colors , announced her determination of not appearing at the table . 
`` I shall see that grandma is nicely dressed , '' said she , `` and you must look after her a little , for I shall not come down . 
I should of gone down , '' said she , `` but I know 'd 'Til da would be madder 'n a hornet . '' 
` Lena commended her discretion in remaining where she was , and then informing her that Mr. Bellmont 's father and mother were there , she proceeded to make some alterations in her dress . 
The handsome black silk and neat lace cap , both the Christmas gift of John Jr. , were donned , and then , staff in hand , the old lady started for the dining-room , ` Lena giving her numerous charges not to talk much , and on no account to mention her favorite topic -- Nancy Scovandyke ! 
Mrs. Graham frowned majestically , but it was entirely lost on grandma , who , after a time , forgetful of ` Lena 's caution , said , `` I b ` lieve they say you 're from Virginny ! '' 
Here Mrs. Nichols , suddenly remembering ` Lena 's charge , stopped , but John Jr. , who loved to see the fun go on , started her again , by asking what relatives Miss Scovandyke had in Virginia . 
Anna was about to reply , when John Jr. prevented her , by asking , `` if it hurt his sister to be in the kitchen any more than it did ` Lena , who , '' he said , `` worked there both yesterday and to-day , burning herself until she is ashamed to appear at the table . '' 
Mortified beyond measure at what had occurred , Mrs. Livingstone hastened to explain that her servants were nearly all sick , and that in her dilemma , ` Lena had volunteered her services , adding by way of compliment , undoubtedly , that `` her niece seemed peculiarly adapted to such work -- indeed , that her forte lay among pots and kettles . '' 
An expression of scorn , unusual to Mr. Graham , passed over his face , and in a sarcastic tone he asked Mrs. Livingstone , `` if she thought it detracted from a young lady 's worth , to be skilled in whatever pertained to the domestic affairs of a family . '' 
Here ` Lena entered the parlor , very neatly dressed , and looking fresh and blooming as a rose . 
Erelong Durward , John Jr. , ` Lena , and Anna , who had joined them , left the house , and from the window Carrie saw that they were amusing themselves by playing `` Graces . '' ' 
Gradually the sound of their voices increased , and as ` Lena 's clear , musical laugh rang out above the rest , Mrs. Graham and Carrie looked out just in time to see Durward holding the struggling girl , while John Jr. claimed the reward of his having thrown the `` grace hoop '' upon her head . 
Inexpressibly shocked , the precise Mrs. Graham asked , `` What kindof a girl is your cousin ; '' to which Carrie replied , `` You have a fair sample of her , '' at the same time nodding toward ` Lena , who was unmercifully pulling John Jr 's ears as a reward for his presumption . 
Durward observed this , and when he saw them walk away together , while ` Lena appeared wholly unconcerned , he began to think that possibly Mrs. Livingstone was mistaken when she hinted of an engagement between her niece and Mr. Everett . 
` Lena , too , united in praising her teacher , until Durward felt certain that she had never entertained for him any feeling stronger than that of friendship ; and as to her flirting seriously with Captain Atherton , the idea was too preposterous to be harbored for a single moment . 
Once exonerated from these charges , it was strange how fast ` Lena rose in his estimation , and when John Jr. , with a loud yawn , asked if they did not wish he would leave them alone , more in earnest than in fun Durward replied , `` Yes , yes , do . '' 
So saying , he walked off , leaving Durward and ` Lena alone . 
` Lena was an excellent horseman , and Durward had just proposed a ride early the next morning , when his mother , forcing down her wrath , laid her hand on his shoulder , and as if the proposition had come from ` Lena instead of her son , she said , `` No , no , Miss Rivers , Durward ca n't go -- he has got to drive me over to Woodlawn , together with Carrie and Anna , whom I have asked to accompany me ; so you see ` twill be impossible for him to ride with you . '' 
`` Oh , very much , '' was ` Lena 's reply , while Mrs. Graham continued , `` I am sorry I can not extend my invitation to Miss Rivers , but our carriage will be full , and I can not endure to be crowded . '' 
Of course ` Lena declined -- he knew she would -- and determined not to be outwitted by his mother , whose aim he saw , he continued , `` I sha n't release you from your engagement to ride with me . 
Meantime John Jr. sought out ` Lena , to whom he said , `` And so you are going to ride to-morrow morning ? '' 
`` Much obliged , '' answered ` Lena . 
Mrs. Livingstone nodded , adding in an understone , that `` she presumed the ride was given up , as ` Lena had said nothing to Cæsar about the pony . '' 
With her mind thus at ease , Carrie returned to the parlor , where she commenced talking to Mrs. Graham of their projected visit to Woodlawn , dwelling upon it as if it had been a tour to Europe , and evidently exulting that ` Lena was to be left behind . 
At last ` Lena appeared , and if Durward had admired her beauty before , his admiration was now greatly increased when he saw how well she looked in her neatly fitting riding dress and tasteful straw hat . 
After bidding her good morning , he advanced to assist her in mounting , but declining his offer , she with one bound sprang into the saddle . 
Then , with some very complimentary reflections upon Lena 's riding , he returned to his pillow , thinking to himself , `` There 's a girl worth having . 
By Jove , if I 'd never seen Nellie Douglass , and ` Lena was n't my cousin , would n't I keep mother in the hysteries most of the time ! '' 
On reaching the turnpike , Durward halted , while he asked ` Lena `` where she wished to go . '' 
`` Anywhere you please , '' said she , when , for reasons of his own , he proposed that they should ride over to Woodlawn . 
` Lena was certainly excusable if she felt a secret feeling of satisfaction in thinking she was after all the first of the family to visit Woodlawn , of which she had heard so much , that it seemed like a perfect Eldorado . 
To the left of the building was a large , handsome park , in which the former owner had kept a number of deer , and now as Durward and ` Lena rode up and down the shaded avenues , these graceful creatures would occasionally spring up and bound away with the fleetness of the wind . 
Owing to some old feud , the English family had not been on visiting terms with the Livingstones ; consequently , ` Lena had never before been at Woodlawn , and her admiration increased with every step , and when at last they entered the house and stood within the elegant drawing-rooms , it knew no bounds . 
She remembered the time when she had thought her uncle 's furniture splendid beyond anything in the world , but it could not compare with the magnificence around her , and for a few moments she stood as if transfixed with astonishment . 
Durward had been highly amused at her enthusiastic remarks concerning the grounds , and now noticing her silence , he asked `` what was the matter ? '' 
`` Oh , I am half-afraid to speak , lest this beautiful room should prove an illusion and fade away , '' said she . 
he asked ; and she replied , `` Oh , yes , far more so , '' at the same time giving him a laughable description of her amazement when she first saw the inside of her uncle 's house , and ending by saying , `` But you can imagine it all , for you saw me in the cars , and can judge pretty well what were my ideas of the world . '' 
Wishing to see if ` Lena would attempt to conceal her former humble mode of living , Durward said , `` I have never heard anything concerning your eastern home and how you lived there -- will you please to tell me ? '' 
`` There 's nothing to tell which will interest you , '' answered ` Lena ; but Durward thought there was , and leading her to a sofa , he bade her commence . 
Durward had a peculiar way of making people do what he pleased , and now at his bidding ` Lena told him of her mountain-home , with its low-roof , bare walls , and oaken floors -- of herself , when , a bare-footed little girl , she picked huckleberrieswith Joel Slocum!And then , in lower and more subdued tones , she spoke of her mother 's grave in the valley , near which her beloved grandfather -- the only father she had ever known -- was now sleeping . 
` Lena never spoke of her grandfather without weeping . 
She could not help it . 
Her tears came naturally , as they did when first they told her he was dead , and now laying her head upon the arm of the sofa , she sobbed like a child . 
Durward 's sympathies were all enlisted , and without stopping to consider the propriety or impropriety of the act , he drew her gently toward him , trying to soothe her grief , calling her ' Lena , and smoothing back the curls which had fallen over her face . 
As soon as possible , ` Lena released herself from him , and drying her tears , proposed that they should go over the house , as it was nearly time for them to return home . 
Accordingly , they passed on through room after room , ` Lena 's quick eye taking in and appreciating everything which she saw , while Durward was no less lost in admiration of her , for speaking of herself so frankly as she had done . 
Many young ladies , he well knew , would shrink from acknowledging that their home was once in a brown , old-fashioned house among wild and rugged mountains , and ` Lena 's truthfulness in speaking not only of this , but many similar things connected with her early history , inspired him with a respect for her which he had never before felt for any young lady of his acquaintance . 
Had it been Carrie to whom this question was put , she would have blushed and simpered , expecting nothing short of an immediate offer , but ` Lena quickly replied , `` Not at all , '' laughingly giving as an insuperable objection , `` the size of the house and the number of windows she would have to wash ! '' 
With the first ring of the bell , John Jr. , eager not to lose an iota of what might occur , was at the table , and when his mother and Carrie , anxious at the non-appearance of Durward and ` Lena , cast wistful glances toward each other , he very indifferently asked Mrs. Graham `` if her son had returned from his ride . '' 
asked Mr. Graham ; and John Jr. replied that Durward and ` Lena had been riding nearly two hours , adding , that `` they must find each other exceedingly interesting to be gone so long . '' 
Chopping her steak into mince-meat , and almost biting a piece from her cup as she sipped her coffee , she at last found voice to ask , `` what horse ` Lena rode ! '' 
`` Fleetfoot , of course , '' said John Jr. , at the same time telling his father he thought `` he ought to give ` Lena a pony of her own , for she was accounted the best rider in the county , and Fleetfoot was getting old and clumsy . '' 
Old Cæsar was taken by surprise , and being rather slow of speech , was trying to think of something to say , when John Jr. , who had followed his mother , came to his aid , saying that `` he himself had sent Bill for Fleetfoot , '' and adding aside to his mother , that `` the next time she and Cad were plotting mischief he 'd advise them to see who was in the back parlor ! '' 
Always ready to suspect ` Lena of evil , Mrs. Livingstone immediately supposed it was she who had listened ; but , before she could frame a reply , John Jr. walked off , leaving her undecided whether to cowhide Cæsar , ` Lena , or her son , the first of whom , taking advantage of the pause , followed the example of his young master and stole away . 
The tramp of horses ' feet was now heard , and Mrs. Livingstone , mentally resolving that Fleetfoot should be sold , repaired to the door in time to see Durward carefully lift ` Lena from her pony and place her upon the ground . 
Mrs. Graham , Carrie , and Annie were all standing upon the piazza , and as ` Lena came up the walk , her eyes sparkling and her bright face glowing with exercise , Anna exclaimed , `` Is n't she beautiful ? '' 
at the same time asking her `` where she had been . '' 
`` To Woodlawn , '' answered ` Lena . 
`` The pony , '' answered ` Lena , as she passed into the house . 
Thinking it best to put Mrs. Graham on her guard , Mrs. Livingstone said to her , in a low tone , `` I would advise you to keep an eye upon your son , if he is at all susceptible , for there is no bound to ` Lena 's ambition . '' 
`` Why is n't she here ? '' 
`` Simply because she was n't invited , I suppose , '' returned his wife , detecting the disappointment in his face . 
I thought , of course , she was here -- '' `` Or you would have gone on horseback , '' suggested his wife , ever ready to catch at straws . 
Mr. Graham saw the rising jealousy in time to repress the truthful answer -- `` Yes '' -- while he compromised the matter by saying that `` the presence of three fair ladies ought to satisfy him . '' 
As they turned into the long avenue which led to Woodlawn , and Carrie thought of the ride which ` Lena had enjoyed alone with its owner -- for such was Durward reported to be -- her heart swelled with bitterness toward her cousin , in whom she saw a dreaded rival . 
But when they reached the house , and Durward assisted her to alight , keeping at her side while they walked over the grounds , her jealousy vanished , and with her sweetest smile she looked up into his face , affecting a world of childish simplicity , and making , as she believed , a very favorable impression . 
`` I wonder if you are as much pleased with Woodlawn as your cousin , '' said Durward , noticing that her mind seemed to be more intent on foreign subjects than the scenery around her . 
`` ` Lena was never accustomed to anything until she came to Kentucky , and now I suppose she thinks she mustgo into ecstacies over everything , though I sometimes wish she would n't betray her ignorance quite so often . '' 
`` According to her description , her home in Massachusetts was widely different from her present one , '' said Durward ; and Carrie quickly replied , `` I wonder now if she bored you with an account of her former home ! 
Meantime , at Maple Grove , Mrs. Livingstone , in the worst possible humor , was finding fault with poor ` Lena , accusing her of eaves-dropping , and asking her if she did not begin to believe the old adage , that listeners never heard any good of themselves . 
In perfect astonishment ` Lena demanded what she meant , saying she had never , to her knowledge , been guilty of listening . 
said ` Lena , her temper getting the ascendency . 
asked ` Lena , and her aunt replied , `` I 'll give you credit for feigning the best of any one I ever saw , but you ca n't deceive me . 
This was too much , and with eyes flashing fire through the glittering tears , which shone like diamonds , ` Lena sprang to her feet , exclaiming , `` Yes , I do know what she was . 
She was a far more worthy woman than you , and if in my presence you dare again breathe aught against her name , you shall rue it -- '' `` That she shall , so help me heaven , '' murmured a voice near , which neither Mrs. Livingstone nor ` Lena heard , nor were they aware of any one 's presence until Mr. Graham suddenly appeared in the doorway . 
At his wife 's request he had exchanged places with his son , and riding on before the rest , had reached home first , being just in time to overhear the last part of the conversation between Mrs. Livingstone and ` Lena . 
Instantly changing her manner , Mrs. Livingstone motioned her niece from the room , heaving a deep sigh as the door closed after her , and saying that `` none but those who had tried it knew what a thankless job it was to rear the offspring of others . '' 
Much as she disliked ` Lena , Mrs. Livingstone would not for the world have her become an inmate of Mr. Graham 's family , where she would be constantly thrown in Durward 's way ; and immediately changing her tactics , she replied , `` I thank you for your kind offer , but I know my husband would not think of such a thing ; neither should I be quite willing for her to leave us , much as she troubles me . '' 
At last nerving himself to brave the difficulty , he stopped before his wife , to whom he made known his plan of adopting ` Lena . 
`` I know , '' returned Mr. Graham , `` that ` Lena 's mother could be nothing else than respectable . '' 
In her excitement , Mrs. Graham forgot that it was herself who had first suggested Woodlawn as a residence , and that until within a day or two her husband and ` Lena were entire strangers . 
But this made no difference . 
She was bent upon being unreasonable , and for nearly an hour she fretted and cried , declaring herself the most abused of her sex , and wishing she had never seen her husband , who , in his heart , warmly seconded that wish , wisely resolving not to mention the offending ` Lena again in the presence of his wife . 
This he was the more willing to do , as it threw him into the society of ` Lena , who was fast becoming an object of absorbing interest to him . 
The more he saw of her , the more was his admiration increased , and oftentimes , when joked concerning his preference for Carrie , he smiled to think how people were deceived , determining , however , to keep his own secret until such time as he should be convinced that ` Lena was all he could desire in a wife . 
For her poverty and humble birth he cared nothing . 
If she were poor , he was rich , and he possessed too much good sense to deem himself better than she , because the blood of a nobleman flowed in his veins . 
He knew that she was highly gifted and beautiful , and could he be assured that she was equally true-hearted , he would not hesitate a moment . 
This was of advantage to ` Lena , for , secure of their prize , both Mrs. Livingstone and Carrie , for a time , at least , ceased to persecute her , seldom speaking of her in Durward 's presence , and , as a general thing , acting as though she were not in existence . 
Her husband had expected a like opposition with regard to ` Lena , but he was disappointed , for his wife , forgetting her declaration that ` Lena should never darken her doors , and thinking it would not do to slight her , consented that , on her uncle 's account , she should be invited . 
`` It 's bad enough to have ` Lena stuck in with us , for of course she ` llgo . '' 
` Lena has nothing decent to wear , and I do n't feel like expending much more for a person so ungrateful as she is . 
You ought to have heard how impudent she was that time you all went to Woodlawn . '' 
Then followed a one-sided description of that morning 's occurrence , Mrs. Livingstone working herself up to such a pitch of excitement , that before her recital was finished , she had determined at all events to keep back ` Lena 's invitation , as a method of punishing her for her `` insolence , '' as she termed it . 
`` Mrs. Graham will thank me for it , I know , '' said she , `` for she can not endure her ; and besides that , I do n't think ` Lena expects to be invited , so there 's no harm done . '' 
Carrie was not yet quite so hardened as her mother , and for a moment her better nature shrank from so mean a transaction , which might , after all , be found out , involving them in a still worse difficulty ; but as the thought flashed upon her that possibly ` Lena might again attract Durward toward her , she assented , and they were about putting the notes aside , when John Jr. came in , catching up his grandmother 's note the first thing , and exclaiming , `` Oh , rich ! 
-- capital!I hope she 'll go ! '' 
Then , before his mother could interpose a word , he darted away in quest of Mrs. Nichols , whose surprise was fully equal to that of Mrs. Livingstone and Carrie . 
` Lena complied , and taking the note from her cousin 's hand , read that Mrs. Graham would be at home Thursday evening , & c. `` But where 's the invite ? 
As well as they could , ` Lena and John Jr. explained it to her , and then , fully convinced that she was really invited , Mrs. Nichols began to wonder what she should wear , and how she should go , asking John `` if he could n't tackle up and carry her in the shay , '' as she called the single buggy . 
` Lena thought otherwise , for much as she desired to gratify her grandmother , she would not for the world expose her to the ridicule which her appearance at a fashionable party would call forth . 
Glancing reprovingly at her cousin , she said , `` I would n't think of going , grandma , for you are lame and old , and there 'll be so many people there , all strangers , too , that you wo n't enjoy it at all . 
`` Not without an invitation , '' said ` Lena , smilingly . 
`` True , true , '' returned her cousin . 
`` Suiting the action to the word , he descended to his mother 's room , asking for `` ` Lena 's card . '' 
`` ` Lena 's card ! 
`` Lena 's invitation ; `` you know well enough what I mean , '' returned John Jr. , tumbling over the notes which lay upon the table , and failing to find the one for which he was seeking . 
roared John Jr. , `` ` Lena not invited ! 
`` Nero brought them , '' said Carrie , `` and I think it is strange that grandmother should be invited and ` Lena left out . 
She do n't seem to fancy ` Lena much . '' 
He only knew that ` Lena was slighted , and for the next two hours he raved and fretted , sometimes declaring he would not go , and again wishing Mrs. Graham in a temperature but little suited to her round , fat proportions . 
But ` Lena did care . 
No one likes to be slighted , and she was not an exception to the general rule . 
Owing to her aunt 's skillful management she had never yet attended a large party , and it was but natural that she should now wish to go . 
But it could not be , and she was obliged to content herself with the hopes of a minute description from Anna ; Carrie she would not trust , for she well knew that whatever she told would be greatly exaggerated . 
`` I do think it 's too bad that ` Lena is not invited , '' said she one day , when Carrie , as usual , was discussing the party . 
`` I do n't understand , either , why she is omitted , for Mr. Graham seemed to like her , and Durward too -- '' `` A great ways off , you mean , '' interrupted Carrie . 
It is no worse to leave her out than scores of others who will not be invited . '' 
`` But to come into the house and ask all but her , '' said Anna . 
`` It does not seem right . 
Why , you ca n't begin to compare with her , and it 's a confounded shame that she is n't invited , and so I shall tell them if I have a good chance . '' 
`` ` Lena not invited ! 
I directed one to her myself , and gave it to Nero , together with the rest which were designed for your family . 
`` Would n't give a picayune for the whole affair without her -- that 's what you mean , and why not say so ? 
I speak right out about Nellie , and she is n't one half as handsome as ` Lena . '' 
`` It is n't ` Lena 's beauty that I admire altogether , '' returned Durward . 
`` I like her for her frankness , and because I think her conduct is actuated by the best of principles ; perhaps I am mistaken -- '' `` No , you are not , '' again interrupted John Jr. `` ` Lena is just what she seems to be . 
There 's no deception in her . 
Spunky as the old Nick , youknow , but still she governs her temper admirably , and between you and me , I know I 'm a better man than I should have been had she never come to live with us . 
How well I remember the first time I saw her , '' he continued , repeating to Durward the particulars of their interview in Lexington , and describing her introduction to his sisters . 
`` From the moment she refused to tell that lie for me , I liked her , '' said he , `` and when she dealt me that blow in my face , my admiration was complete . '' 
But unfortunately , both Anna and ` Lena were present , and as there was no means of being rid of them , she retained her seat at the piano , carelessly turning over the leaves of her music book , when the door opened , and Corinda , not Durward , appeared . 
`` If you please , Miss ` Lena , '' said the girl , Marster Bellmont want to speak with you in the hall . '' 
`` With ` Lena ! 
`` Are you sure it was ` Lena ? '' 
said Carrie , suspecting his errand , and thinking to keep herself from all suspicion by appearing `` wonderfully pleased '' that ` Lena was not intentionally neglected . 
Before Corinda could reply , ` Lena had stepped into the hall , and was standing face to face with Durward , who retained her hand , while he asked if `` she really believed they intended to slight her , '' at the same time explaining how it came to his knowledge , and saying `` he hoped she would not fail to attend . '' 
` Lena hesitated , but he pressed her so hard , saying he should surely think she distrusted them if she refused , that she finally consented , and he took his leave , playfully threatening to come for her himself if she were not there with the rest . 
said Carrie with a sneer , as ` Lena reëntered the parlor . 
`` Yes , a great deal , '' was ` Lena 's truthful answer . 
This was true , for ` Lena had nothing fit for the occasion , and she was beginning to wish she had not been invited , when her uncle came in , and to him Anna forthwith stated the case , saying ` Lena must have a new dress , and suggesting embroidered muslin . 
They should have invited her earlier . '' 
`` Is n't Miss Simpson still here ? '' 
Anna replied that she was , and then turning to ` Lena , Mr. Livingstone asked if `` she wanted to go very much . '' 
The tears which shone in her eyes were a sufficient answer , and when at supper that night , inquiry was made for Mr. Livingstone , it was said that he had gone to Frankfort . 
No one knew until late in the evening , when he returned home , bringing with him ` Lena 's dress , which Anna pronounced `` the sweetest thing she ever saw , '' at the same time running with it to her cousin . 
Stay , '' he continued , as he saw her about to speak , `` You are my wife , and as ` Lena is at last invited , your secret is safe , but remember , it must not be repeated . 
But he had her in his power -- she knew that -- and for a time it rendered her very docile , causing her to consult with Miss Simpson concerning the fitting of ` Lena 's dress , herself standing by when it was done , and suggesting one or two improvements , until ` Lena , perfectly bewildered , wondered what had come over her aunt , that she should be so unusually kind . 
Carrie , too , learning from her mother how matters stood , thought proper to change her manner , and while in her heart she hoped something would occur to keep ` Lena at home , she loudly expressed her pleasure that she was going , offering to lend her several little ornaments , and doing many things which puzzled ` Lena , who readily saw that she was feigning what she did not feel . 
Meanwhile , grandma , learning that ` Lena was invited , declared her intention of going . 
`` I should n't of gin up in the first o n't , '' said she , `` only I wanted to show 'em proper resentment ; but now it 's different , and I 'll go , anyway -- 'Til da may say what she 's a mind to . '' 
It was in vain that ` Lena reasoned the case . 
Grandma was decided , and it was not until both her son and daughter interfered , the one advising and the other commanding her to stay at home , that she yielded with a burst of tears , for grandma was now in her second childhood , and easily moved . 
It was terrible to ` Lena to see her grandmother weep , and twining her arms around her neck , she tried to soothe her , saying , `` she would willingly stay at home with her if she wished it . '' 
But she was of too cheerful a nature long to remember grief , and drying her tears , she soon forgot her trouble in the pride and satisfaction which she felt when she saw how well the white muslin became ` Lena , who , John Jr. said , never looked so beautifully as she did when arrayed for the party . 
Mr. Livingstone had not been sparing of his money when he purchased the party dress , which was a richly embroidered muslin , and fell in soft folds around ` Lena 's graceful figure . 
Her long , flowing curls were interwined with a few natural flowers , her only attempt at ornament of any kind , and , indeed , ornaments would have been sadly out of place on ` Lena . 
So it was decided that she should stay at Maple Grove , and then Mrs. Livingstone , passing her arm around her waist , whispered , `` Go down with me , '' at the same time starting for the parlor , followed by her daughters , Nellie , and ` Lena . 
At the door they met Durward , who , as he took ` Lena 's hand , said , `` It is well you remembered your promise , for I was about starting after you . '' 
When the guests had nearly all arrived , both Mr. Graham and Durward started for ` Lena , the latter reaching her first , and paying her so many little attentions , that the curiosity of others was aroused , and frequently was the question asked , `` Who is she , the beautiful young lady in white muslin and curls ? '' 
` Lena colored scarlet , and gazed wistfully around the room in quest of some other shelter when Durward should relinquish her , as she felt he would surely do , but none presented itself . 
said ` Lena , unconsciously and half aloud . 
`` Stay with me , '' answered Durward , drawing her hand further within his arm , and bending upon her a look of admiration which she could not mistake . 
Thus importuned , Durward released ` Lena and walked away , attaching himself to Carrie , who clung to him closer , if possible , than did the old captain to Anna . 
As she was ascending the stairs , John Jr. observed that Mabel was with her , and turning to ` Lena , who now leaned on his arm , he said , `` There goes the future Mrs. John Jr. -- so mother thinks ! '' 
asked ` Lena , looking around . 
`` I saw them together , '' answered ` Lena , `` and I thought it very kind in my aunt , for no one else seemed to notice her , and I felt sorry for her . 
`` Why , '' returned , ` Lena , `` your mother thinks the country air will do her good . '' 
When ` Lena came down to bid her host and hostess good night , the former retained her hand , while he expressed his sorrow at her leaving so soon . 
And now , with a growing hatred toward ` Lena , she determined to increase her vigilance , feeling sure she should discover somethingif she only continued faithful to the end . 
John Jr. , ` Lena , and Anna declared themselves to have been highly pleased with everything , while Carrie , in the worst of humors , pronounced it `` a perfect bore , '' saying she never had so disagreeable a time in all her life , and ending her ill-natured remarks by a malicious thrust at ` Lena , for having so long kept Mr. Bellmont at her side . 
`` I suppose you fancy he would have looked better with you , but I think he showed his good taste by preferring ` Lena , '' said John Jr. ; then turning toward the large easy chair , where Mabel sat , pale , weary , and spiritless , he asked `` how she had enjoyed herself . '' 
But she was very unfortunate in her answer , which was , `` that on account of her ill health , she seldom enjoyed anything of the kind . '' 
If there was anything in which Mabel excelled , it was horsemanship , she being a better rider , if possible , than ` Lena , and now , at Mrs. Livingstone 's proposition , she looked up eagerly at John Jr. , who replied . '' 
mother , I ca n't always be bothered with a girl ; '' then as he saw how Mabel 's countenance fell , he continued , `` Let ` Lena ride with her -- she wants to , I know . '' 
`` Certainly , '' said ` Lena , whose heart warmed toward the orphan girl , partly because she was an orphan , and partly because she saw that she was neglected and unloved . 
So when ` Lena was proposed as a substitute , she seemed equally well pleased , and the young man , as he walked off to order the ponies , mentally termed himself a bear for his rudeness ; `` for after all , '' thought he , `` it 's mother who has designs upon me , not Mabel . 
This opinion once satisfactorily settled , it was strange how soon John Jr. began to be sociable with Mabel , finding her much more agreeable than he had at first supposed , and even acknowledging to ` Lena that `` she was a good deal of a girl , after all , were it not for her everlasting headaches and the smell of medicine , '' which he declared she always carried about with her . 
`` Hush-sh , '' said ` Lena -- `` you sha n't talk so , for she is sick a great deal , and she does not feign it , either . '' 
Next to Mrs. Livingstone , ` Lena was Mabel 's best friend , and when she saw how much her cousin 's rudeness and indifference pained her , she determined to talk with him about it . 
There was no person in the world who possessed so much influence over John Jr. as did ` Lena , and now , hearing her patiently through , he replied , `` I know I 'm impolite to Mabel , but hang me if I can help it . 
`` I do n't understand you , '' said ` Lena , and her cousin continued : `` Why , when Mabel first came here , I do not think she knew what mother was fishing for , so she was not so much at fault , but she does now -- '' `` Are you sure ? '' 
interrupted ` Lena , and John Jr. replied , `` She 's a confounded fool if she do n't . 
`` I think you are mistaken with regard to Mabel , '' said ` Lena , `` for I 've no idea she 's in love with you a bit more than I am . 
said ` Lena , at the same time continuing -- `` No , I do n't suppose Mabel is dying for you at all . 
I do n't ask you to love her , '' said she , `` but I do ask you to treat her well . 
`` So they do , '' answered John , upon whom ` Lena 's words were having a good effect . 
`` I 'll warrant you , '' returned Lena , who really had no idea that Mabel cared aught in particular for her cousin , and satisfied with the result of her interview , she started to leave the room . 
`` Perfectly sure , '' was ` Lena 's answer . 
`` The plague , she do n't , '' thought John , as the door closed upon ` Lena ; and such is human nature , that the young man began to think that if Mabel did n't care for him , he 'd see if he could ` nt make her , for after all , there was something pleasant in being liked , even by Mabel ! 
The next day , as the young ladies were sitting together in the parlor , John Jr. joined them , and after wringing Carrie 's nose , pulling ` Lena 's and Anna 's curls , he suddenly upset Mabel 's work-box , at the same time slily whispering to his cousin , `` Ai n't I coming round ? '' 
John and Mabel were apparently on the most amicable terms , he deeming ` Lena 's approbation a sufficient reward for the many little attentions which he paid to Mabel , and she , knowing nothing of all that had passed , drinking in his every word and look , learning to live upon his smile , and conforming herself , as far as possible , to what she thought would best please him . 
So , with this lesson , Mabel for the first time in her life attempted to act as she did not feel , feigning carelessness or indifference when every pulse of her heart was throbbing with joy at some little attention paid her by John Jr. , who could be very agreeable when he chose , and who , observing her apparent indifference , began to think that what ` Lena had said was true , and that Mabel really cared nothing for him . 
`` There is more to her than I supposed , '' said he one day to ` Lena , who was commending him for his improved manner . 
And he told the truth , for with his prejudice laid aside , he , as is often the case , began to find virtues in her , the existence of which he had never suspected . 
Frequently , now , he talked , laughed , and rode with her , praising her horsemanship , pointing out some points wherein it might be improved , and never dreaming the while of the deep affection his conduct had awakened in the susceptible girl . 
`` Oh , I am so happy , '' said she one day to ` Lena , who was speaking of her improved health . 
I dreaded to come here at first , but now I shall never regret it , never . '' 
She was standing before the long mirror in the parlor , adjusting the feathers to her tasteful velvet cap , which , with her neatly fitting riding-dress , became her better than anything else . 
The excitement of her words sent a deep glow to her cheek , while her large black eyes sparkled with unusual brilliancy . 
She was going out with John Jr. , who , just as she finished speaking , appeared in the doorway , and catching a glimpse of her face , exclaimed in his blunt , jocose way , `` Upon my word , Meb , if you keep on , you 'll get to be quite decent looking in time . '' 
'T was the first compliment of the kind he had ever paid her , and questionable as it was , it tended to strengthen her fast forming belief that her affection for him was returned . 
Carrie , who never had any fancy for Mabel , and only endured her because she was rich , was coolly polite , merely offering her hand , and then resumed the novel she was reading , even before Mabel had left . 
Anna and ` Lena bade her a more affectionate adieu , and then advancing toward John Jr. , who , in dressing-gown and slippers , reclined upon the sofa , she offered him her hand . 
Could she have known how lightly John Jr. treated the matter , laughingly describing his leave-taking to his sisters and ` Lena , and saying , `` Meb was n't the worst girl in the world , after all , '' she might not have been so easily duped . 
But she did not know all this , and thus was the delusion perfect . 
Nellie Douglasssat alone in her chamber , which was filled with articles of elegance and luxury , for her father , though far from being wealthy , still loved to surround his only daughter with everything which could increase her comfort . 
So the best , the fairest , and the most costly was always for her , his `` darling Nellie , '' as he called her , when with bounding footsteps she flew to greet him on his return at night , ministering to his wants in a thousand ways , and shedding over his home such a halo of sunshine that ofttimes he forgot that he was a lonely widower , while in the features of his precious child he saw again the wife of his bosom , who years before had passed from his side forever . 
But Mabel was coming to-day , and he was to accompany her , for so had ` Lena written , and Nellie 's cheeks glowed and her heart beat high , as she thought of what might occur . 
She knew well that in point of wealth she was not his equal , for though mingling with the first in the city , her father was poor -- but one of John Jr. 's nature would never take that into consideration . 
His arm was thrown carelessly across the back of ` Lena 's chair , while he occasionally bent forward to look at a book of prints which she was examining . 
The sight of him determined her to wait a little , ere she retailed her precious bit of gossip to her son . 
He was Nellie 's cousin , and as such , would in all probability repeat to her what he heard . 
Durward and ` Lena , however , needed watching , and by a little maneuvering , she managed to separate them , greatly to the satisfaction of Carrie , who sat upon the sofa , one foot bent under her , and the other impatiently tapping the carpet . 
From the moment Durward took his seat by her cousin , she had appeared ill at ease , and as he began to understand her better , he readily guessed that her silent mood was owing chiefly to the attentions he paid to ` Lena , and not to a nervous headache , as she said , when her grandmother , inquiring the cause of her silence , remarked , that `` she 'd been chipper enough until Mr. Bellmont came in . '' 
He admired ' Lena , and John Jr. like , it made but little difference with him who knew it . 
Consequently , when she sent ` Lena from the room on some triffing errand , herself appropriating the vacated seat , he saw in it no particular design , but in his usual pleasant way commenced talking with Carrie , who brightened up so much that grandma asked `` if her headache was n't e ` en-a ` most well ! '' 
When ` Lena returned to the parlor , Durward was proposing a surprise visit to Nellie Douglass some time during the holidays . 
said he , turning toward Carrie and Anna , but meaning ` Lena quite as much as either of them . 
`` And I too , '' said ` Lena , laying her hand on John Jr. 's shoulder , as if he would of course be her escort . 
` Lena was about to reply , when Durward , a little provoked at Carrie 's manner , prevented her by saying , `` Of course I meant Miss Rivers , and I will now do myself the honor of asking her to ride with me , either on horseback or in a carriage , just as she prefers . '' 
In a very graceful manner ` Lena accepted the invitation , saying that `` she always preferred riding on horseback , but as the pony which she usually rode had recently been sold , she would be content to go in any other way . '' 
what 's that for ? '' 
asked Anna ; and her mother replied , `` We 've about forty horses on our hands now , and as Fleetfoot was seldom used by any one except ` Lena , your father thought we could n't afford to keep him . '' 
She did not dare tell the truth of the matter , and say that ever since the morning when ` Lena rode to Woodlawn with Durward , Fleetfoot 's fate had been decreed . 
Repeatedly had she urged the sale upon her husband , who , wearied with her importunity , at last consented , selling him to a neighboring planter , who had taken him away that very day . 
`` What is ` Lena going to ride , I should like to know . '' 
` Lena pressed his arm to keep him still , but he would not heed her . 
Perhaps we 'll get ` Lena a better and younger horse . 
This was said in a half timid way , which brought the tears to ` Lena 's eyes , for at the bottom of it all she saw her aunt , who sat looking into the glowing grate , apparently oblivious to all that was passing around her . '' 
Soon after , Durward took his leave , telling ` Lena he should call for her on Thursday . 
said Mrs. Livingstone , with a peculiar smile , which nettled ` Lena more than any open attack would have done . 
On this occasion , every servant at Maple Grove was remembered , for Anna and ` Lena had worked both early and late in preparing some little present , and feeling amply compensated for their trouble , when they saw how much happiness it gave . 
`` Mother , I believe , has sent Carrie something , and if ` Lena will step to the door , she will see her gift from father , who hopes it will give her as much pleasure to accept it , as it does him to present it . '' 
thought Carrie , rising languidly from the sofa , and following ` Lena and her sister to the side door , where stood one of Mr. Graham 's servants , holding a beautiful gray pony , all nicely equipped for riding . 
Never dreaming that this was intended for ` Lena , Carrie looked vacantly around , saying , `` Why , where is it ; I do n't see anything . '' 
`` Here , '' said Durward , taking the bridle from the negro 's hand , and playfully throwing it across ` Lena 's neck . 
Vesta , allow me to introduce you and your new mistress , Miss ` Lena , to each other , '' and catching her up , as if she had been a feather , he placed her in the saddle . 
Then , at a peculiar whistle , the well-trained animal started off upon an easy gallop , bearing its burden lightly around the yard , and back again to the piazza . 
he asked of ` Lena , extending his arms to lift her down . 
For a moment ` Lena could not speak , her heart was so full . 
But at last , forcing down her emotion , she replied , `` Oh , very , very much ; but it is n't for me , I know -- there must be some mistake . 
`` Thank you , thank you -- you and Mr. Graham too -- a thousand times , '' said ` Lena , winding her arms around the neck of the docile animal , who did her best to return the caress , rubbing her face against ` Lena , and evincing her gentleness in various ways . 
`` I can keep fifty horses , if I choose , and nothing will give me more pleasure than to take care of this one for ` Lena , who deserves it if any one does . '' 
asked ` Lena , the tears gushing from her shining , brown eyes . 
`` Certainly , '' said he , and with a nimble spring she caught him around the neck , imprinting upon his lips the first and only kiss she had ever given him ; then , amid blushes and tears , which came from a heart full of happiness , she ran away up stairs followed by the envious eyes of Carrie , who repaired to her mother 's room , where she stated all that had transpired -- `` How Mr. Graham had sent ` Lena a gray pony -- how she had presumed to accept it -- and how , just to show off before Mr. Bellmont , she had wound her arms around its neck , and then actually kissed pa ! '' 
Vesta belonged to ` Lena -- Mr. Livingstone had given orders to have it well-cared for -- and worse than all the rest , ` Lena was to accompany Durward to Frankfort . 
The old negress was better to-day , and attired in the warm double-gown which Mabel had purchased and ` Lena had made , she sat up in a large , comfortable rocking-chair , which John Jr. had given her at the commencement of her illness , saying it was `` his Christmas gift in advance . '' 
Thursdaymorning came , bright , sunshiny and beautiful , and at about ten o'clock ` Lena , dressed and ready for her ride , came down to the parlor , where she found John Jr. . 
`` Why , ready for our visit , '' replied ` Lena , at the same time advancing nearer , to see what ailed him . 
`` All the visit I make to-day wo n't hurt me , I reckon , '' said he , pushing his hat a little more to one side and looking up at ` Lena , who , in some surprise , asked what he meant . 
repeated ` Lena . 
asked Durward , who , in the emergency , felt constrained to offer his services to Carrie , though he would greatly have preferred ` Lena 's company alone . 
This would of course bring him close to her side , and after a little well-feigned hesitation , she replied , `` I am sorry to trouble you , but if you would be so kind -- '' ` Lena saw through the ruse , and patting Vesta gently , rode on in advance , greatly to the satisfaction of Carrie , and greatly to the chagrin of Durward , who replied to his loquacious companion only in monosyllables . 
Once , indeed , when she said something concerning ` Lena 's evident desire to show off her horsemanship , he answered rather coolly , that `` he 'd yet to discover in Miss Rivers the least propensity for display of any kind . '' 
`` You 've never lived with her , '' returned Carrie , and there the conversation concerning ` Lena ceased . 
`` He could not part with both his daughters , '' he said , and Mabel decided to remain , stipulating that ` Lena , of whom she was very fond , should pass a portion of the time with her . 
`` All the time , if she chooses , '' said Mr. Douglass , who also liked ` Lena , while Nellie , who was present , immediately proposed that she should take music lessons of Monsieur Du Pont , who had recently come to the city , and who was said to be a superior teacher . 
`` She is fond of music , '' said she , `` and has always wanted to learn , but that aunt of hers never seemed willing ; and this will be a good opportunity , for she can use my piano all the time if she chooses . '' 
exclaimed Mabel , generously thinking how she would pay the bills , and how much she would assist ` Lena , for Mabel was an excellent musician , singing and playing admirably . 
When this plan was proposed to ` Lena , she objected , for two reasons . 
The first , that she could not leave her grandmother , and second , that much as she desired the lessons , she would not suffer Mabel to pay for them , and she had no means of her own . 
So , go , '' the old lady continued , whispering in ` Lena 's ear , `` Go , and mebby some day you 'll be a music teacher , and take care of us both . '' 
Still , ` Lena hesitated at receiving so much from Mabel , who , after a moment 's thought , exclaimed , `` Why , I can teach you myself ! 
You 'll go now , I know '' -- and Mabel plead her cause so well , that ` Lena finally consented , saying she should come home once a week to see her grandmother . 
For ` Lena 's sake I am glad to have her go , though heaven knows what I shall do without her . '' 
So when her husband objected , saying ` Lena could take lessons at home if she liked , she quietly overruled him , giving many good reasons why Lena should go , and finally saying , that if Mrs. Nichols was very lonely without her , she might spend her evenings in the parlor when there was no company present ! 
So it was decided that ` Lena should go , and highly pleased with the result of their call , Mr. Douglass and Mabel returned to Frankfort . 
`` Nellie 's gone , and with her all for which I lived , for she 's the only girl except ` Lena who is n't a libel on the sex -- or , yes -- there 's Anna -- does as well as she knows how -- and there 's Mabel , a little simpleton , to be sure , but amiable and good-natured , and on the whole , as smart as they 'll average . 
'T was kind in her , anyway , to offer to pay ` Lena 's music bills . '' 
` Lena , too , was gone , but the result of this was not what she had hoped . 
Durward had been at Maple Grove but once since ` Lena left , while she had heard of his being in Frankfort several times . 
`` Something must be done '' -- her favorite expression -- and in her difficulty she determined to call upon Mrs. Graham , whom she had not seen since Christmas . 
Nervous and uncomfortable was the lady of Woodlawn this morning , for she had just passed through a little conjugal scene with her husband , whom she had called a brute , lamenting the dispensation of Providence which took from her `` her beloved Sir Arthur , who always thought whatever she said was right , '' and ending by throwing herself in the most theatrical manner upon the sofa in the parlor , where , with both her blood and temper at a boiling heat , she lay , when her waiting-maid , but recently purchased , announced the approach of a carriage . 
The Richards ' blood she knew was good , but the Nichols ' was rather doubtful . 
Still , she would for once make the best of it , so she hastened to say that few American ladies were so fortunate as Mrs. Graham had been in marrying a nobleman . 
`` ` Lena is in Frankfort now , at Mr. Douglass ' , '' answered Mrs. Livingstone , `` and your son is in the constant habit of visiting there ; besides that , he invited her to ride with him when they all went to Frankfort -- ` Lena upon the gray pony which your husband gave her as a Christmas present . '' 
`` I have always been suspicious of ` Lena , knowing what her mother was , but I must confess I did not think her quite so presumptuous as to accept so costly a present from a gentleman , and a married one , too . 
But she has a peculiar way of making them think what she does is right , and neither my husband nor John Jr. can see any impropriety in her keeping Vesta . 
This compliment to her daughter pleased Mrs. Livingstone , who straightway proceeded to build Carrie up still higher , by pulling ` Lena down . 
Accordingly , every little thing which she could remember , and many which she could not , were told in an aggravated manner , until quite a case was made out , and ` Lena would never have recognized herself in the artful , designing creature which her aunt kindly pictured her to be . 
He supposed , as a matter of course , that she would , earlier or later , hear of his present to ` Lena , and he well knew that such an event would surely be followed by a storm , but after what had taken place between them that morning , he did not expect so much feeling , for he had thought her wrath nearly expended . 
But Mrs. Graham was capable of great things -- as she proved on this occasion , taunting her husband with his preference for ` Lena , accusing him of loving her better than he did herself , and asking him plainly , if it were not so . 
`` Say , '' she continued , stamping her foot , -LRB- the one without a slipper , -RRB- `` say -- I willbe answered . 
Do n't you like ` Lena better than you do me ? '' 
Mr. Graham was provoked beyond endurance , and to the twice repeated question , he at length replied , `` God knows I 've far more reason to love her than I have you . '' 
At the same moment he left the room , in time to avoid a sight of the collapsed state into which his horrified wife , who did not expect such an answer , had fallen . 
`` Can I tell her ? 
`` As though my father cared aught for ` Lena , except to admire her for her beauty and agreeable manners . '' 
He 's just told me , ` God knew he loved her better than he did me . ' 
Others know it and talk about it . 
He had always supposed he liked ` Lena , and he was glad of it , too , but to love her more than his own wife , was a different thing , and for the first time in his life Durward distrusted his father . 
Still , ` Lena was not to blame ; there was comfort in that ; and that very afternoon found him again at her side , admiring her more and more , and learning each time he saw her to love her better . 
And she -- she dared not confess to herself how dear he was to her -- she dared not hope her affection was returned . 
She could not think of the disappointment the future might bring , so she lived on the present , waiting anxiously for his coming , and striving hard to do the the things which she thought would please him best . 
True to her promise , Mabel had commenced giving her instructions upon the piano , and they were in the midst of their first lesson , when who should walk in , but Monsieur Du Pont , bowing , and saying `` he had been hired by von nice gentleman , to give Madamoiselle Rivers lessons in musique . '' 
` Lena immediately thought of her uncle , who had once proposed her sharing in the instructions of her cousin , but who , as usual , was overruled by his wife . 
And ` Lena , thinking it was of course Mr. Livingstone , who , on his wife 's account , wished it a secret , readily consented to receive Du Pont as a teacher in place of Mabel , who still expressed her willingness to assist her whenever it was necessary . 
Naturally fond of music , ` Lena 's improvement was rapid , and when she found how gratified Durward appeared , she redoubled her exertions , practicing always five , and sometimes six hours a day . 
Whenit was known at Maple Grove that ` Lena was taking lessons of Du Pont , it was naturally supposed that Mabel , as she had first proposed , paid the bills . 
The next day , finding the time hang heavily upon his hands , he suddenly wondered why he had never thought to call upon ` Lena . 
` Lena , as usual , sat at the piano , wholly absorbed , while over her bent Mabel , who was assisting her in the lesson , speaking encouragingly , and patiently helping her through all the difficult places . 
Mabel 's health was improved since first we saw her , and though she was still plain -- ugly , many would say -- there was something pleasing in her face , and in the expression of her black eyes , which looked down so kindly upon ` Lena . 
At last the lesson was finished , and rising up , ` Lena said , `` I know I should never learn if it were not for you , '' at the same time winding her arm about Mabel 's neck and kissing her glowing cheek . 
With a gay laugh they shook him off , and ` Lena , leading him to the sofa , sat down beside him , asking numerous questions about home and her grandmother . 
So he sat gazing dreamily upon her piano , the chair she used to occupy , and the books she used to read , until ` Lena , either divining his thoughts , or fancying he would wish to know , said , `` We 've not heard from Nellie since she left us . '' 
I wish they 'd taken a steamer instead of a sailing vessel , '' said ` Lena . 
Involuntarily Durward glanced toward ` Lena , but her face was as calm and unruffled as if the visitor had been her uncle . 
`` All right there , '' thought he , and withdrawing his eyes from her , he fixed them upon his father , who he fancied seemed somewhat disconcerted when he saw him there . 
It was ` Lena 's lesson-day , and erelong Du Pont came in , appearing both pleased and surprised when he saw Mr. Graham . 
`` I hope you do n't expect me to expose my ignorance before all these people , '' said ` Lena , as Du Pont motioned her to the stool . 
So , during the entire lesson , Mr. Graham stood there , his eyes fixed upon ` Lena with a look which puzzled Durward , who from behind his book was watching him . 
But Mr. Graham , if he heard it , did not heed it , his eyes and ears being alone for ` Lena . 
Seating himself near her , he commenced talking to her in an undertone , apparently oblivious to everything else around him , and it was not until Durward twice asked how he liked Mabel 's playing , that he heard a note . 
`` In your second youth , now , I fancy , '' thought Durward , watching him as he bade ` Lena and Mabel good-by , and failing not to see how much longer he held the hand of the former than he did of the latter . 
`` That 's it -- yes -- yes '' -- answered Mr. Graham , adding , ere Durward had time to utter the angry words which he felt rising within him , `` I wish you 'd marry ` Lena . '' 
`` I 'd willingly give every dollar I 'm worth for the privilege of calling her my daughter . '' 
If his father had an undue regard for ` Lena , why should he wish to see her the wife of another , and that other his son ? 
Was it his better and nobler nature struggling to save her from evil , which prompted the wish ? 
`` ` Lena is too beautiful to be alone in the world . 
I will propose to her at once , and she will thus be out of danger . '' 
No , his home should be full of sunlight , of music and flowers , where no angry word or darkening frown could ever find entrance ; and thus dreaming of a blissful future , when ` Lena should be his bride , he fell asleep . 
John Jr. had returned , and purposely telling his mother and Carrie whom he had left with ` Lena , had succeeded in putting them both into an uncomfortable humor , the latter secretly lamenting the mistake which she had committed in suffering ` Lena to stay with Mabel . 
But it could not be remedied now . 
There was no good reason for calling her home , and the lady broke at least three cambric-needles in her vigorous jerks at the handkerchief she was hemming . 
A heavy tread upon the piazza , a loud ring of the bell , and Carrie straightened up , thinking it might possibly be Durward , who had called on his way home , but the voice was strange , and rather impatiently she waited . 
Instantly John Jr. remembered ` Lena 's love-letter , and anticipating fun , exclaimed , `` Show him in Ben -- show him in . '' 
Did n't he learn his trade in Boston , the very center and source of all the ismsof the day , and ought not Mr. Livingstone to feel proud of such a guest , and would n't ` Lena stare when she saw him so much improved from what he was when they picked checkerberriestogether ? 
When at last he 'd finished laughing , he thought again of ` Lena , and turning to Mrs. Livingstone , asked where she was , raising his voice to a high key on account of her supposed deafness . 
`` Mother do n't seem inclined to answer your question concerning ` Lena , '' said John Jr. , `` so I will do it for her . 
She is in Frankfort , taking music lessons . 
You used to know her , I believe . '' 
I chased her once with a streaked snake , and if she did ' t put ` er through , then I 'm no judge . 
I 'd give a fo ` pence to hear her play . '' 
The next morning he announced his intention of visiting Frankfort , proposing to grandma that she should accompany him , and she was about making up her mind to do so , when ` Lena and Mabel both appeared in the yard . 
With his usual assurance , Joel advanced toward ` Lena , greeting her tenderly , and whispering in her ear that `` he found she was greatly improved as well as himself , '' while ` Lena wondered in what the improvement consisted . 
She had formerly known him as a great , overgrown , good-natured boy , and now she saw him a `` conceited gawky . '' 
Still , her manner was friendly toward him , for he had come from her old home , had breathed the air of her native hills , and she well remembered how , years ago , he had with her planted and watered the flowers which he told her were still growing at her mother 's grave . 
As he was leaving the piazza , he turned back , and drawing a large , square case from his pocket , passed it to ` Lena , saying it was a daguerreotype of her mountain home , which he had taken on purpose for her , forgetting to give it to her until that minute . 
The look of joy which lighted up ` Lena 's face made Joel almost repent of not having said to her what he intended to , but thinking he would wait till next time , he started off , his heart considerably lightened by her warm thanks for his thoughtfulness . 
Is n't it natural ? '' 
exclaimed Lena , as she ran back to the parlor . 
Yes , it was natural , and the old lady 's tears gushed forth the moment she looked upon it . 
Two weeks from this time Durward again went down to Frankfort , determining , if a favorable opportunity presented itself , to offer Lena his heart and fortune . 
`` I really think , Lena , '' said he , laughingly , `` that you ought to patronize the poor fellow , who has come all this distance for the sake of seeing you . 
Durward was in earnest , but with a playful shake of her brown curls , ` Lena answered lightly , `` Oh , no , no . 
`` No never , '' said ` Lena , and Durward continued , drawing her nearer to him , `` It is time you had , then . 
I mean what I say , '' he continued , as he met the glance of her merry eyes . 
`` There is nothing I should prize more than your miniature , except , indeed , the original , which you will not refuse me , when I ask it , will you ? '' 
` Lena 's mirth was all gone -- she knew he was in earnest now . 
She felt it in the pressure of his arm , which encircled her waist ; she saw it in his eye , and heard it in the tones of his voice . 
But what should she say ? 
Closer he drew her to his side ; she felt his breath upon her cheek ; and an inaudible answer trembled on her lips , when noiselessly through the door came Mr. Graham , starting when he saw their position , and offering to withdraw if he was intruding . 
` Lena was surprised and excited , and springing up , she laid her hand upon his arm as he was about to leave the room , bidding him stay , and saying he was always welcome there . 
So he staid , and with the first frown upon his brow which ` Lena had ever seen , Durward left -- left without receiving an answer to his question , or even referring to it again , though ` Lena accompanied him to the door , half dreading , yet hoping , he would repeat it . 
But he did not , and wishing her much pleasure in his father 's company , he walked away , writing in his heart bitter things against him , not her . 
Here , having reached a cross-road , they parted , and again Durward wrote down bitter things against his father , for what could be his object in wishing it kept a secret that he was paying for ` Lena 's lessons , or why did he pay for them at all -- and did ` Lena know it ? 
He thought not , and for a time longer was she blameless in his eyes . 
A moment Durward stood transfixed to the spot , for on opening the case , the fair , beautiful face of ' Lena Riverslooked smilingly out upon him ! 
`` I do , '' he replied , in a voice husky with emotion , for Durward was terribly moved . 
Twice had ` Lena asserted that never in her life had her daguerreotype been taken , and yet he held it in his hands ; there was no mistaking it -- the same broad , open brow -- the same full , red lips -- the same smile -- and more than all , the same clustering ringlets , though arranged a little differently from what she usually wore them , the hair on the picture being combed smoothly over the forehead , while ` Lena 's was generally brushed up , after the style of the prevailing fashion . 
A look had convinced him that 't was ` Lena -- his ` Lena , he had fondly hoped to call her . 
His faith was shaken , and yet for the sake of what she had been to him , he would spare her good name . 
He could not bear to hear the world breathe aught against her , for possibly she might be innocent ; but no , there was no mistaking the falsehood , and Durward groaned in bitterness as he handed the picture to his mother , bidding her return it where she found it . 
And then , without withholding a thing , Durward told his mother all -- how he had that very morning gone to Frankfort with the intention of offering ` Lena his hand -- how he had partially done so , when they were interrupted by the entrance of a visitor , he did not say whom . 
I have loved ` Lena too well to cease from loving her so soon . 
And though I can never again think to make her my wife , I will not hear her name lightly spoken by the world , who must never know what we do . 
Mrs. Livingstone bears ` Lena no good will , you know , and sometimes when she is speaking disparagingly of her , you may be thrown off your guard , and tell what you know . 
Durward was very pale , and the drops of sweat stood thickly about his mouth as he asked this of his mother , who , mentally congratulating herself upon her son 's escape , promised what he asked , at the same time repeating to him all that she heard from Mrs. Livingstone concerning ` Lena , until Durward interrupted her with , `` Stop , stop , I 've heard enough . 
Nothing which Mrs. Livingstone could say would have weighed a straw , but the conviction of my own eyes and ears have undeceived me , and henceforth ` Lena and I are as strangers . '' 
It was accordingly decided that he should , on the morrow , start with her for Louisville , to be gone two weeks ; and with this understanding they parted , Durward going to his own chamber , there to review the past , and strive , if possible , to efface from his heart every memory of ` Lena , whom he had loved so well . 
But 't was all in vain ; he could not so soon forget her , and far into the hours of night he sat alone , striving to frame some excuse for her conduct . 
The fact that his father possessed her daguerreotype might possibly be explained , without throwing censure upon her ; but the falsehood -- never ; and with the firm conviction that she was lost to him forever , he at last retired to rest , just as the clock in the hall below proclaimed the hour of midnight . 
Meantime , Mrs. Graham was pondering in her own mind the probable result of a letter which , in the heat of passion , she had that day dispatched to ` Lena , accusing her of `` marring the domestic peace of a hitherto happy family , '' and while she cast some reflections upon her birth , commanding her never , under any circumstances , `` to venture into her presence ! '' 
This cruel letter had been sent to the office before Durward 's return , and as she well knew how much he would disapprove of it , she resolved not to tell him , secretly hoping ` Lena would keep her own counsel . 
`` Base creature , '' said she , `` to give my husband her likeness -- but he shall never see it again ; and with stealthy step she advanced toward the secret drawer , which she again opened , and taking from it both daguerreotype and ringlet , locked it , replacing the key in the pocket where she found it . 
Then seizing the long , bright curl , she hurled it into the glowing grate , shuddering as she did so , and trembling , as if she really knew a wrong had been done to the dead . 
Opening the case , she looked once more upon the hated features , which now seemed to regard her mournfully , as if reproaching her for what she had done . 
No part of the dress was visible -- nothing except the head and neck , which was uncovered , and over which fell the chestnut curls , whose companion so recently lay seething and scorching on the burning coals . 
What do you think of it ? '' 
`` Go , by all means , '' said she , glad of anything which would place distance between him and ` Lena . 
`` I 'm afraid I should be an incumbrance , and would rather not , '' said she , in a way which puzzled him , causing him to wonder `` what had come over her . '' 
`` You can do as you choose , '' said he , but I should be glad of your company . '' 
`` No , I thank you , '' was her laconic reply , as she , in turn , wondered what had come over him . 
I 'll brave the world , dare her displeasure , take ` Lena home , and be a man . '' 
Mabelhad gone out , and ` Lena sat alone in the little room adjoining the parlor which Mr. Douglass termed his library , but which Nellie had fitted up for a private sewing-room . 
It was ` Lena 's favorite resort when she wished to be alone , and as Mabel was this morning absent , she had retired thither , not to work , but to think -- to recall every word and look of Durward 's , to wonder when and how he would repeat the question , the answer to which had been prevented by Mr. Graham . 
Her uncle , her cousin , and Durward , all three approved of her accepting it , the latter coming with it himself -- so it could not be that ; and for a long time ` Lena wept passionately , resolving one moment to answer the letter as it deserved ; determining , the next , to go herself and see Mrs. Graham face to face ; and then concluding to treat it with silent contempt , trusting that Durward would erelong appear and make it all plain between them . 
`` Then I 'll see her and know what she means , '' thought ` Lena , trembling , even then , at the idea of venturing into the presence of the cold , haughty woman . 
Supper was over at the Weisiger House , and in a handsome private parlor Mrs. Graham lay , half asleep , upon the sofa , while in the dressing-room adjoining Durward sat , trying to frame a letter which should tell poor ` Lena that their intimacy was forever at an end . 
For hours , and until the last gleam of daylight had faded away , he had sat by the window , watching each youthful form which passed up and down the busy street , hoping to catch a glimpse of her who had once made his world . 
But his watch was in vain , and now he had sat down to write , throwing aside sheet after sheet , as he thought its beginning too cold , too harsh , or too affectionate . 
He was about making up his mind not to write at all , but to let matters take their course , when a knock at his mother 's door , and the announcement that a lady wished to see her , arrested his attention . 
`` You ask me why I am here , madam , '' said ` Lena . 
`` Explain yourself , madam , if you please , '' exclaimed ` Lena , her olden temper beginning to get the advantage of her . 
`` Then I will compel you to do so , for my good name is all I have , and it shall not be wrested from me without an effort on my part to preserve it , '' answered ` Lena . 
I am sure it would be very ungentlemanly in him to desert you , now , '' said Mrs. Graham , her manner conveying far more meaning than her words . 
` Lena trembled from head to foot , and her voice was hardly distinct as she replied , `` Will you explain yourself , or will you not ? 
and in return , hav n't you bestowed upon him your daguerreotype , together with a lock of your hair , on which you no doubt pride yourself , but which to me and my son seem like so many coiling serpents ? '' 
` Lena had sat down . 
She could stand no longer , and burying her face in her hands , she waited until Mrs. Graham had finished . 
` Lena paid no attention to this sarcastic remark , but continued : `` I know I accepted Vesta , but I never dreamed it was wrong , and if it was , I will make amends by immediately returning her , for much as I love her , I shall never use her again . '' 
Durward had arisen , and now in the doorway watched ` Lena , whose dark brown eyes flashed fire as she answered , `` It is false , madam . 
`` Again I repeat , that is false ; '' said ` Lena , while Mrs. Graham , strengthened by the presence of her son , answered , `` I can prove it , miss . '' 
`` I defy you to do so , '' said ` Lena , strong in her own innocence . 
`` Shall I show it to her , Durward , '' asked Mrs. Graham , and ` Lena , turning suddenly round , became for the first time conscious of his presence . 
With a cry of anguish she stretched her arms imploringly toward him , asking him , in piteous tones , to save her from his mother . 
Durward would almost have laid down his life to prove her innocent , but he felt that could not be . 
So he made her no reply , and in his eye she read that he , too , was deceived . 
With a low , wailing moan she again covered her face with her hands , while Mrs. Graham repeated her question , `` Shall I show it to her ? '' 
Oh , how joyfully ` Lena started up ; he did not believe it , after all , and if ever a look was expressive of gratitude , that was which she gave to Durward , who returned her no answering glance , save one of pity ; and again that wailing cry smote painfully on his ear . 
Taking the case from her pocket , Mrs. Graham advanced toward ` Lena , saying , `` Here , see for yourself , and then deny it if you can . '' 
But ` Lena had no power to take it . 
Her faculties seemed benumbed , and Durward , who , with folded arms and clouded brow stood leaning against the mantel , construed her hesitation into guilt , which dreaded to be convicted . 
Durward shuddered , while ` Lena involuntarily thought of the mass of wavy tresses which they had told her clustered around her mother 's face , as she lay in her narrow coffin . 
Was it because they were so strangely alike , that any allusion to her own personal appearance always reminded her of her lost parent ? 
` Lena would have sworn that the likeness was not hers , and still an undefined dread crept over her , preventing her from moving . 
`` You seem so unwilling to be convinced , allow me to assist you , '' said Mrs. Graham , at the same time unclasping the case and holding to view the picture , on which , with wondering eyes , ` Lena gazed in astonishment . 
`` It isI -- it is ; but oh , heaven , how came heby it ? '' 
she gasped , and the next moment she fell fainting at Durward 's feet . 
In an instant he was bending over her , his mother exclaiming , `` Pray , do n't touch her -- she does it for effect . '' 
He knew there was no feigning the corpse-like pallor of that face , and pushing his mother aside , he took the unconscious girl in his arms , and bearing her to the sofa , laid her gently upon it , removing her hand and smoothing back from her cold brow the thick , clustering curls which his mother had designated as `` coiling serpents . '' 
`` Do not ring and expose her to the idle gaze of servants , '' said he , to his mother , who had seized the bellrope . 
`` Bring some water from your bedroom , and we will take charge of her ourselves . '' 
There was something commanding in the tones of his voice , and Mrs. Graham , now really alarmed at the deathly appearance of ` Lena , hastened to obey . 
When he was alone , Durward bent down , imprinting upon the white lips a burning kiss -- the first he had ever given her . 
In his heart he believed her unworthy of his love , and yet she had never seemed one-half so dear to him as at that moment , when she lay there before him helpless as an infant , and all unmindful of the caresses which he lavished upon her . 
`` If it were indeed death , '' he thought , `` and it had come upon her while yet she was innocent , I could have borne it , but now I would I had never seen her ; '' and the tears which fell like rain upon her cheek , were not unworthy of the strong man who shed them . 
The cold water with which they profusely bathed her face and neck , restored her , and then Durward , who could bear the scene no longer , glided silently into the next room . 
When he was gone , Mrs. Graham , who seemed bent upon tormenting ` Lena , asked `` what she thought about it now ? '' 
`` Please do n't speak to me again , for I am very , very wretched , '' said ` Lena softly , while Mrs. Graham continued : `` Have you nothing to offer in explanation ? '' 
`` Nothing , nothing -- it is a dark mystery to me , and I wish that I was dead , '' answered ` Lena , sobbing passionately . 
`` Better wish to live and repent , '' said Mrs. Graham , beginning to read her a long sermon on her duty , to which ` Lena paid no attention , and the moment she felt that she could walk , she arose to go . 
There was no danger of his being discovered , for ` Lena was too much absorbed in her own wretchedness to heed aught about her , and in silence he walked behind her until he saw the door of Mr. Douglass ' house close upon her . 
It would be impossible to describe ` Lena 's emotions as she returned to the house . 
Twice in the hall was she obliged to grasp at the banister to keep from falling , and knowing that such excessive agitation would be remarked , she seated herself upon the stairs until she felt composed enough to enter the parlor . 
Fortunately , Mabel was alone , and so absorbed in the fortunes of `` Uncle True and Little Gerty , '' as scarcely to notice ` Lena at all . 
`` A bad headache , '' answered ` Lena , at the same time announcing her intention of retiring . 
Alone in her room , her feelings gave way , and none save those who like her have suffered , can conceive of her anguish , as prostrate upon the floor she lay , her long silken curls falling about her white face , which looked ghastly and haggard by the moonlight that fell softly about her , as if to soothe her woe . 
`` What is it , '' she cried aloud -- `` this dark mystery , which I can not explain . '' 
He could explain it -- he must explain it . 
She would go to him the next day , asking him what it meant . 
She felt sure that he could make it plain , for suspicious as matters looked , she exculpated him from any wrong intention toward her . 
Still she could not sleep , and when the gray morning light crept in , it found her too much exhausted to rise . 
Every day did ` Lena ask of Mr. Douglass if Mr. Graham had been in the city , saying that the first time he came she wished to see him . 
exclaimed ` Lena . 
He 's away from home more than half the time , just as I should be if Mrs. Graham were my wife , '' answered John , Jr. , at the same time playfully remarking that ` Lena need not look so blank , as it was not Durward who had gone so far . 
For an instant ` Lena resolved to tell him everything , and ask him what to do , but knowing how impetuous he was when at all excited , she finally decided to keep her own secret , determining , however , to write to Mr. Graham , as soon as she was able . 
asked John Jr. , and ` Lena replied , `` No , no , your mother has nothing to do with it . 
There was a faint resemblance between him and ` Lena , manifest in the soft , curling hair and dark , lustrous eyes . 
Durward had observed it before -- he thought of it now -- and glad to see any one who bore the least resemblance to her , he started up , exclaiming , `` Why , Livingstone , the very one of all the world I am glad to see . '' 
`` Well , then , to begin , are you and ` Lena engaged ? '' 
`` No , sir . '' 
`` No , sir , '' said Durward , determined , for ` Lena 's sake , that no one should wring from him the secret . 
`` I knew it all the while ` Lena was sick . 
I read it in her face when I told her Mr. Graham had gone south -- '' A faint sickness gathered around Durward 's heart , and John Jr. . 
In the meantime , ` Lena waited impatiently for an answer to the letter which she had sent to Mr. Graham , but day after day glided by , and still no tidings came . 
At last , as if everything had conspired against her , she heard that he was lying dangerously ill of a fever at Havana , whither he had gone in quest of an individual whose presence was necessary in the settlement of the estate . 
The letter which brought this intelligence to Mrs. Graham , also contained a request that she would come to him immediately , and within a few days after its receipt , she started for Cuba , together with Durward , who went without again seeing ` Lena . 
Sometimes he spoke of her as being dead , and in piteous accents he would ask of Durward to bring him back his `` beautiful ` Lena , '' who was sleeping far away among the New England mountains . 
It was mailed at Frankfort , Kentucky , and in the superscription Durward readily recognized the handwriting of ` Lena . 
`` Worse and worse , '' thought he , now fully assured of her worthlessness . 
No , 't was not best for her to know aught about it , and as the surest means of preventing its doing further trouble , he destroyed it -- burned it to ashes -- repenting the next moment of the deed , wishing he had read it , and feeling , not that he had wronged the dead , as his mother did when she burned the chestnut curl , but as if he had done a wrong to ` Lena . 
` Lena , who had returned from Frankfort , trembled lest he should come to Maple Grove , but he seemed equally desirous of avoiding a meeting , and after lingering about Woodlawn for several days , he suddenly departed for Louisville , where , for a time , we leave him , while we follow the fortunes of others connected with our story . 
She felt sure that neither her daughters , Mabel , nor ` Lena knew of Mr. Wilbur 's marriage , and she resolved they should not . 
It was summer , and as many of their city friends had left Frankfort for places of fashionable resort , they received but few calls , and by keeping them at home until the wedding was over , she trusted that all would be safe in that quarter . 
` Lena , who understood John Jr. better than any one else , saw that all was not right . 
`` Nothing , nothing , '' returned ` Lena . 
Come , what do you say ? '' 
` Lena smiled , while she disclaimed any intention toward her cousin , who , resuming the position which in his excitement he had slightly changed , continued : `` I have always dealt fairly with you , ` Lena , and now I tell you truly , I have no particular love for Mabel , although I intend making her my wife , and heartily wish she was so now . '' 
` Lena started , and clasping John 's arm , exclaimed , `` Marry Mabel and not love her ! 
So saying , the young man shook down his pants , which had become disarranged , and walked away , leaving ` Lena to wonder what course she had better pursue . 
It was Mabel 's wish that ` Lena and Anna should be her bridesmaids , Durward and Malcolm officiating as groomsmen , and as Mr. Bellmont was away , she wrote to him , requesting his attendance , but saying she had not yet mentioned the subject to ` Lena . 
Painful as was the task of being thus associated with ` Lena , Durward felt that to refuse might occasion much remark , so he wrote to Mabel that `` he would comply with her request , provided Miss Rivers were willing . '' 
`` Of course she 's willing , '' said Mabel to herself , at the same time running with the letter to ` Lena , who , to her utter astonishment , not only refused outright , but also declined giving any particular reason for her doing so . 
`` Carrie will suit him much better than I , '' said she , but unfortunately , Carrie , who chanced to be present , half hidden in the recess of a window , indignantly declined `` going Jack-at-a-pinch '' with any one , so Mabel was obliged to content herself with Anna and Mr. Everett . 
In a few words Mabel told him how everything went wrong , how neither ` Lena , Carrie , nor Anna would be p600-275 her bridesmaids , and how Anna would n't see her married because Malcolm was not invited . 
They had arrayed her for the bridal ; Mrs. Livingstone , Carrie , Lena , Anna , and the seamstress , all had had something to do with her toilet , and now they had left her for a time with him who was so soon to be her husband . 
But there was nothing , and with her heart beating at its accustomed pace , she descended the stairs in time to meet Durward , who , having reached Woodlawn that day , had not heard of ` Lena 's decision . 
Hesitatingly , Durward approached the chamber indicated , and as his knock met with no response , he ventured at last to enter unannounced into the presence of ` Lena , whom he had not met since that well-remembered night . 
Tastefully attired for the wedding in a simple white muslin , she sat upon a little stool with her face buried in the cushions of the sofa . 
She had heard his voice in the lower hall , and knowing she must soon meet him , she had for a moment abandoned herself to the tumult of bitter thoughts , which came sweeping over her in that trying hour . 
She was weeping -- he knew that by the trembling of her body -- and for an instant everything was forgotten . 
Advancing softly toward her , he was about to lay his hand upon those clustering curls which fell unheeded around her , when the thought that from among them had been cut the hated tress which his mother had cast into the flames , arrested his hand , and he was himself again . 
Forcing down his emotion , he said , calmly , `` Miss Rivers , '' and starting quickly to her feet , ` Lena demanded proudly what he would have , and why he was there . 
`` Pardon me , '' said he , as he marked her haughty bearing and glanced at her dress , which was hardly in accordance with that of a bridesmaid ; `` I supposed I was to be groomsman -- am I mistaken ? '' 
And ` Lena walked out of the room , while Durward looked after her in amazement , one moment admiring her spirit , and the next blaming Mabel for not informing him how matters stood . 
`` But there 's no help for it now , '' thought he , as he descended the stairs and made his way into the parlor , whither ` Lena had preceded him . 
And thus ended an interview of which ` Lena had thought so much , hoping and praying that it might result in a reconciliation . 
But it was over now -- the breach was wider than ever -- and with half-benumbed faculties she leaned against the open window , unconscious of the earnest desire he felt to approach her , for there was about her a strange fascination which it required all his power to resist . 
Then , when it was over -- when he was bound to her forever -- he seemed suddenly to awake from his apathy and think of what he had done . 
Crowding around him , they came with words of congratulation -- all but ` Lena , who tarried behind , for she had none to give . 
Wretched as she was herself , she pitied the frail young bride , whose half-joyous , half-timid glances toward the frigid bridegroom , showed that already was she sipping from the bitter cup whose very dregs she was destined to drain . 
Her old racking headaches returned with renewed force , confining her for whole days to her room , where she lay listening in vain for the footsteps which never came , and tended only by ` Lena , who , in proportion as the others neglected her , clung to her more and more . 
`` Please do n'ttalk so , '' said Mabel , pressing her hands upon her aching head , while ` Lena sternly exclaimed , `` Shame on you , John Livingstone . 
` Lena and Milly , however , thought differently . 
`` Let her sleep ; it will do her good , '' said ` Lena , adjusting the bed-clothes , and dropping the curtain so that the sunlight should not disturb her , she left the chamber . 
Her headache of the day before still remained , and ` Lena suggested that she should stay in her room , saying that she would herself see that every necessary attention was paid her . 
Since he had left her , John Jr. had thoughta great deal , the result of which was , that he determined on returning home much sooner than he at first intended , promising himself to treat Mabel decently , and if possible win back the respect of ` Lena , which he knew he had lost . 
It cost him a great effort to say `` my wife , '' for never before had he so called her , but he felt better the moment he had done so , and bidding his young friends adieu , he started for home with the same impetuous speed which usually characterized his riding . 
He had fully expected to meet Mabel in the parlor , and was even revolving in his own mind the prospect of kissing her , provided ` Lena were present . 
Perhaps they had company , and springing from the carriage she hastened into the house , meeting ` Lena in the hall , and eagerly asking who was in the front chamber . 
`` I believe , '' said ` Lena , `` that my cousin is not pleased with the change , and has gone back to the front room . '' 
`` The impudent thing ! '' 
` Lena heard the cry and hastened to the rescue , starting back when she saw the marble whiteness of Mabel 's face . 
`` I did ` nt kill her , ` Lena . 
Poor little Meb , '' said John Jr. , quailing beneath ` Lena 's rebuking glance , and bending anxiously over the slight form which looked so much like death . 
But Mabel was not dead . 
` Lena knew it by the faint fluttering of her heart , and an application of the usual remedies sufficed , at last , to restore her to consciousness . 
With a long-drawn sigh her eyes unclosed , and looking earnestly in ` Lena 's face , she said , `` Was it a dream , ` Lena ? 
Tell me , was it all a dream ? '' 
Again ` Lena 's rebuking glance went over to John Jr. , who , advancing nearer to Mabel , gently laid his hand upon her white brow , saying , softly , `` Poor , poor Meb . '' 
`` Why , Milly , '' said ` Lena , who overheard this soliloquy , `` do n't you know it 's wrong to indulge in such wicked thoughts ? '' 
He could light it when necessary ; or why need he sleep there , when some one else would do as well ? 
He thought of ` Lena -- she was just the one , and the next day he would speak to her . 
Accordingly , ` Lena was one day surprised by his announcing his intended trip . 
You 're a good girl , and I like you , if I did get angry with you weeks ago when I went a hunting . '' 
` Lena knew he ought not to go , and she tried hard to convince him of the fact , telling him how much pleasure she had felt in observing his improved manner toward Mabel , and that he must not spoil it now . 
John was beginning to grow impatient , for he knew he was wrong , and rather tartly he answered , as he left the room , `` Give her a decent burial , and present the bill to mother ! '' 
The next morning , as ` Lena sat alone with Mabel , John Jr. . 
The sallowness of her complexion was all gone , and on either cheek there burned a round , bright spot . 
` Lena had just been arranging her thick , glossy hair , and now , wholly exhausted , she reclined upon her pillows , while her large black eyes , unnaturally bright , sparkled with joy at the sight of her husband . 
`` It 's only to New Orleans and back , '' he said , as he saw her changing face . 
`` I sha n't be gone long , and ` Lena will take care of you a heap better than I can . '' 
Good-by , little Meb , '' grasping her hand , `` Good-by , ` Lena . 
The window of Mabel 's room commanded a view of the turnpike , and when the sound of horses ' feet was heard on the lawn , she requested ` Lena to lead her to the window , where she stood watching him until a turn in the road hid him from her sight . 
`` ' T is the last time , '' said she , `` and he will never know how much this parting cost me . '' 
That night , as they were alone in the gathering twilight , Mabel said , `` If I die before Nellie comes I want you to tell her how it all happened , and that she must forgive him , for he was not to blame . '' 
He and Nellie were made for each other , and if the inhabitants of heaven are allowed to watch over those they loved on earth , I will ask to be always near them . 
You will tell her , wo n't you ? '' 
` Lena promised , adding that she thought Mabel would see Nellie herself as she was to sail from Liverpool the 20th , and a few days proved her conjecture correct . 
So he tarried until a letter from ` Lena , which said that Mabel would die , decided him , and rather reluctantly he started homeward . 
Tenderly above her Nellie and ` Lena were bending . 
They had watched by her many a night , and now she asked them not to leave her , not to disturb a single one -- she would rather die alone . 
The sound of horses ' hoofs rang out on the still air , but she did not heed it . 
Nearer and nearer it came , over the lawn , up the graveled walk , through the yard , and Nellie 's face blanched to an unnatural whiteness as she thought who that midnight-rider was . 
` Lena felt differently . 
His silent grief conquered all resentment , and going to his side , she told him how peacefully Mabel had died -- how to the last she had loved and remembered him , praying that he might be happy when she was gone . 
Mr. and Mrs. Grahamhad returned to Woodlawn , the former remaining but a day and night , and then , without once seeing ` Lena , departing for Europe , where business , either fancied or real , called him . 
Often , when lying weary and sick in Havana , had he resolved on revealing to his wife the secret which he felt was wearing his life away , but the cowardice of his nature seemed increased by physical weakness , and from time to time was the disclosure postponed , while the chain of evidence was fearfully lengthening around poor ` Lena , to whom Mrs. Graham had transferred the entire weight of her displeasure . 
Loving her husband as well as such as she could love , she was ever ready to forgive when she saw any indications of reform on his part , and as during all their journey he had never once given her cause for offense , she began to attribute his former delinquencies wholly to ` Lena ; and when he proposed a tour to Europe she readily sanctioned it , hoping that time and absence would remove from his mind all thoughts of the beautiful girl , who she thought was her rival . 
Still , though she would not confess it , in her heart she did not believe ` Lena guilty , except so far as a desire to attract Mr. Graham 's attention would make her so . 
For this belief she had a good and potent reason . 
The daguerreotype which had caused so much trouble was still in her possession , guarded carefully from her husband , who never suspecting the truth , supposed he had lost it . 
Still she never for a moment doubted that it was ` Lena , until an event occurred which convinced her of the contrary , leaving her , meantime , more mystified than ever . 
The arrangement of the hair -- everything -- was the same , and utterly confounded , she stood gazing first at one and then at the other , wondering what it meant . 
Could ` Lena be in the city ? 
She thought not , and even if she were , the last daguerreotype was not so much like her , she fancied , as the first . 
At all events , she did not dare secrete it as she had done its companion , and stealthily returning it to its place , she crept back to bed . 
Of course ` Lena could not have been absent from home . 
Mrs. Graham felt convinced of that , and gradually the conviction came upon her that another than ` Lena was the original of the daguerreotypes . 
And yet she was not generous enough to tell Durward so . 
She knew he was deceived -- she wished him to remain so -- and to effect it , she refrained from seeking an explanation from her husband , fearing lest ` Lena should be proved innocent . 
Her husband knew there was a misunderstanding between Durward and ` Lena , and if she were to ask him about the pictures , he would , she thought , at once suspect the cause of that misunderstanding , and as a matter of course , exonerate ` Lena from all blame . 
The consequence of this she foresaw , and therefore she resolved upon keeping her own counsel , satisfied if in the end she prevented Durward from making ` Lena his wife . 
To effect this , she endeavored , during the winter , to keep the matter almost constantly before Durward 's mind , frequently referring to ` Lena 's agitation when she first learned that Mr. Graham had started for Europe . 
She had called with her son at Maple Grove on the very day of her husband 's departure . 
` Lena had not met the lady before , since that night in Frankfort , and now , with the utmost hauteur , she returned her nod , and then , too proud to leave the room , resumed her seat near the window , directly opposite the divan on which Durward was seated with Carrie . 
`` ` Lena , ` Lena , how have I been deceived ! '' 
On their way home , his mother asked if he observed ` Lena when Mr. Graham was mentioned . 
Without saying that he did , Durward replied , `` I noticed your remark to Mrs. Livingstone , and was sorry for it , for I do not wish you to say a word which will throw the least shade of suspicion upon ` Lena . 
`` I wo n't , I wo n't , '' answered Mrs. Graham , anxious to conciliate her son , but she found it a harder matter to refrain than she had first supposed . 
` Lena was to her a constant eye-sore , and nothing but the presence of Durward prevented her from occasionally giving vent in public to expressions which would have operated unfavorably against the young girl , and when at last circumstances occurred which gave her , as she thought , liberty to free her mind , she was only too willing to do so . 
Of those circumstances , in which others besides ` Lena were concerned , we will speak in another chapter . 
Malcolm Everett ` sengagement with General Fontaine had expired , and as was his original intention , he started for New York , first seeking an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Livingstone , of whom he asked their daughter Anna in marriage , at the same time amouncing the startling fact that they had been engaged for more than a year . 
`` I do not ask you for her now , '' said he , `` for I am not in a situation to support her as I would wish to , but that time will come ere long , I trust , and I can assure you that her happiness shall be the first object of my life . '' 
Anna was sitting with her grandmother and ` Lena , when word came that her mother wished to see her , the servant adding , with a titter , that `` Mas ' r Atherton thar too . '' 
Instinctively she knew why she was sent for , and turning white as marble , she begged her cousin to go with her . 
But ` Lena refused , soothing the agitated girl , and begging her to be calm . 
were now away , and she had no counselor save ` Lena , who once , on her own responsibility , wrote to Malcolm , but with a like success , and Anna 's heart grew weary with hope deferred . 
Meantime the captain , who was sitting by ` Lena , casually remarked , `` Oh , I forgot to tell you that I saw Mr. Everett in Washington . '' 
said ` Lena , quickly . 
`` Lena 's exclamation of astonishment was prevented by a shriek from Anna , who had that moment read the announcement of Mr. Everett 's marriage , which was the first in the list . 
It was Malcolm H. Everett -- there could be no mistake -- and when ` Lena reached her cousin 's side , she found that she had fainted . 
All was now in confusion , in the midst of which the Captain took his leave , having first managed to speak a few words in private with Mrs. Livingstone . 
`` Fortune favors us , '' was her reply , as she went back to her daughter , whose long , death-like swoon almost wrung from her the secret . 
For a long time Anna appeared to be in a kind of benumbed torpor , requesting to be left alone , and shuddering if Mr. Everett 's name were mentioned in her presence . 
It was in vain that ` Lena strove to comfort her , telling her there might be some mistake . 
Anna refused to listen , angrily bidding ` Lena desist , and saying frequently that she cared but little what became of herself now . 
A species of recklessness seemed to have taken possession of her , and when her mother one day carelessly remarked that possibly Captain Atherton would claim the fulfillment of her promise , she answered , in the cold , indifferent tone which now marked her manner of speaking , `` Let him . 
But Mrs. Livingstone turned angrily away , telling her to mind her own affairs . 
Then ` Lena sought her cousin , and winding her arms around her neck , besought of her to resist -- to burst the chain which bound her , and be free . 
`` Oh , if my aunt could see her now , '' thought ` Lena ; but as if her mother 's presence had a paralyzing power , Anna , when with her , was quiet , gentle , and silent , and if Mrs. Livingstone sometimes missed her merry laugh and playful ways , she thought the air of dignity which seemed to have taken their place quite an improvement , and far more in keeping with the bride elect of Captain Atherton . 
About this time Mr. Livingstone returned , appearing greatly surprised at the phase which affairs had assumed in his absence , but when ` Lena whispered to him her fears , he smilingly answered , `` I reckon you 're mistaken . 
Her mother would have found it out -- where is she ? '' 
In her chamber at the old place by the open window they found her , and though she did not as usual spring eagerly forward to meet her father , her greeting was wholly natural ; but when Mr. Livingstone , taking her upon his knee , said , gently , `` They tell me you are to be married soon , '' the wildness came back to her eye , and ` Lena wondered he could not see it . 
Do you enter into it willingly ? '' 
For a moment there was a wavering , and ` Lena held her breath to catch the answer , which came at last , while the eyes shone brighter than ever -- `` Willing ? 
`` Woman 's nature , '' said Mr. Livingstone , laughingly , while ` Lena turned away to hide her tears . 
The night was moonless , and the starlight obscured by heavy clouds , but the pale face and golden curls of Anna , for whose sake she was there alone , gleamed on her in the darkness , and ` Lena was not afraid . 
Once -- twice -- she thought she caught the sound of another horse 's hoofs , but when she stopped to listen , all was still , and again she pressed forward , while her pursuer -LRB- for ` Lena was followed -RRB- kept at a greater distance . 
Stopping only a moment , he reached the turnpike just after ` Lena struck into it . 
Thinking it was a servant , he was about to pass her , when her horse sheered at something on the road-side , and involuntarily she exclaimed , `` Courage , Dido , there 's nothing to fear . '' 
Instantly he recognized her voice , and was about to overtake and speak to her , but thinking that her mission was a secret one , or she would not be there alone , he desisted . 
Her safety might be endangered , and reining in his steed , and accommodating his pace to hers , he followed without her knowledge . 
On she went until she reached the avenue leading to `` Sunnyside , '' as Captain Atherton termed his residence , and there she stopped , going on foot to the house , while , hidden by the deep darkness , Durward waited and watched . 
Half timidly ` Lena rang the door-bell , dropping her veil over her face that she might not be recognized . 
`` I want to see your master , '' she said to the woman who answered her ring , and who in some astonishment replied , `` Bless you , miss , Mas ' r Atherton done gone to Lexington and wo n't be home till to-morry . '' 
repeated ` Lena in a disappointed tone . 
Instantly the awkwardness of her position flashed upon ` Lena , but resolving to put a bold face on the matter , she removed her veil , saying , playfully , `` You know me now , Aunt Martha . '' 
`` In course I do , '' answered the negro , holding up both hands in amazement , `` but what sent you here this dark , unairthly night ? '' 
`` Business with your master , '' and then suddenly remembering that among her own race Aunt Martha was accounted an intolerable gossip , she began to wish she had not come . 
But it could not now be helped , and turning away , she walked slowly down the avenue , wondering what the result would be . 
Again they were in motion , she and Durward , who followed until he saw her safe home , and then , glad that no one had seen her but himself , he retraced his steps , pondering on the mystery which he could not fathom . 
After ` Lena left Sunnyside , a misty rain came on , and by the time she reached her home , her long riding-dress was wet and drizzled , the feathers on her cap were drooping , and to crown all , as she was crossing the hall with stealthy step , she came suddenly upon her aunt , who , surprised at her appearance , demanded of her where she had been . 
But ` Lena refused to tell , and in quite a passion Mrs. Livingstone laid the case before her husband . 
`` Lena had been off that dark , rainy night , riding somewhere with somebody , she would n't tell who , but she -LRB- Mrs. Livingstone -RRB- most knew it was Durward , and something must be done . '' 
Accordingly , next day , when they chanced to be alone , Mr. Livingstone took the opportunity of questioning ` Lena , who dared not disobey him , and with many tears she confessed the whole , saying that `` if it were wrong she was very sorry . '' 
`` You acted foolishly , to say the least of it , '' answered her uncle , adding , drily , that he thought she troubled herself altogether too much about Anna , who seemed happy and contented . 
` Lena 's fears disturbed him , and for many days he watched his daughter narrowly , admitting to himself that there was something strange about her . 
What it would be , or by what agency it would be brought about , he did n't know , but he resolved to let ` Lena alone , and when his wife insisted upon his `` lecturing her soundly for meddling , '' he refused , venturing even to say , that `` she had n't meddled . '' 
Meantime , a new idea had entered ` Lena 's mind . 
She would write to Mr. Everett . 
There might yet be some mistake ; she had read of such things in stories , and it could do no harm . 
Gradually as she wrote , hope grew strong within her , and it became impressed upon her that there had been some deep-laid , fiendish plot . 
And how to convey it to the office was now the grand difficulty . 
` Lena would have died rather than ask a favor of him for herself , but to save Anna she could do almost anything . 
`` Lena -- excuse me -- Miss Rivers , is it you ? '' 
`` Then , '' answered ` Lena , `` take this letter and see it deposited safely , will you ? '' 
Glancing at the superscription , Durward felt his face crimson , while he instantly remembered what Mrs. Livingstone had once said concerning ` Lena 's attachment to Mr. Everett . 
`` Sometime , perhaps , I will explain , '' said ` Lena , observing the expression of his countenance , and then adding , with some bitterness , `` I assure you there is no harm in it . '' 
`` Of course not , '' answered Durward , again mounting his horse , and riding away more puzzled than ever , while ` Lena returned to the house , which everywhere gave tokens of the approaching nuptials . 
A stranger would have said ` Lena was the bride , for with flushed cheeks and nervously anxious manner , she watched each sun as it rose and set , wondering what the result would be . 
So Carrie and Durward were substituted , and as this arrangement brought the latter occasionally to the house , ` Lena had opportunities of asking him if there had yet come any answer to her letter ; and much oftener than he would otherwise have done , Durward went down to Frankfort , for he felt that it was no unimportant matter which thus deeply interested ` Lena . 
At last , the day before the bridal came , Durward had gone to the city , and in a state of great excitement ` Lena awaited his return , watching with a trembling heart as the sun went down behind the western hills . 
Slowly the hours dragged on , and many a time she stole out in the deep darkness to listen , but there was nothing to be heard save the distant cry of the night-owl , and she was about retracing her steps for the fifth time , when from behind a clump of rose-bushes started a little dusky form , which whispered softly , `` Is you Miss ` Leny ? '' 
Repressing the scream which came near escaping her lips , ` Lena answered , `` Yes ; what do you want ? '' 
Hastily tearing a blank leaf from a book which chanced to be lying in the hall , ` Lena wrote , `` We will be there , '' and giving it to the negro , bade him hasten back . 
There was no longer need to wait for Durward , who , if he got no letter , was not to call , and trembling in every nerve , ` Lena sought her chamber , there to consider what she was next to do . 
For some time past Carrie had occupied a separate room from Anna , who , she said , disturbed her with her late hours and restless turnings , so ` Lena 's part seemed comparatively easy . 
Waiting until the house was still , she entered Anna 's room , finding her , as she had expected , at her old place by the open window , her head resting upon the sill , and when she approached nearer , she saw that she was asleep . 
In the room adjoining lay the bridal dress , and ` Lena 's first impulse was to trample it under her feet , but passing it with a shudder , she hastily collected whatever she thought Anna would most need . 
`` He is here , love -- he has come to save you , '' she whispered , while Anna , only partially aroused , gazed at her so vacantly , that ` Lena 's heart stood still with fear lest the poor girl 's reason were wholly gone . 
`` Our Father in heaven help me , '' cried ` Lena , clasping her hands in anguish , while her tears fell like rain on Anna 's upturned face . 
This seemed to arouse her , for in a natural tone she asked why ` Lena wept . 
Again and again ` Lena repeated to her that Malcolm had come -- that he was not married -- that he had come for her ; and as Anna listened , the torpor slowly passed away -- the wild light in her eyes grew less bright , for it was quenched by the first tears she had shed since the shadow fell upon her ; and when ` Lena produced the note , and she saw it was indeed true , the ice about her heart was melted , and in choking , long-drawn sobs , her pent-up feelings gave way , as she saw the gulph whose verge she had been treading . 
Crouching at ` Lena 's feet , she kissed the very hem of her garments , blessing her as her preserver , and praying heaven to bless her , also . 
It was the work of a few moments to array her in her traveling dress , and then very cautiously ` Lena led her down the stairs , and out into the open air . 
`` If I could see father once , '' said Anna ; but such an act involved too much danger , and with one lingering , tearful look at her old home , she moved away , supported by ` Lena , who rather dragged than led her over the graveled walk . 
Helpless as an infant she lay , while ` Lena , motioning the negro who was in attendance to follow her , returned to the house for the trunk , which was soon safely deposited in the carriage at the gate . 
`` Words can not express what I owe you , '' said Malcolm , when he gave her his hand at parting , `` but of this be assured , so long as I live you have in me a friend and brother . '' 
Upon the broad piazza ` Lena stood until the last faint sound of the carriage wheels died away ; then , weary and worn , she sought her room , locking Anna 's door as she passed it , and placing the key in her pocket . 
Softly she crept to bed by the side of her slumbering grandmother , and with a fervent prayer for the safety of the fugitives , fell asleep . 
Theloud ringing of the breakfast-bell aroused ` Lena from her heavy slumber , and with a vague consciousness of what had transpired the night previous , she at first turned wearily upon her pillow , wishing it were not morning ; but soon remembering all , she sprang up , and after a hasty toilet , descended to the breakfast-room , where another chair was vacant , another face was missing . 
Involuntarily Mr. Livingstone glanced at ` Lena , whose face wore a scarlet hue as she hastily quitted the table . 
With a presentiment of something , he himself started for Anna 's room , followed by his wife and Carrie , while ` Lena , half-way up the stairs , listened breathlessly for the result . 
By this time ` Lena had ventured into the room , and turning toward her , Mr. Livingstone said , very gently , `` ` Lena , where is our child ? '' 
`` In Ohio , I dare say , by this time , as she took the night train at Midway for Cincinnati , '' said ` Lena , thinking she might as well tell the whole at once . 
shrieked Mrs. Livingstone , fiercely grasping ` Lena 's arm . 
`` It was Mr. Everett 's wish to return home that way , I believe , '' coolly answered ` Lena , without quailing in the least from the eyes bent so angrily upon her . 
But she was yet to learn what agency ` Lena had in the matter , and this information her husband obtained for her . 
There was no anger in the tones of his voice when he asked his niece to explain the mystery , else she might not have answered , for ` Lena could not be driven . 
Now , however , she felt that he had a right to know , and she told him all she knew ; what she had done herself and why she had done it ; that General Fontaine , to whom Malcolm had gone in his trouble , had kindly assisted him by lending both servants and carriage ; but upon the intercepted letters she could throw no light . 
From Aunt Martha he had heard of ` Lena 's strange visit , and he now remembered the many times she had tried to withdraw him from Anna , appropriating him to herself for hours . 
Sunnyside needed a mistress -- he needed a wife . 
` Lena was poor -- perhaps she liked him -- and if so , there might be a wedding , after all . 
Full of these thoughts , he reached Maple Grove , where he found Durward , to whom Mrs. Livingstone had detailed the whole circumstance , dwelling long upon ` Lena 's meddling propensities , and charging the whole affair upon her . 
`` But she knew what she was about -- she had an object in view , undoubtedly , '' she added , glad of an opportunity to give vent to her feelings against ` Lena . 
asked Durward , and Mrs. Livingstone replied , `` I told you once that ` Lena was ambitious , and I have every reason to believe she would willingly marry Captain Atherton , notwithstanding he is so much older . '' 
She forgot that there was the same disparity between the captain and Anna as between him and ` Lena , but Durward did not , and with derisive smile he listened , while she proceeded to give her reasons for thinking that a desire to supplant Anna was the sole object which ` Lena had in view , for what else could have prompted that midnight ride to Sunnyside . 
Briefly Mrs. Livingstone explained to him ` Lena 's agency in the matter , omitting , this time , to impute to her the same motive which she had done when stating the case to Durward . 
`` So ` Lena is at the bottom of it ? '' 
said he , rubbing his little fat , red hands . 
`` Well , well , where is she ? 
`` Corinda , tell ` Lena she is wanted in the parlor , '' said Mrs. Livingstone , while Durward , not wishing to witness the interview , arose to go , but Mrs. Livingstone urged him so hard to stay , that he at last resumed his seat on the sofa by the side of Carrie . 
`` Captain Atherton wishes to question you concerning the part you have taken in this elopement , '' said Mrs. Livingstone , sternly , as ` Lena appeared in the door-way . 
`` No I do n't , '' said the captain , gallantly offering ` Lena a chair . 
`` I am here , sir , to answer any proper question , '' said ` Lena , proudly , at the same time declining the proffered seat . 
The rich blood which usually dyed ` Lena 's cheek was gone , and pale as the marble mantel against which she leaned , she answered , proudly , `` I would sooner die than link my destiny with one who could so basely deceive my cousin , making her believe it was her betrothed husband whom he saw in Washington instead of his uncle ! 
come involuntarily from the lips of Durward , who had held his breath for her answer , and who now glanced triumphantly at Mrs. Livingstone , whose surmises were thus proved incorrect . 
chimed in Mrs. Livingstone . 
`` No , madam , '' said ` Lena , turning toward her aunt . 
In this I failed , and then I wrote to Mr. Everett , with the result which you see . '' 
In her first excitement Mrs. Livingstone had forgotten to ask who was the bearer of ` Lena 's letter , but remembering it now , she put the question . 
` Lena would not implicate Durward without his permission , but while she hesitated , he answered for her , `` Icarried that letter , Mrs. Livingstone , though I did not then know its nature . 
Miss ` Lena ; better have submitted to my terms at once , for do n't you see I have you in my power ? '' 
I like ` Lena . 
Sincethe morning when Durward had so boldly avowed himself ` Lena 's champion , her health and spirits began to improve . 
That she was not wholly indifferent to him she had every reason to believe , and notwithstanding the strong barrier between them , hope sometimes whispered to her of a future , when all that was now so dark and mysterious should be made plain . 
But while she was thus securely dreaming , a cloud , darker and deeper than any which had yet overshadowed her , was gathering around her pathway . 
Gradually had the story of her ride to Captain Atherton 's gained circulation , magnifying itself as it went , until at last it was currently reported that at several different times had she been seen riding away from Sunnyside at unseasonable hours of the night , the time varying from nine in the evening to three in the morning , according to the exaggerating powers of the informer . 
But few believed it , and yet such is human nature , that each and every one repeated it to his or her neighbor , until at last it reached Mrs. Graham , who , forgetting the caution of her son , said , with a very wise look , that `` shewas not at all surprised -- she had from the first suspected ` Lena , and she had the best of reasons for so doing ! '' 
Of course Mrs. Graham 's friend was exceedingly anxious to know what she meant , and by dint of quizzing , questioning , and promising never to tell , she at last drew out just enough of the story to know that Mr. Graham had a daguerreotype which looked just like ` Lena , and that Mrs. Graham had no doubt whatever that she was in the habit of writing to him . 
This was of course repeated , notwithstanding the promise of secrecy , and then many of the neighbors suddenly remembered some little circumstance , trivial in itself , but all going to swell the amount of evidence against poor ` Lena , who , unconscious of the gathering storm , did not for a time observe the sidelong glances cast toward her whenever she appeared in public . 
Erelong , however , the cool nods and distant manners of her acquaintances began to attract her attention , causing her to wonder what it meant . 
In his absence , Mrs. Graham felt no restraint , whatever , and all that she knew , together with many things that she did n't know , she told , until it became a matter of serious debate whether ` Lena ought not to be cutentirely . 
Mrs. Graham and her clique decided in the affirmative , and when Mrs. Fontaine , who was a weak woman , wholly governed by public opinion , gave a small party for her daughter Maria , ` Lena was purposely omitted . 
`` It 'll kill her stone dead , '' thought Mrs. Nichols , revolving in her own mind the propriety of telling ` Lena what her aunt had said . 
That afternoon several ladies , who were in the habit of calling upon ` Lena , came to Maple Grove , but not one asked for her , and with her eyes and ears now sharpened , she fancied that once , as she was passing the parlor door , she heard her own name coupled with that of Mr. Graham . 
A startling light burst upon her , and staggering to her room , she threw herself , half fainting , upon the bed , where an hour afterward she was found by Aunt Milly . 
The old negress had also heard the story in its most aggravated form , and readily divining the cause of ` Lena 's grief , attempted to console her , telling her `` not to mind what the good-for-nothin ' critters said ; they war only mad 'cause she 's so much handsomer and trimmer built . '' 
`` You know , then , '' said ` Lena , lifting her head from the pillow . 
demanded ` Lena ; and old Milly , seating herself upon a trunk , commenced : `` Why , honey , haint you hearn how you done got Mr. Graham 's pictur and gin him yourn long of one of them curls -- how he 's writ and you 've writ , and how he 's gone off to the eends of the airth to git rid on you -- and how you try to cotch young Mas ' r Durward , who hate the sight on you -- how you waylay him one day , settin ' on a rock out by the big gate -- and how you been seen mighty nigh fifty times comin ' home a foot from Captain Atherton 's in the night , rainin ' thunder and lightnin ' hard as it could pour -- how after you done got Miss Anna to ` lope , you ax Captain Atherton to have you , and git mad as fury 'cause he ` fuses -- and how your mother war n't none too likely , and a heap more that I ca n't remember -- hai n't you heard of none o n't ? '' 
`` None , none , '' answered ` Lena , while Milly continued : `` It 's a sin and shame for quality folks that belong to the meetin ' to pitch into a poor ` fenseless girl and pick her all to pieces . 
` Lena smiled in spite of herself , and when Milly , who arose to leave the room , again told her not to care , as all the blacks were for her , she felt that she was not utterly alone in her wretchedness . 
Still , the sympathy of the colored people alone could not help her , and daily matters grew worse , until at last even Nellie Douglass ' faith was shaken , and ` Lena 's heart died within her as she saw in her signs of neglect . 
Never had Mr. Livingstone exchanged a word with her upon the subject , but the reserve with which he treated her plainly indicated that he , too , was prejudiced , while her aunt and Carrie let no opportunity pass of slighting her , the latter invariably leaving the room if she entered it . 
On one such occasion , in a state bordering almost on distraction , ` Lena flew back to her own chamber , where to her great surprise , she found her uncle in close conversation with her grandmother , whose face told the pain his words were inflicting . 
` Lena 's first impulse was to fall at his feet and implore his protection , but he prevented her by immediately leaving the room . 
`` Oh , grandmother , grandmother , '' she cried , `` help me or I shall die . '' 
In her heart Mrs. Nichols believed her guilty , for John had said so -- he would not lie ; and to ` Lena 's touching appeal for sympathy , she replied , as she rocked to and fro , `` I wish you haddied , ` Leny , years and years ago . '' ' 
`` Poor sheared lamb , '' said she , gathering back the thick , clustering curls which shaded ` Lena 's marble face , `` she 's innocent as the new-born baby . '' 
`` Oh , if I could think so , '' said grandma ; but she could not , and when the soft brown eyes again unclosed , and eagerly sought hers , they read distrust and doubt , and motioning her grandmother away , ` Lena said she would rather be alone . 
Many and bitter were the thoughts which crowded upon her as she lay there watching the daylight fade from the distant hills , and musing of the stern realities around her . 
Gradually her thoughts assumed a definite purpose ; she would go away from a place where she was never wanted , and where she now no longer wished to stay . 
Mr. Everett had promised to be her friend , and to him she would go . 
At different intervals her uncle and cousin had given her money to the amount of twenty dollars , which was still in her possession , and which she knew would take her far on her road . 
With ` Lena to resolve was to do , and that night , when sure her grandmother was asleep , she arose and hurriedly made the needful preparations for her flight . 
Unlike most aged people , Mrs. Nichols slept soundly , and ` Lena had no fears of waking her . 
Very stealthily she moved around the room , placing in a sachel , which she could carry upon her arm , the few things she would need . 
`` And now dear , dear grandma , it costs me more pain to write than it will you to read All was at length ready , and then bending gently over the wrinkled face so calmly sleeping , ` Lena gazed through blinding tears upon each lineament , striving to imprint it upon her heart 's memory , and wondering if they would ever meet again . 
The hand which had so often rested caressingly upon her young head , was lying outside the counterpane , and with one burning kiss upon it she turned away , first placing the lamp by the window , where its light , shining upon her from afar , would be the last thing she could see of the home she was leaving . 
The road to Midway , the nearest railway station , was well known to her , and without once pausing , lest her courage should fail her , she pressed forward . 
The distance which she had to travel was about three and a half miles , and as she did not dare trust herself in the highway , she struck into the fields , looking back as long as the glimmering light from the window could be seen , and then when that home star had disappeared from view , silently imploring aid from Him who alone could help her now . 
She was in time for the cars , and though the depot agent looked curiously at her slight , shrinking figure , he asked no questions , and when the train moved rapidly away , ` Lena looked out upon the dark , still night , and felt that she was a wanderer in the world . 
On the pillow beside her rested no youthful head -- there was no kind voice bidding her `` good morrow '' -- no gentle hand ministering to her comfort -- for ` Lena was gone , and on the table lay the note , which at first escaped Mrs. Nichols ' attention . 
Corinda waited for no more , but darting through the hall and down the stairs , she rushed into the dining-room , announcing the startling news that `` old miss had done murdered Miss ` Lena , and hid her under the bed ! '' 
` Lena was gone , and the shock had for a time unsettled the poor old lady 's reason . 
The sight of his mother 's distress aroused all the better nature of Mr. Livingstone , and tenderly soothing her , he told her that ` Lena should be found -- he would go for her himself . 
Consequently , Mr. Livingstone returned each night , weary and disheartened , to his home , where all the day long his mother moaned and wept , asking for her ` Lena . 
At last , as day after day went by and brought no tidings of the wanderer , she ceased to ask for her , but whenever a stranger came to the house , she would whisper softly to them , `` ` Leny 's dead . 
` Lena was a general favorite in the neighborhood which had so recently denounced her , and when it became known that she was gone , there came a reaction , and those who had been the most bitter against her now changed their opinion , wondering how they could ever have thought her guilty . 
The stories concerning her visits to Captain Atherton 's were traced back to their source , resulting in exonerating her from all blame , while many things , hitherto kept secret , concerning Anna 's engagement , were brought to light , and ` Lena was universally commended for her efforts to save her cousin from a marriage so wholly unnatural . 
Public suspicion pointed to her as the intercepter of Anna 's letters , and though she did not deny it , she wondered what that had to do with ` Lena , at the same time asking `` how they expected to clear up the Graham affair . '' 
In Frankfort , where ` Lena 's flight was a topic of discussion , he had met with the depot agent , who was on his way home , and who spoke of the young girl whose rather singular manner had attracted his attention . 
This was undoubtedly ` Lena , and after a few moments ' conversation with his mother , Durward announced his intention of going after her , at least as far as Rockford , where he fancied she might have gone . 
To his surprise his mother made no objection , but her manner seemed so strange that he at last asked what was the matter . 
`` Nothing -- nothing in particular , '' said she , `` only I 've been thinking it all over lately , and I 've come to the conclusion that perhaps ` Lena is innocent after all . '' 
She hadheard -- she didknow ; but ere she could reply , the violent ringing of the door-bell , and the arrival of visitors , prevented her answer . 
In a perfect fever of excitement Durward glanced at his watch . 
If he waited long , he would be too late for the cars , and with a hasty adieu he left the parlor , turning back ere he reached the outer door , and telling his mother he must speak with her alone . 
He procured it in Cincinnati , and ` Lena I know was not there . '' 
I have examined both pictures closely , and I do not think they resemble ` Lena as much as we at first supposed . 
Possibly it might have been some one else , her mother , may be , '' and Mrs. Graham looked earnestly at her son , who rather impatiently answered , `` Her mother died years ago . '' 
At the same time he walked away , pondering upon what he had heard , and hoping , half believing , that ` Lena would yet be exonerated from all blame . 
For a moment the stranger hesitated , and then thinking it better to tell the truth at once , she replied , `` My name is ` Lena . 
There was something in her manner which silenced Aunt Betsey , who , erelong , proposed that she should go up stairs and lie down on a nice little bed , where she would be more quiet . 
But ` Lena refused , saying she should feel better soon . 
We 've got some roasted pork , and Hetty 'll warm over the gravy ; '' but ` Lena 's stomach rebelled at the very thought , seeing which , the landlady went back to the kitchen , where she soon prepared a bowl of gruel , in spite of the discouraging remarks of her husband , who , being a little after the Old Hunksorder , cautioned her `` not to fuss too much , as gals that run away war n't apt to be plagued with money . '' 
Fortunately , Aunt Betsey 's heart covered a broader sphere , and the moment the stage was gone she closed the door to shut out the dust , dropped the green curtains , and drawing from the spare-room a large , stuffed chair , bade ` Lena `` see if she could n't set up a minit . '' 
But this was impossible , and all that long , sultry afternoon she lay upon the lounge , holding her aching head , which seemed well-nigh bursting with its weight of pain and thought . 
Suppose she were to die there alone , among strangers and without money , for her scanty purse was well-nigh drained . '' 
These and similar reflections crowded upon her , until her brain grew wild and dizzy , and when at sunset the physician came again , he was surprised to find how much her fever had increased . 
`` She ought not to lie here , '' said he , as he saw how the loud shouts of the school-boys made her shudder . 
Its furniture was of the plainest kind , it being reserved for more common travelers , and here the landlord said ` Lena must be taken . 
`` A dollar a week , and cheap at that , '' muttered Uncle Tim , while Jerry , going out behind the wood-house , counted over his funds , sighing as he found them quite too small to meet the extra dollar per week , should she long continue ill . 
Hastily throwing on her loose-gown Aunt Betsey repaired to ` Lena 's room , where she found her sitting up in the bed , moaning , talking , and whispering , while the wild expression of her eyes betokened a disordered brain . 
exclaimed Mrs. Aldergrass , and without boot or shoe , Jerry ran off in his stocking-feet , alarming the physician , who immediately hastened to the inn , pronouncing ` Lena 's disease to be brain fever , as he had at first feared . 
Rapidly she grew worse , talking of her home , which was sometimes in Kentucky and sometimes in Massachusetts , where she said they had buried her mother . 
At other times she would ask Aunt Betsey to send for Durward when she was dead , and tell him how innocent she was . 
But as day after day went by , and ` Lena 's fever raged more fiercely , even Uncle Tim relented , and when she would beg of them to take her home and bury her by the side of Mabel , where Durward could see her grave , he would sigh , `` Poor critter , I wish you was to home , '' but whether this wish was prompted by a sincere desire to please ` Lena , or from a more selfish motive , we are unable to state . 
One morning , the fifth of ` Lena 's illness , she seemed much worse , talking incessantly and tossing from side to side , her long hair floating in wild disorder over her pillow , or streaming down her shoulders . 
`` Better be cut off than yanked off , '' said Aunt Betsey , on the morning when ` Lena in her frenzy would occasionally tear out handfulls of her shining hair and scatter it over the floor . 
Satisfied that she was doing right , she carefully approached the bedside , and taking one of the curls in her hand , was about to sever it , when ` Lena , divining her intentions , sprang up , and gathering up her hair , exclaimed , `` No , no , not these ; take everything else , but leave me my curls . 
At the side door below , the noonday stage was unloading its passengers , and as the tones of their voices came in at the open window , ` Lena suddenly grew calmer , and assuming a listening attitude , whispered , `` Hark ! 
But Aunt Betsey heard nothing , except her husband calling her to come down , and leaving ` Lena , who had almost instantly become quiet , to the care of a neighbor , she started for the kitchen , meeting in the lower hall with Hetty , who was showing one of the passengers to a room where he could wash and refresh himself after his dusty ride . 
`` She calls herself ` Lena , but the ` tother name I do n't know , and I guess she lives in Kentucky or Massachusetts . '' 
He had found her then -- his lost ` Lena -- sick , perhaps dying , and his heart gave one agonized throb as he thought , `` What if she should die ? 
And still , reason as he would , a something told him that all would yet be well , else , perhaps , he had never followed her . 
Believing she would stop at Mr. Everett 's , he had come on thus far , finding her where he least expected it , and spite of his fears , there was much of pleasure mingled with his pain as he thought how he would protect and care for her , ministering to her comfort , and softening , as far as possible , the disagreeable things which he saw must necessarily surround her . 
As he was entering the dining-room , he saw Jerry -- whose long , lank figure and original manner had afforded him much amusement during his ride -- handing a dozen or more oranges to Mrs. Aldergrass , saying , as he did so , `` They are for Miss ` Lena . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said Uncle Timothy , suddenly changing his opinion of ` Lena , whose want of money had made him sadly suspicious of her . 
`` Not just yet ; I would like a few moments ' conversation with your wife first , '' answered Durward . 
As soon as he was able to get in a word , Durward proceeded to ask her every particular concerning ` Lena 's illness , and whether she would probably recognize him should he venture into her presence . 
Durward signified his willingness , and following his landlady , he soon stood in the close , pent-up room , where , in an uneasy slumber , ` Lena lay panting for breath , and at intervals faintly moaning in her sleep . 
She had fearfully changed since last he saw her , and , with a groan , he bent over her , murmuring , `` My poor ` Lena , '' while he gently laid his cool , moist hand upon her burning brow . 
It will make me well . '' 
For a long time he sat by her , bathing her head and carefully removing from her face and neck the thick curls which Mrs. Aldergrass had thought to cut away . 
The smallness of her chamber troubled him , and when Mrs. Aldergrass came up he asked if there was no other apartment where ` Lena would be more comfortable . 
`` That 's something more like it , '' said ` Lena , and when he urged upon her the necessity of her removal , she asked , `` Will you go with me ? '' 
`` And stay with me ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Then I 'll go , '' she continued , stretching her arms toward him as a child toward its mother . 
For a long time ` Lena slept , watched by the physician , who , knowing that the crisis had arrived , waited anxiously for her waking , which came at last , bringing with it the light of returning reason . 
Dreamily she gazed about the room , and in a voice no longer strong with the excitement of delirium , asked , `` Where am I , and how came I here ? '' 
All this Aunt Betsey communicated to Durward , who , unwilling to do anything which would endanger ` Lena 's safety , kept himself aloof , treading softly and speaking low , for as if her hearing were sharpened by disease , she more than once , when he was talking in the hall below , started up , listening eagerly ; then , as if satisfied that she had been deceived , she would resume her position , while the flush on her cheek deepened as she thought , `` Oh , what if it had indeed been he ! '' 
Nearly all the day long he sat just without the door , holding his breath as he caught the faint tones of her voice , and longing for the hour when he could see her , and obtain , if possible , some clue to the mystery attending her and his father . 
His mother 's words , together with what he had heard ` Lena say in her ravings , had tended to convince him that she , at least , might be innocent , and once assured of this , he felt that he would gladly fold her to his bosom , and cherish her there as the choicest of heaven 's blessings . 
All this time ` Lena had no suspicion of his presence , but she wondered at the many luxuries which surrounded her , and once , when Mrs. Aldergrass offered her some choice wine , she asked who it was that supplied her with so many comforts . 
` Lena 's suspicions were at once aroused , and for more than an hour she lay thinking -- trying to recall something which seemed to her like a dream . 
`` Nobody , nobody -- I must n't tell , '' said Mrs. Aldergrass , hurriedly , while ` Lena continued , `` Was it Cousin John ? '' 
`` No , no ; do n't guess any more , '' was Mrs. Aldergrass ' reply , and ` Lena , clasping her hands together , exclaimed , `` Oh , could it be he . '' 
The words reached Durward 's ear , and nothing but a sense of the harm it might do prevented him from going at once to her bedside . 
That night , at his earnest request , the physician gave him permission to see her in the morning , and Mrs. Aldergrass was commissioned to prepare her for the interview . 
` Lena did not ask who it was ; she felt that she knew ; and the knowledge that hewas there -- that hehad cared for her -- operated upon her like a spell , soothing her into the most refreshing slumber she had experienced for many a weary week . 
A natural delicacy prevented ` Lena from objecting to the delay , and , as calmly as possible , she watched Mrs. Aldergrass while she put the room to rights , and then patiently submitted to the arranging of her curls , which during her illness had become matted and tangled . 
Before eight everything was in readiness , and soon after , worn out by her own exertions , ` Lena again fell asleep . 
Never before had ` Lena seemed so beautiful to him , and as he looked upon her , he felt his doubts removing , one by one . 
She was innocent -- it could not be otherwise -- and very impatiently he awaited the lapse of the two hours which must pass ere he could see her , face to face . 
Altogether too stingy to pay the coach fare , his own horse had carried him out , going for him on the night preceding Durward 's projected meeting with ` Lena . 
Many and many a time during his travels had the image of a pale , sad face arisen before him , accusing him of so long neglecting to own his child , for ` Lena was his daughter , and she , who in all her bright beauty had years ago gone down to an early grave , was his wife , the wife of his first , and in bitterness of heart he sometimes thought , of his only love . 
The reader already knows how ` Lena 's young mother watched for her recreant husband 's coming until life and hope died out together , and it is only necessary to repeat that part of the story which relates to Harry , who on his return home found his father much worse than he expected . 
They would reproach him , he thought , with the death of their daughter , whom he had so deeply wronged , and not possessing sufficient courage to meet them face to face , he again started for home , bearing a sad heart , which scarcely again felt a thrill of joy until the morning when he first met with ` Lena , whose exact resemblance to her mother so startled him as to arouse the jealousy of his wife . 
When he saw ` Lena , however , his first impulse was to clasp her in his arms and compel his wife to own her , but day after day went by , and he still delayed , hoping for a more favorable opportunity , which never came . 
Once it occurred to him that possibly he might die suddenly , thus leaving his relationship to her a secret forever , and acting upon this thought , he immediately made his will , bequeathing all to ` Lena , whom he acknowledged to be his daughter , adding an explanation of the whole affair , together with a most touching letter to his child , who would never see it until he was dead . 
This done , he felt greatly relieved , and each day found some good excuse for still keeping it from his wife , who worried him incessantly concerning his evident preference for ` Lena . 
Many and many a time he resolved to tell her all , but as often postponed the matter , until , with the broad Atlantic between them , he ventured to write what he could not tell her verbally , and , strange to say , the effect upon his wife was far different from what he had expected . 
Shehad helped to impair ` Lena 's reputation , and if disgrace attached to her , it would also fall upon her own family . 
Consequently , as we have seen , she set herself at work to atone , as far as possible , for her conduct . 
Her husband had given her permission to wait , if she chose , until his return , ere she made the affair public , and as she dreaded the remarks it would necessarily call forth , she resolved to do so . 
He had advised her to tell ` Lena , but she was gone -- no one knew whither , and nervously she waited for some tidings of the wanderer . 
She was willing to receive ` Lena , but not the grandmother ; shewas voted an intolerable nuisance , who should never darken the doors of Woodlawn -- never ! 
`` It 's ` Lena , '' answered Uncle Timothy , `` ` Lena Rivers that dandified chap calls her , and it 's plaguy curis to me what she 's a runnin ' away for , and he a streakin ' it through the country arter her ; there 's mischief summers , so I tell 'em , but that 's no consarn of mine so long as he pays down regular . '' 
In this way his progress homeward was not very rapid , and the clock had struck ten long ere they reached the inn , which they found still and dark , save the light which was kept burning in ` Lena 's room . 
Mr. Graham was very tired , and now scarcely had his head pressed the pillow ere he was asleep , dreaming of ` Lena , whose presence was to shed such a halo of sunlight over his hitherto cheerless home . 
In order to do this , it was necessary for him to pass ` Lena 's room , the door of which was ajar . 
A second call decided him , and in a moment he was at her bedside , clasping her in his arms , and exclaiming , `` My precious ` Lena ! 
My daughter!Has nothing ever told you that I am your father , the husband of your angel mother , who lives again in her child -- mychild -- my ` Lena ? '' 
For a moment ` Lena 's brain grew dizzy , and she had well-nigh fainted , when the sound of Mr. Graham 's voice again brought her back to consciousness . 
With lightning rapidity ` Lena 's thoughts traversed the past , whose dark mystery was now made plain , and as the thought that it mightbe so -- that it wasso -- flashed upon her , she clasped her hands together , exclaiming , `` My father ! 
I amyour father , and Helena Nichols was my wife . '' 
asked ` Lena . 
The hardest part was yet to come , but he met it manfully , telling her the whole story , sparing not himself in the least , and ending by asking if , after all this , she could forgive and love him as her father . 
Raising herself in bed , ` Lena wound her arms around his neck , and laying her face against his , wept like a little child . 
He felt that he was sufficiently answered , and holding her closer to his bosom , he pushed back the clustering curls , kissing her again and again , while he said aloud , `` I have your answer , dearest one ; we will never be parted again . '' 
Recoiling backward a step or two , he was just in time to see ` Lena as she threw herself into Mr. Graham 's arms -- in time to hear the tender words of endearment lavished upon her by his father ! 
Alone in his room , he grew calmer , though his heart still quivered with unutterable agony as he strode up and down the room , exclaiming , as he had once done before , `` I would far rather see her dead than thus -- my lost , lost ` Lena ! '' 
Then , in the deep bitterness of his spirit , he cursed his father , whom he believed to be far more guilty than she . 
Suiting the action to the word , he hastened down the stairs , glancing back once , and seeing ` Lena reclining upon his father 's arm , while her eyes were raised to his with a sweet , confiding smile , which told of perfect happiness . 
`` Thank God that I am unarmed , else he could not live , '' thought he , hurrying into the bar-room , where he placed in Uncle Timothy 's hands double the sum due for himself and ` Lena , and then , without a word of explanation , he walked away . 
He was a good pedestrian , and preferring solitude in his present state of feeling , he determined to go on foot to Canadaigua , a distance of little more than a dozen miles . 
Meantime , Mr. Graham was learning from ` Lena the cause of her being there , and though she , as far as possible , softened the fact of his having been accessory to her misfortunes , he felt it none the less keenly , and would frequently interrupt her with the exclamation that it was the result of his cowardice -- his despicable habit of secrecy . 
When she spoke of the curl which his wife had burned , he seemed deeply affected , groaning aloud as he hid his face in his hands . 
But , '' he added , `` I can bear it better now that I have you , her living image , for what she was when last I saw her , you are now . '' 
`` He is worthy of you , '' said he , while ` Lena , without seeming to heed the remark , said , `` I have not seen him yet , but I am expecting him every moment , for he was to visit me this morning . '' 
At this juncture Mrs. Aldergrass , who had been at one of her neighbor 's , came in , appearing greatly surprised at the sight of the stranger , whom ` Lena quietly introduced as `` her father , '' while Mr. Graham colored painfully as Mrs. Aldergrass , curtsying very low , hoped Mr. Riverswas well ! 
`` Let it go so , '' whispered ` Lena , as she saw her father about to speak . 
Upon reflection , Mr. Graham concluded so , too , and returning to ` Lena , he sat by her all day , soothing her with assurances that Durward would surely come back , as there was no possible reason for his leaving them so abruptly . 
Taking the package , Mr. Graham repaired to ` Lena 's room , giving her her letter , and then reading his , which was full of bitterness , denouncing him as a villain , and cautioning him , as he valued his life , never again to cross the track of his outraged step-son . 
`` You have robbed me , '' he wrote , `` of all I hold most dear , and while I do not censure her the less , I blame you the more , for you are older in experience , older in years , and ten-fold older in sin , and I know you must have used every art your foul nature could suggest , ere you won my lost ` Lena from the path of rectitude . '' 
In the utmost astonishment Mr. Graham looked up at ` Lena , who had fainted . 
It was long ere she returned to consciousness , and then her fainting fit was followed by another more severe , if possible , than the first , while in speechless agony Mr. Graham hung over her . 
But at last ` Lena seemed better , and taking from the pillow the crumpled note , she passed it toward her father , bidding him read it . 
It was as follows : `` My Lost ` Lena : By this title it seems appropriate for me to call you , for you are more surely lost to me than you would be were this summer sun shining upon your grave . 
And , ` Lena , believe me when I say I would rather , far rather , see you dead than the guilty thing you are , for then your memory would be to me as a holy , blessed influence , leading me on to a better world , where I could hope to greet you as my spirit bride . 
`` Oh , ` Lena , ` Lena , how could you deceive me thus , when I thought you so pure and innocent , when even now , I would willingly lay down my life could that save you from ruin . 
`` And now , my once loved , but erring ` Lena , farewell . 
And yet , ` Lena , there will come a time when you 'll remember one who , had you remained true to yourself , would have devoted his life to make you happy , for I know I am not indifferent to you . 
Time hastens , and I must say farewell -- farewell forever -- my lost , lost ` Lena ! 
he might at least have spoken with me , '' said he , as he finished the letter , but ` Lena would hear no word of censure against him . 
She did not blame him . 
She saw it all , understood it all , and as she recalled the contents of his letter , her own heart sadly echoed , `` lost forever . '' 
As well as he was able , Mr. Graham tried to comfort her , but in spite of his endeavors , there was still at her heart the same dull , heavy pain , and most anxiously Mr. Graham watched her , waiting impatiently for the time when she would be able to start for home , as he hoped a change of place and scene would do much toward restoring both her health and spirits . 
This part of the letter he showed to ` Lena , who , after reading it , seemed for a long time absorbed in thought . 
Mr. Graham asked , at length , and ` Lena , taking the hand which he had laid gently upon her forehead , replied , `` I am thinking of poor grandmother . 
timidly inquired ` Lena , involuntarily shrinking from the very thought of coming in contact with the little lady , who had so recently come up before her in the new and formidable aspect of step-mother ! 
Some such thoughts passed through his mind , but it would not be proper , he knew , to express himself thus to ` Lena , so he laughingly replied , `` Oh , we 'll fix that , easily enough . '' 
At the time he wrote to Mr. Livingstone , he had also sent a letter to his wife , announcing his safe return from Europe , and saying that he should be at home as soon as ` Lena 's health would admit of her traveling . 
Very frankly she confessed the unkind part she had acted toward ` Lena , and while she said she was sorry , she also spoke of the reaction which had taken place in the minds of Lena 's friends , who , she said , would gladly welcome her back . 
The continued absence of Durward was now the only drawback to ` Lena 's happiness , and with a comparatively light heart , she began to anticipate her journey home . 
Most liberally did Mr. Graham pay for both himself and ` Lena , and Uncle Timothy , as he counted the shining coin , dropping it upon the table to make sure it was not bogus , felt quite reconciled to his recent loss of fifty dollars . 
For the sake of occasionally seeing ` Lena , whom he considered as something more than mortal , Jerry would gladly have gone , but he was a staunch abolitionist , dyed in the wool , and scratching his head , he replied , `` I 'm obleeged to you , but I b ` lieve I 'd rather drive hossesthan niggers ! '' 
`` Mebby you could run one on 'em off , and so make a little sumthin ' , '' slily whispered Uncle Timothy , his eyes always on the main chance , but it was no part of Jerry 's creed to make anything , and as ` Lena at that moment appeared , he beat a precipitate retreat , going out behind the church , where he watched the departure of his southern friends , saying afterward , to Mrs. Aldergrass , who chided him for his conduct , that `` he never could bid nobody good-by , he was so darned tender-hearted ! '' 
During his absence Carrie had been his only correspondent , and for some reason or other she delayed telling him of ` Lena 's flight until quite recently . 
`` Shut up your head , '' roared John Jr. `` ` Lena is no more guilty than you.By George , I ` most cried when I heard how nobly she worked to save Anna from old Baldhead . 
answered John Jr. , while his father suggested that they stop quarreling , adding , as an apology for his own neglect , that Durward had gone after ` Lena , who was probably at Mr. Everett 's , and that he himself had advertised in all the principal papers . 
He 's a fine fellow and deserves ` Lena , if anybody does , '' exclaimed John Jr. , while Carrie chimed in , `` Pshaw ! 
Perfectly rational on all other subjects , Mrs. Nichols still persisted in saying of ` Lena , that she had killed her , and now , when her first greeting with John Jr. was over , she whispered in his ear ; `` Have they told you ` Leny was dead ? 
Rough as he seemed at times , there was in John Jr. 's nature many a tender spot , and when he saw the look of childish imbecility on his grandmother 's face , he pressed his strong arm around her , and a tear actually dropped upon her gray hair as he told her ` Lena was not dead -- he was going to find her and bring her home . 
`` Perhaps heknows something of ` Lena ! '' 
and she looked meaningly at her mother , who , with a peculiar twist of her mouth , replied , `` Very likely . '' 
He doesknow something of her , '' said Mr. Livingstone , as he finished reading the letter . 
I must go and see her immediately , '' exclaimed Mrs. Livingstone , settling herself back quite composedly in her chair , while Carrie , turning to her brother , asked `` what he thought of ` Lena now . '' 
`` Who do you think ` Lena 's father is ? 
No less a person than Mr. Graham himself ! 
Now taunt her again , Cad , with her low origin , if you like . 
She is n't coming here to live any more . 
By this time Carrie had comforted herself with the assurance , that as ` Lena was now Durward 's sister , he would not , of course , marry her , and determining to make the best of it , she replied to her brother , who rallied her on her crest-fallen looks , that he was greatly mistaken , for `` she was as pleased as any one at ` Lena 's good fortune , but it did not follow that she must make a fool of herself , as some others did . '' 
In the first excitement , he had thought `` how glad Nellie will be , '' and acting , as he generally did , upon impulse , he now ordered his horse , and dashing off at full speed , as usual , surprised Nellie , first with his sudden appearance , second , with his announcement of ` Lena 's parentage , and third , by an offer of himself ! 
But for once in her life Mrs. Graham did well , and to their astonishment , replied , `` Oh , I hope not , for you do not know how I long for the society of a daughter , and as Mr. Graham 's child I shall gladly welcome ` Lena home , trying , if possible , to overlook the vulgarity of her family friends ! '' 
If Mrs. Graham could so soon change her tactics , so could they , and for the next half hour they lauded ` Lena to the skies . 
Pausing in the door-way , she said , `` Would it afford you any gratification to be at Woodlawn when ` Lena arrives ? '' 
Knowing that , under the circumstances , it would look better , Mrs. Livingstone said `` yes , '' while Carrie , thinking Durward would be there , made a similar reply , saying `` she was exceedingly anxious to see her cousin . '' 
The news of ` Lena 's good fortune had reached the kitchen , causing much excitement , for she was a favorite there . 
Not knowing how he would like it , they all took to their heels , except Thomas Jefferson , who , having some of his mother 's spirit , stood his ground , replying , when asked what they were about , that they were `` gwine to celebrate Miss ` Lena . '' 
Accordingly , as she was conducting Mrs. Livingstone and Carrie to ` Lena 's room , she casually remarked , `` I 've made no provision for Mrs. Nichols , except as an occasional visitor , for of course she will remain with her son . 
`` This ` Lena 's ! '' 
`` It 's the very best chamber in the house -- Brussels carpets , marble and rosewood furniture , damask curtains . 
`` Yes , this is ` Lena 's , '' said Mrs. Graham , complacently . 
`` Have I told you , '' continued Mrs. Graham , bent on tormenting them , `` Have I told you that we are to spend the winter in New Orleans , where ` Lena will of course be the reigning belle ? 
You ought to be there , dear , '' laying her hand on Carrie 's shoulder . 
`` It would be so gratifying to you to witness the sensation she will create ! '' 
`` Spiteful old thing -- she tries to insult us , '' thought Carrie , her heart swelling with bitterness toward the ever-hated ` Lena , whose future life seemed so bright and joyous . 
But only Mr. Graham alighted , gently lifting out his daughter , who was still an invalid . 
In a moment ` Lena 's soft , white hand lay in the fat , chubby one of Mrs. Graham , who kissed her pale cheek , calling her `` ` Lena , '' and saying `` she was welcome to Woodlawn . '' 
Mr. Livingstone 's turn came next , but he neither kissed nor caressed her , for that was not in keeping with his nature , but very , very tenderly he looked into her eyes , as he said , `` You know , ` Lena , that Iam glad -- most glad for you . '' 
Unostentatious as was this greeting , ` Lena felt that there was more sincerity in it than all that had gone before , and the tears gushed forth involuntarily . 
Mentally styling her , the one `` a baby , '' and the other `` a fool , '' Mrs. Livingstone and Carrie returned to the parlor , while Mrs. Graham , calling a servant , bade her show ` Lena to her room . 
`` Had n't you better go up and assist your cousin , '' whispered Mrs. Livingstone to Carrie , who forthwith departed , knocking at the door , an act of politeness she had never before thought it necessary to offer ` Lena . 
But she was an heiress , now , fully , yes , more than equal , and that made a vast difference . 
`` I came to see if I could render you any service , '' she said , in answer to ` Lena 's look of inquiry . 
`` No I thank you , '' returned ` Lena , beginning to get an inkling of the truth . 
`` You know I 'm accustomed to waiting upon myself , and if I wa n't anything , Drusa can assist me . 
I 've only to change my soiled dress and smooth my hair , '' she continued , as she shook out her long and now rather rough tresses . 
`` A course of fever is not usually very beneficial to one 's hair , I believe , '' answered ` Lena , as she proceeded to brush and arrange her wavy locks , which really had lost some of their luster . 
Foiled in her attempt at toadyism , Carrie took another tack . 
Looking ` Lena in the face , she said , `` What is it ? 
I ca n't make it out , but -- but somehow you 've changed ; you do n't look so -- so -- '' `` So wellyou would say , I suppose , '' returned ` Lena , laughingly , `` I 've grown thin , but I hope to improve by-and-by . '' 
Drusa glanced at the two girls as they stood side by side , and her large eyes sparkled as she thought her young mistress `` a heap the best lookin ' now . '' 
By this time Carrie had thought to ask for Durward . 
Instantly ` Lena turned whiter , if possible , than she was before , and in an unsteady voice she replied , that `` she did not know . '' 
`` Yes , but he left before I saw him , '' returned ` Lena , her manner plainly indicating that there was something wrong . 
There was a chance for her , and on their way down stairs she laughed and chatted so familiarly , that ` Lena wondered if it could be the same haughty girl who had seldom spoken to her except to repulse or command her . 
The supper-bell-rang just as they reached the parlor , and Mr. Graham , taking ` Lena on his arm , led the way to the dining-room , where the entire silver tea-set had been brought out , in honor of the occasion . 
`` Has n't ` Lena changed , mother ? '' 
said Carrie , feeling hateful , and knowing no better way of showing it . 
`` Eighteen , '' was ` Lena 's answer , to which Mrs. Graham replied , `` I thought so . 
repeated John Jr. `` What have you done with him , ` Lena ? '' 
Lifting her eyes , full of tears , to her cousin 's face , ` Lena said , softly , `` Please do n't talk about it now . '' 
`` There 's something wrong , '' thought John Jr. `` I 'll bet I 'll have to shoot that dog yet . '' 
` Lena longed to pour out her troubles to some one , and knowing she could confide in John Jr. , she soon found an opportunity of whispering to him , `` Come to-morrow , and I will tell you all about it . '' 
Between ten and eleven the company departed , Mrs. Livingstone and Carrie taking a most affectionate leave of ` Lena , urging her not to fail of coming over the next day , as they should be expecting her . 
The ludicrous expression of John Jr. 's face was a sufficient interpretation of his thoughts , as whispering aside to ` Lena , he said , `` I ca n't do it justice if I try ! '' 
The next morning Mr. Graham got out his carriage to carry ` Lena to Maple Grove , asking his wife to accompany them . 
But she excused herself , on the plea of a headache , and they set off without her . 
The meeting between ` Lena and her grandmother was affecting , and Carrie , in order to sustain the character she had assumed , walked to the window , to hide her emotions , probably -- at least John Jr. . 
When the first transports of her interview with ` Lena were over , Mrs. Nichols fastened herself upon Mr. Graham , while John Jr. invited ` Lena to the garden , where he claimed from her the promised story , which she told him unreservedly . 
Involuntarily ` Lena 's eyes wandered in the direction of the sunny slope and the little grave , as yet but nine months made . 
So it was arranged that she should go with him , and when ` Lena returned to the house , she found her grandmother in her chamber , packing up , preparatory to her departure . 
`` Do n't take them , '' interposed ` Lena . 
`` You wo n't need them , and nothing will harm them here . '' 
adding , by way of comfort , that `` she was going to Frankfort the next day to make purchases for ` Lena , and would take her home . '' 
Accordingly , the next morning Mrs. Livingstone was not very agreeably surprised by the return of her mother-in-law , who , Mrs. Graham said , `` was so homesick they could n't keep her . '' 
There was no particular disease , but a general breaking up of the springs of life , and a few weeks after ` Lena 's arrival at Woodlawn , they made another grave on the sunny slope , and Mabel no longer slept alone . 
Constantly in terror lest he should hear of ` Lena 's disgrace , which he felt sure would be published to the world , he had , since his departure from Laurel Hill , resolutely refrained from looking in a newspaper , until one morning some weeks after his arrival at Richmond . 
Now I 'm pretty good at figgerin ' , and I 've thought that matter over until I 've come to this conclusion -- that man -- was -- ` Lena 's father -- the husband or something of Helleny Nichols ! 
He remembered how sad he had seemed after his return , neglecting to play with him as had been his wont , and when to this he added Joel 's story , together with the singularity of his father 's conduct toward ` Lena , he could not fail to be convinced . 
Wehope the reader does not expect us to describe the meeting between Durward and ` Lena , for we have not the least , or , at the most , only a faint idea of what took place . 
We only know that it occurred in the summer-house at the foot of the garden , whither ` Lena had fled at the first intimation of his arrival , and that on her return to the house , after an interview of two whole hours , there were on her cheeks traces of tears , which the expression of her face said were not tears of grief . 
`` How do you like my daughter ? '' 
Kind and affectionate as she tried to be toward ` Lena , Mrs. Graham had not yet fully conquered her olden prejudice , and had the matter been left wholly with herself , she would , perhaps , have chosen for her son a bride in whose veins no plebeian bloodwas flowing ; but she well knew that her objections would have no weight , whatever , and very wisely she answered , that `` she should interpose no impediment to his marriage with her husband 's daughter . '' 
`` Then it is settled , '' said he , `` and four weeks from to-night I shall claim ` Lena for my own . '' 
`` No , no , not so soon after poor grandma 's death , '' said ` Lena , her tears flowing afresh at the mention of her loss . 
`` If grandma could speak , she would tell you not to wait , '' urged Durward ; but ` Lena was decided , and the most that she would promise was , that early in the spring she would thinkabout it ! 
`` I 'll never wait so long as that ! '' 
but for the present he forebore pressing her further on the subject , consoling himself with the reflection that he should , at least , have her in the house with him , which would in a great measure relieve the tedium of waiting the prescribed length of time . 
During the autumn , his entire devotion to ` Lena , whom he would hardly suffer to be out of his sight , furnished Carrie with a subject for very many ill-natured remarks concerning the `` sickishactions of newly engaged people . '' 
`` I declare , '' said she , one evening after the departure of Durward , ` Lena , and Nellie , who had all been spending the day at Maple Grove , `` I declare , I 'm perfectly disgusted , and if this is a specimen , I hope I shall never be engaged . '' 
She had received news of Durward 's engagement much better than , under the circumstances , could have been expected , and when some of her acquaintances joked her on the subject , asking why she did not marry Durward herself , she replied , as was very true , that `` heknew and sheknew , '' saying further , that there were some good things about him , and she presumed he would be tolerably happy with Cousin ` Lena , as they were somewhat alike ! 
Very naturally , too , she took to quoting and cousining ` Lena , while John Jr. seldom let an opportunity pass of hinting at the very recent date of her admiration of Miss Graham . 
Mrs. Graham had proposed spending the winter in New Orleans , but to this Durward objected . 
He wanted ` Lena all to himself , he said , and as she seemed perfectly satisfied to remain where she was , the project was given up , Mrs. Graham contenting herself with anticipating the splendid entertainment she would give at the wedding , which was to take place about the last of March . 
`` Anything but that , '' said she , dashing away the angry tears , as she thought how ` Lena had supplanted her in the affections of the only person she could ever love . 
`` Old Marster Atherton done want to see you in the parlor , '' said Corinda , putting her woolly head in at the door , and interrupting her young mistress ' reflections . 
At this moment , the handsome carriage of Mrs. Graham drew up , and from it alighted ` Lena , richly clad in velvets and costly furs . 
He was both able and willing to grant her slightest wish , and as his wife , she could compete with , if not outdo , ` Lena in the splendor of her surroundings . 
Like Durward , Captain Atherton was in a hurry , and as Carrie 's chief desire was to be married before ` Lena , thus preventing John Jr. from teasing her about being left in the rear , it was decided that the wedding should take place just one week before the time appointed for that of her cousin . 
Did Mrs. Graham purchase for ` Lena a costly silk , Mrs. Livingstone forthwith secured a piece of similar quality , but different pattern , for Carrie . 
Carrie had decided upon a tour to Europe , and the captain had given his consent , when it was currently reported that Durward and ` Lena were also intending to sail for Liverpool . 
The next day ` Lena came , overjoyed to meet Anna , who , since the night of her elopement , had looked upon her with a species of adoration , and who , perhaps more than any one else , rejoiced in her good fortune . 
`` No one cared to see ` Lena married . 
At first Mrs. Livingstone hesitated , but when the bride of four days burst into a passionate fit of weeping , declaring `` she 'd kill herself if she had to stay much longer at Sunnyside and be petted by that old fool , '' she consented , and one week from the day of their marriage they started . 
And without a word of opposition the captain picked up his things , paid his bills , and started for Kentucky , leaving his wife at Maple Grove , she giving as a reason that `` ma could not spare her yet . '' 
Far different from this were the future prospects of Durward and ` Lena , who with perfect love in their hearts were made one , a week after the departure of Captain Atherton for California . 
In the style of her dress ` Lena had followed the dictates of her own good taste , rather than the wishes of Mrs. Graham , and the assembled guests unanimously pronounced her the most beautiful bride they had ever seen . 
It had been decided that he should accompany Durward and ` Lena to Europe , and a day or two after his marriage he asked Mr. Everett to go , too . 
After a little reflection Malcolm concluded to accept John 's offer , and a happier , more merry party never stepped on board a steamer than that which , on the 15th of April , sailed for Europe , which they reached in safety , being at the last accounts in Paris , where Durward 's high English blood had already procured for them an acquaintance with the emperor and empress , ` Lena having come to the honor of actually kissingthe Prince of Algiers , while Nellie and Anna contented themselves with a look at the dress of the royal infant , John Jr. slily bidding them take pattern ! 
During the absence of their children , Mr. and Mrs. Graham remain at Woodlawn , which , as it is the property of Durward , will be his own and ` Lena 's home , his parents going back to Louisville .
