One niece still remained unmarried -- Belinda Portman , of whom she was determined to get rid with all convenient expedition . 
Belinda was handsome , graceful , sprightly , and highly accomplished ; her aunt had endeavoured to teach her , that a young lady 's chief business is to please in society , that all her charms and accomplishments should be invariably subservient to one grand object -- the establishing herself in the world . 
Mrs. Stanhope did not find Belinda such a docile pupil as her other nieces , for she had been educated chiefly in the country ; she had early been inspired with a taste for domestic pleasures ; she was fond of reading , and disposed to conduct herself with prudence and integrity . 
After manoeuvering with more than her usual art , she succeeded in fastening Belinda upon the fashionable lady Delacour for the season . 
Her ladyship was so much pleased by miss Portman 's accomplishments and vivacity , as to invite her to spend the winter with her in London . 
Soon after her arrival in town , Belinda received the following letter from her aunt Stanhope . 
Besides , he is a man of wit and gallantry , quite a connoisseur in female grace and beauty -- just the man to bring a new face into fashion -- So my dear Belinda , I make it a point -- look well when he is introduced to you , and remember , what I have so often told you , that nobody can look well without taking some pains to please . 
-- My dearest Belinda , may this never be your case ! 
-- Adieu , my dear Belinda , Yours very sincerely , Selina Stanhope . '' 
Mrs. Stanhope 's perpetual anxiety about her niece 's appearance , manners , and establishment had completely worn out Belinda 's patience ; she had become more insensible to the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments , than young women of her age usually are , because she had been so much flattered and shown off , as it is called , by her match-making aunt . 
-- Yet Belinda was fond of amusement , and had imbibed some of Mrs. Stanhope 's prejudices in favour of rank and fashion . 
Such was the light in which her ladyship appeared , not only to Belinda , but to all the world -- that is to say , all the world of fashion , and she knew of no other . 
To be seen in public with lady Delacour , to be a visitor at her house , were privileges , of which numbers were vehemently ambitious ; and Belinda Portman was congratulated and envied by all her acquaintance , for being admitted as an inmate . 
How could she avoid thinking herself singularly fortunate ? 
A short time after her arrival at lady Delacour 's , Belinda began to see through the thin veil , with which politeness covers domestic misery . 
For some days after Belinda 's arrival in town , she heard nothing of lord Delacour ; his lady never mentioned his name , except once accidentally , as she was showing miss Portman the house , she said -- `` Do n't open that door -- those are only lord Delacour 's apartments . '' 
-- The first time Belinda ever saw his lordship , he was dead drunk in the arms of two footmen , who were carrying him up stairs to his bedchamber ; his lady , who was just returned from Ranelagh , passed by him on the landing place with a look of sovereign contempt . 
said Belinda . 
`` Only the body of my lord Delacour , '' said her ladyship -- `` his bearers have brought it up the wrong staircase -- take it down again , my good friends -- let his lordship go his own way -- do n't look so shocked and amazed , Belinda -- do n't look so new , child -- this funeral of my lord 's intellects is to me a nightly , or , '' added her ladyship , looking at her watch and yawning -- `` I believe I should say a daily ceremony . 
The next morning , as her ladyship and miss Portman were sitting at the breakfast table , after a very late breakfast , lord Delacour entered the room . 
`` Lord Delacour -- sober , my dear , '' -- said her ladyship to miss Portman , by way of introducing him . 
Lord Delacour , sober , did not appear to Belinda more agreeable or more rational , than lord Delacour drunk . 
whispered her ladyship , as she saw Belinda 's eye fixed upon the trembling hand , which carried his teacup to his lips -- `` I 'll lay you a wager , '' continued she , aloud -- `` I 'll lay your birth-night dress , gold fringe , and yellow laurel wreaths into the bargain , that you do n't guess right . '' 
`` I 'll give you six guesses , and I 'll bet you do n't come within sixteen years , '' -- pursued her ladyship , still looking at Belinda . 
`` Then you wo n't venture to guess , Belinda , '' said her ladyship , -LRB- without honouring her lord with the smallest portion of her attention -RRB- -- `` Well , I believe you are right -- for certainly you would guess him to be six and sixty , instead of six and thirty -- but then he can drink more than any two legged animal in his majesty 's dominions ; and you know that is an advantage , which is well worth twenty or thirty years of a man 's life -- especially to persons , who have no other chance of distinguishing themselves . '' 
`` To that of others -- his lordship means , if he means any thing -- Apropos -- Belinda -- did not you tell me Clarence Hervey is coming to town ? 
Belinda shocked , and in a great confusion , rose to leave the room , dreading the gross continuance of this matrimonial dialogue . 
`` Mr. Hervey , my lady , '' said a footman , opening the door ; and he was scarcely announced , when her ladyship went forward to receive him with an air of easy familiarity -- `` Where have you buried yourself , Hervey , this age past ? '' 
cried she , shaking hands with him -- `` There 's absolutely no living in this most stupid of all worlds , without you , Mr. Hervey -- miss Portman -- but do n't look as if you were half asleep , man -- What are you dreaming of Clarence ? 
said her ladyship in a similar tone -- Clarence went on -- `` O lord , methought what pain it was to dance ! 
`` I know where you have been now , and I pity you -- But sit down , '' said she , making room for him between Belinda and herself upon the sofa -- `` Sit down here , and tell me what could take you to that odious Mrs. Luttridge 's . '' 
`` But my dream has made me forget myself , strangely , '' said Mr. Hervey , turning to Belinda , and producing her bracelet , `` Mrs. Stanhope promised me , that if I delivered it safely , I should be rewarded by the honour of putting it on the owner 's fair arm . '' 
A conversation now took place on the nature of ladies ' promises -- on fashionable bracelets -- on the size of the arm of the Venus de Medicis -- on lady Delacour 's , and miss Portman 's -- on the thick legs of ancient statues -- and on the various defects and absurdities of Mrs. Luttridge and her wig . 
-- On all these topics Mr. Hervey displayed much wit , gallantry , and satire , with so happy an effect , that Belinda , when he took leave , was precisely of her aunt 's opinion , that he was a most uncommonly pleasant young man . 
He was constantly of all her ladyship 's parties , in public and private ; consequently he saw Belinda almost every day , and every day he saw her with increasing admiration of her beauty , and with increasing dread of being taken in , to marry a niece of `` the catch-match-maker ; '' the name by which Mrs. Stanhope was known among the men of his acquaintance . 
If he had not been prejudiced by the character of her aunt , Mr. Hervey would have thought Belinda an undesigning , unaffected girl ; but now he suspected her of artifice in every word , look , and motion ; and even when he felt himself most charmed by her powers of pleasing , he was most inclined to despise her for what he thought such premature proficiency in scientific coquetry . 
He had not sufficient resolution , to keep beyond the sphere of her attraction ; but frequently , when he found himself within it , he cursed his folly , and drew back with sudden terrour . 
His manner towards her was so variable and inconsistent , that she knew not how to interpret it 's language . 
Sometimes she fancied , that with all the eloquence of eyes he said , `` I adore you , Belinda ; '' at other times she imagined , that his guarded silence meant to warn her , that he was so entangled by lady Delacour , that he could not extricate himself from her snares . 
Belinda 's newly acquired moral sense was so much shocked , that she actually wrote a full statement of her observations , and her scruples , to her aunt Stanhope , concluding by a request , that she might not remain under the protection of a lady , whose character she could not approve , and whose intimacy might perhaps be injurious to her reputation , if not to her principles . 
Mrs. Stanhope answered Belinda 's letter in a very guarded style ; she rebuked her niece severely for her imprudence in mentioning names in such a manner , in a letter sent by the common post ; assured her , that her reputation was in no danger ; that she hoped no niece of hers would set up for a prude ; a character more suspected by men of the world , than even that of a coquette ; that the person aluded to was a perfectly fit chaperon for any young lady to appear with in public , as long as she was visited by the first people in town ; that as to any thing in the private conduct of that person , and as to any private brouilleries between her and her lord , Belinda should observe , on these dangerous topics , a profound silence , both in her letters , and her conversation ; that as long as the lady continued under the protection of her husband , the world might whisper , but would not speak out ; that as to Belinda 's own principles , she would be utterly inexcusable , if , after the education she had received , they could be hurt by any bad examples ; that she could not be too cautious in her management of a man of -- 's character that she could have no serious cause for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended , as marriage there could not be the object ; and there was such a difference of age , that no permanent influence could probably be obtained by the lady ; that the most certain method for miss Portman to expose herself to the ridicule of one of the parties , and to the total neglect of the other , would be to betray anxiety or jealousy : that , in short , if she were fool enough to lose her own heart , there would be little chance of her being wise enough to win that of -- , who was evidently a man of gallantry rather than of sentiment , and who was known to play his cards well , and to have good luck , whenever hearts were trumps . 
Belinda 's fears of lady Delacour , as a dangerous rival , were much quieted by the artful insinuations of Mrs. Stanhope , with respect to her age , & c. and in proportion , as her fears subsided , she blamed herself for her having written too harshly of her ladyship 's conduct . 
The idea , that whilst she appeared as lady Delacour 's friend , she ought not to propagate any stories to her disadvantage , operated powerfully upon Belinda 's mind , and she reproached herself for having told , even her aunt , what she had seen in private . 
She thought that she had been guilty of treachery , and she wrote again immediately to Mrs. Stanhope , to conjure her to burn her last letter , to forget , if possible , it 's contents , and to believe , that not a syllable of a similar nature should ever more be heard from her : she was just concluding with the words -- `` I hope my dear aunt will consider all this an an errour of my judgment , and not of my heart , '' -- when lady Delacour burst into the room , exclaiming , in a tone of gayety -- `` Tragedy or comedy , Belinda ? 
added she , looking full in Belinda 's face -- `` tears in the eyes ! 
`` No love-letters , indeed , lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , holding the paper fast , as her ladyship , half in play , half in earnest , attempted to snatch it from her . 
-- and her ladyship absolutely seized the letters by force , in spite of all Belinda 's struggles and entreaties . 
cried miss Portman , clasping her hands . 
and she threw herself upon her knees . 
As she spoke , lady Delacour opened Mrs. Stanhope 's letter , read it from beginning to end , folded it up coolly when she had finished it , and simply said , `` the person alluded to is almost as bad as her name at full length : does Mrs. Stanhope think no one can make out an innuendo in a libel , or fill up a blank , but an attorney general ? '' 
Belinda was in too much confusion , either to speak or think . 
`` You were right to swear they were not love-letters , '' pursued her ladyship , laying down the papers . 
`` Nay -- I beg -- I wish -- I insist upon your reading mine , '' said Belinda . 
When lady Delacour had read it , her countenance suddenly changed -- `` Worth a hundred of your aunt 's , I declare , '' said she , patting Belinda 's cheek . 
Lady Delacour spoke with a tone of feeling which Belinda had never heard from her before , and which at this moment touched her so much , that she took her ladyship 's hand and kissed it . 
`` Of that , '' said Belinda , with a constrained smile , `` he gives the most convincing proof , by his adrairing your ladyship so much . '' 
`` And by his admiring miss Portman so much more . 
`` I am-afraid I have not spirits enough to undertake the comic muse , '' said miss Portman . 
`` Your ladyship 's taller than miss Portman by half a head , '' said Marriott , `` and to be sure will best become tragedy , with this long train ; besides , I 'd settled all the rest of your ladyship 's dress . 
Tragedy , they say , is always tall , and , no offence , your ladyships ' taller than miss Portman by half a head . '' 
`` Miss Portman , '' continued her ladyship , `` do n't talk of not having spirits -- you that are all life and spirits ! 
-- What say you , Belinda ? 
Upon many occasions miss Portman had observed , that Marriott exercised despotic authority over her mistress ; and she had seen , with surprise , that a lady , who would not yield an iota of power to her husband , submitted herself to every caprice of the most insolent of waiting-women . 
For some time , Belinda imagined that this submission was merely an air , as she had seen some other fine ladies proud of appearing to be governed by a favourite maid ; but she was soon convinced , that Marriott was no favourite with lady Delacour ; that her ladyship 's was not proud humility , but fear . 
This idea had occurred to miss Portman more than once ; but never so forcibly as upon the present occasion . 
There had always been some mystery about her ladyship 's toilette ; at certain hours doors were bolted , and it was impossible for any body but Marriott to obtain admission . 
Miss Portman at first imagined that lady Delacour dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets , but her ladyship 's rouge was so glaring , and her pearl powder was so obvious , that Belinda was convinced there must be some other cause for this toilette secresy . 
There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber , which lady Delacour called her boudoir , to which there was an entrance by a back stair-case ; but no one ever entered there but Marriott . 
One night , lady Delacour , after dancing with great spirit at a ball , at her own house , fainted suddenly ; miss Portman attended her to her bedchamber , but Marriott begged that her lady might be left alone with her , and she would by no means suffer Belinda to follow her into the boundoir . 
-- All these things Belinda recollected in the space of a few seconds , as she stood contemplating Marriott and the dresses . 
Lady Delacour was discontented with her tragic attire , and she grew still more out of humour with herself , when she saw Belinda . 
`` I protest Marriot has made a perfect fright of me , '' said her ladyship , as she got into her carriage , `` and I 'm positive my dress would become you a million of times better than your own . '' 
Miss Portman regretted that it was too late to change . 
As soon as they got to lady Singleton 's , lady Delacour and miss Portman immediately went up stairs to exchange dresses . 
Poor Belinda , now that she felt herself in spirits to undertake the comic muse , was rather vexed to be obliged to give up her becoming character ; but there was no resisting the polite energy of lady Delacour 's vanity . 
In a few minutes she half opened the door , threw out her tragic robes , and cried , `` Here , miss Portman , give me yours -- quick -- and let 's see whether comedy or tragedy will be ready first . '' 
At this went off admirably well with every body but miss Portman ; she could not help thinking it extraordinary , that a person who was obviously fond of being waited upon , would never suffer any person to assist her at her toilette except Marriott , a woman of whom she was evidently afraid . 
Lady Delacour 's quick eye saw curiosity painted in Belinda 's countenance , and for a moment she was embarrassed ; but she soon recovered herself , and endeavoured to turn the course of miss Portman 's thoughts , by whispering to her some nonsense about Clarence Hervey -- A cabalistical name , which she knew had the power , when pronounced in a certain tone , of throwing Belinda into confusion . 
He was obliged to give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade , but he resolved to be at lady Singleton 's , that he might meet lady Delacour and miss Portman . 
He thought that he could not flatter her ladyship more than by abusing miss Portman . 
said Belinda , in a feigned voice -- `` What miseries spring from these ill-suited marriages ! 
Belinda made an effort to change her seat , but she was encompassed so , that she could not retreat . 
As for this Belinda Portman , 't was a good hit to send her to lady Delacour 's ; but I take it , she hangs upon hands ; for last winter , when I was at Bath , she was hawked about every where , and the aunt was puffing her with might and main . 
You heard of nothing , wherever you went , but of Belinda Portman , and Belinda Portman 's accomplishments -- Belinda Portman , and her accomplishments , I 'll swear , were as well advertised , as Packwood 's razor strops . '' 
-- Belinda Portman 's a good pretty girl , but what then ? 
Do you think I do n't see as plainly as any of you , that Belinda Portman 's a composition of art and affectation ? '' 
`` Hush -- not so loud , Clarence ; here she comes , '' said his companion . 
`` The comic muse , is not she ? '' 
pursued lady Delacour -- `` I am not very well , '' whispered miss Portman to her ladyship -- `` could we get away ? '' 
replied her ladyship , in a whisper -- 't is not easy , but we 'll try what can be done , if it is necessary . '' 
-- Belinda had no power to reply to this raillery , indeed she scarcely heard the words that were said to her ; but she put her arm within lady Delacour 's , who , to her great relief , had the good nature to leave the room with her immediately . 
`` Nothing , if I could have air , '' said Belinda . 
`` I 'm perfectly well , now -- perfectly well , '' said Belinda . 
When lady Delacour pulled off Belinda 's mask , her face was , during the first instant , pale ; the next moment , crimsoned over with a burning blush . 
-- Will you give miss Portman a glass of water ? 
-- There 's sal-volatile for you , child , '' continued she to Belinda . 
`` It is perfectly indifferent to me , madam , '' Belinda said , with a voice and look of proud indignation . 
`` Why Clarence , the casting of your sepent 's skin seems to have quite changed your nature -- nothing but the simplicity of the dove left ; and I expect to hear you cooing presently -- do n't you , miss Portman ? '' 
-- Why these tears , Belinda ? 
O , '' cried Belinda , `` never , never more will I take such advice -- never more will I expose myself to be insulted as a female adventurer -- Little did I know in what a light I appeared -- Little did I know what gentlemen thought of my aunt Stanhope -- of my cousins -- of myself . '' 
Miss Portman , not without some reluctance , repeated the conversation which she had heard -- `` And is this all ? '' 
-- No , I have not one real friend in the world , except Harriot Freke -- yet , you see , I am the comic muse , and mean to keep it up -- keep it up to the last -- on purpose to provoke those , who would give their eyes to be able to pity me -- I humbly thank them , no pity for lady Delacour -- Follow my example , Belinda ; elbow your way through the crowd ; if you stop to be civil and beg pardon , and ` hope I did n't hurt ye , ' you will be trod under foot . 
To Belinda the night appeared long and dull ; the common place wit of chimney-sweepers and gipsies ; the antics of harlequins ; the graces of flower girls and Cleopatras , had not power to amuse her ; for her thoughts still recurred to that conversation , which had given her so much pain -- pain which lady Delacour 's raillery had failed to obliterate . 
-- It was broad day-light , and Belinda had a full view of her countenance , which was the picture of despair -- She uttered not one syllable more , nor had miss Portman the courage to interrupt her meditations , till they came within sight of lady Singleton 's ; when Belinda ventured to remind her , that she had resolved to stop there , and change dresses , before Marriott saw them . 
Belinda 's astonishment at these words , and at the solemn manner in which they were pronounced , was inexpressible ; she gazed at lady Delacour , and then repeated the word -- `` dying ! '' 
`` But you seem to me , and to all the world , in perfect health ; and but half an hour ago in perfect spirits , '' said Belinda . 
`` I seem to you , and to all the world , what I am not -- I tell you I am dying , '' said her ladyship , in an emphatic tone . 
Lady Delacour hurried up stairs , bidding Belinda follow her , to her dressing-room . 
Marriott was lighting the six wax candles on the dressing-table -- `` As I live , they have changed dresses after all , '' said Marriott to herself , as she fixed her eyes upon lady Delacour and miss Portman . 
`` Marriott , you need not wait ; I 'll ring when I want you , '' said lady Delacour , and taking one of the candles from the table , she passed on hastily with miss Portman , through her dressing-room , through her bedchamber , and to the door of the mysterious cabinet . 
`` Marriott , the key of this door , '' cried she , impatiently , after she had , in vain , attempted to open it . 
`` I 'll ring when you are wanted , Marriott , '' said lady Delacour ; and pushing open the door with violence , she rushed forward to the middle of the room , and turning back , she beckoned to Belinda to follow her -- `` Come in , what is it you are afraid of ? '' 
said she . 
-- Belinda went on , and the moment she was in the room , lady Delacour shut and locked the door . 
-- Belinda , as she looked round , saw nothing but a confusion of linen rags -- vials , some empty , some full -- and she perceived that there was a strong smell of medicines . 
-- She then , with a species of fury , wiped the paint from her face , and returning to Belinda , held the candle so as to throw the light full upon her livid features . 
-- Her eyes were sunk , her cheeks hollow -- no trace of youth or beauty remained on her death-like countenance , which formed a horrid contrast with her gay fantastic dress . 
`` You are shocked , Belinda , '' said she , `` but as yet you have seen nothing -- look here , '' -- and baring one half of her bosom , she revealed a hideous spectacle . 
Belinda sunk back into a chair -- lady Delacour flung herself on her knees before her . 
-- She paused -- Belinda had no power to speak . 
`` Promise , swear to me , '' resumed lady Delacour vehemently , seizing Belinda 's hand , `` that you will never reveal to any mortal what you have seen and heard this night . 
Lady Delacour hid her face on Belinda 's lap , and almost stifled by the violence of contending emotions , she at last gave vent to them , and sobbed aloud . 
`` Trust to one , '' said Belinda , pressing her hand with all the tenderness which humanity could dictate , `` who will never leave you at the mercy of an insolent waiting woman -- trust to me . '' 
`` Trust to you , '' said lady Delacour , looking up eagerly in Belinda 's face ; `` yes -- I think -- I may trust to you -- for though a niece of Mrs. Stanhope 's , I have seen this day , and have seen with surprise , symptoms of artless feeling about you . 
-- `` Put me to bed , Marriott , '' said lady Delacour , with a subdued voice -- `` but first light miss Portman to her room -- she need not -- yet -- see the horrid business of my toilette : '' Belinda , when she was left alone , immediately opened her shutters , and threw up the sash to refresh herself with the morning air . 
She felt excessively fatigued , and in the hurry of her mind , she could not think of any thing distinctly . 
She took off her masquerade dress , and went to bed , in hopes of forgetting , for a few hours , what she felt indelibly impressed upon her imagination . 
But it was in vain that she endeavoured to compose herself to sleep ; her ideas were in too great and painful confusion . 
For some time , whenever she closed her eyes , the face and form of lady Delacour , such as she had just beheld them , seemed to haunt her ; afterward , the idea of Clarence Hervey , and the painful recollection of the conversation she had overheard , recurred to her ; the words , `` do you think I do n't know that Belinda Portman is a composition of artifice and affectation , '' were fixed in her memory . 
Belinda 's mind , however , was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect : she seemed only to live over again the preceding night . 
At last the strange motley figures which she had seen at the masquerade flitted before her eyes , and she sunk into an uneasy slumber . 
Miss Portman was awakened by the ringing of lady Delacour 's bedchamber bell . 
She opened her eyes with the confused idea that something disagreeable had happened ; and before she had distinctly recollected herself , Marriott came to her bedside , with a note from lady Delacour -- If was written with a pencil . 
`` Let me see you in my dressing-room , dear Belinda , as soon as you have adored ` With head uncover 'd , the cosmetic powers . ' 
-- There certainly were such people as Amazons -- I hope you admire them -- for who could live without the admiration of Belinda Portman ! 
Belinda obeyed the summons to her ladyship 's dressing-room : she found lady Delacour with her face completely repaired with paint , and her spirits with opium . 
Mrs. Franks must let us see her again to-morrow , to take into consideration your court dress , my dear Belinda -- `` miss Portman presented by lady Delacour '' -- Mrs. Franks , let her dress , for Heaven 's sake , be something that will make a fine paragraph -- I give you four and twenty hours to think of it . 
After dinner , lady Delacour , having made Belinda protest and blush , and blush and protest , that her head was not running upon the twisted note , began the history of her life and opinions in the following manner : `` I do nothing by halves , my dear -- I shall not tell you my adventures , as Gil Blas told his to the archbishop of Grenada -- skipping over the useful passages -- because you are not an archbishop , and I should not have the grace to put on a sanctified face , if you were . 
You are surprized that I can laugh and jest about such a melancholy thing as my marriage with lord Delacour ; and so am I , especially when I recollect all the circumstances -- for though I bragged of there being no love in my history , there was when I was a goose or a gosling of about eighteen -- just your age , Belinda , I think -- something very like love playing about my heart , or my head -- There was a certain Henry Percival , a Clarence Hervey of a man -- no , he had ten times the sense , begging your pardon , of Clarence Hervey -- his misfortune , or mine , was that he had too much sense -- he was in love with me but not with my faults ; now I , wisely considering , that my faults were the greatest part of me , insisted upon his being in love with my faults . 
`` But my dear , Belinda , however we might pay one another , we could not pay all the world with words . 
You wonder to hear me speak in this manner , Belinda , but one must speak the truth sometimes ; and this is what I have been saying to Harriot Freke continually -- continually , for these ten years past . 
my dear Belinda , '' said lady Delacour , pausing ; `` I little foresaw where or how it was to end : but I am not come yet to the tragical part of my story , and as long as I can laugh , I will . 
-- Miss Portman , have the goodness to ring , for I must have something immediately . '' 
-- Belinda was terrified at the wildness of her manner . 
-- Then she ordered coffee , and afterward chasse-cafè , and at last , turning to Belinda with a forced smile , she said -- `` Now shall the princess Scheherazade go on with her story ? '' 
-- My dear Belinda , if you will not quarrel with the quality , you may have what quantity of praise you please . 
interrupted Belinda . 
-- My dear Belinda , how I envy you ! 
-- Pray , when you write , repeat the same thing to her , and tell her , that since she has introduced Belinda Portman to me , I am a hundred times more obliged to her than ever I was before . 
-- The words , of her age , piqued me , and I spared no pains to make him forget them -- a stupid man can not readily be persuaded out of his senses -- what he sees , he sees , and neither more nor less -- but 't is the easiest thing in the world to catch hold of a man of genius -- you have nothing to do but to appeal from his senses to his imagination ; and then he sees with the eyes of his imagination , and hears with the ears of his imagination ; and then no matter what the age , beauty , or wit of the charmer may be -- no matter whether it be lady Delacour , or Belinda Portman -- I think I know Clarence Hervey 's character au fin fond , and I could lead him where I pleased -- but do n't be alarmed , my dear , you know I ca n't lead him into matrimony . 
-- But I will spare you , Belinda -- I promised that you should not have a scene , and I will keep my word -- It is , however , a great relief to open my mind to one who has some feeling -- Harriot Freke has none -- I am convinced that she has no more feeling than this table . 
-- I have not yet told you how she has used me . 
-- You know that it was she who led , or rather dragged me into that scrape with Lawless -- For that I never reproached her . 
-- You know it was she who frightened me into fighting that duel with Mrs. Luttridge -- For this I never reproached her . 
-- You are but just come into the world , Belinda -- the world of wickedness I mean , my dear , or you would have heard what a piece of work there was , a few years ago , about Harriot Freke , and this cousin of hers . 
-- Without betraying her confidence , I may just tell you what is known to every body , that she went so far , that if it had not been for me , not a soul would have visited her -- she swam in the sea of folly out of her depth -- the tide of fashion ebbed , and then was she left sticking knee deep in the mud ; a ridiculous , scandalous figure ; I had the courage and foolish good nature to hazard myself for her , and actually dragged her to terra firma -- how she has gone on since I can not tell you -- precisely , because I am in the secret -- but the catastrophe is public -- to make her peace with her husband , she gives up her friend . 
that I could have pardoned , if she had not been so base as to go over to Mrs. Luttridge . 
Then she retired to her boudoir , saying , with an air of levity , to Belinda , as she left the room -- `` Good bye , my dear Belinda ; I leave you to ruminate sweet and bitter thoughts -- to think of the last speech and confession of lady Delacour , or , what will interest you much more , the first speech and confession of -- Clarence Hervey . '' 
Lady Delacour 's history , and the manner in which it was related , excited in Belinda 's mind astonishment -- pity -- admiration -- and contempt . 
-- Astonishment at her inconsistency -- pity for her misfortunes -- admiration of her talents -- and contempt for her conduct . 
-- To these emotions succeeded the recollection of the promise which she had made , not to leave her in her last illness , at the mercy of an insolent attendant . 
This promise Belinda thought of with terrour -- she dreaded the sight of sufferings , which she knew must end in death -- she dreaded the sight of that affected gayety , and of that real levity , which so ill became the condition of a dying woman . 
It was obvious , that some of lady Delacour 's history must have been known to Mrs. Stanhope ; and Belinda , the more she reflected , the more she was surprised at her aunt 's having chosen such a chaperon for a young woman just entering into the world . 
-- Belinda saw things in a new light ; and for the first time in her life she reasoned for herself upon what she saw and felt . 
-- At a distance , lady Delacour had appeared to miss Portman the happiest person in the world ; upon a nearer view , she discovered that her ladyship was one of the most miserable of human beings . 
-- To have married her niece to such a man as lord Delacour , Mrs. Stanhope would have thought the most fortunate thing imaginable ; but it was now obvious to Belinda , that neither the title of viscountess , nor the pleasure of spending three fortunes , could ensure felicity . 
-- `` If lady Delacour , with all the advantages of wealth , rank , wit and beauty , has not been able to make herself happy in this life of fashionable dissipation , '' said Belinda to herself , `` why should I follow the same course , and expect to be more fortunate ? '' 
-- The result of Belinda 's reflections upon lady Delacour 's history was a resolution to profit by her bad example ; but this resolution it was more easy to form than to keep . 
-- It was Belinda 's intention , in pursuance of her new plans of life , to spend , whilst she remained in London , as little money as possible upon superfluities and dress . 
-- She had , at her own disposal , only 100l . 
per annum , the interest of her fortune ; but beside this , her aunt , who was desirous that she should go to court , and make a splendid figure there , had sent her a draught on her banker for two hundred guineas . 
`` You will , I trust , '' said her aunt , at the conclusion of her letter , `` repay me when you are established in the world , as I hope and believe , from what I hear from lady Delacour of the power of your charms , you will soon be , to the entire satisfaction of all your friends . 
Belinda resolved neither to go to court , nor to touch her aunt 's two hundred guineas ; and she wrote a long letter to her , in which she explained her feelings and views at large . 
In this letter she meant to have returned Mrs Stanhope 's draught , but her feelings and views changed between the writing of this epistle , and the going out of the post . 
-- Mrs. Franks , the milliner , came in the interim , and brought home lady Delacour 's beautiful dress ; it was not the sight of this , however , which changed Belinda 's mind , but she could not resist lady Delacour 's raillery . 
`` Why , my dear , '' said her ladyship , after having listened to all miss Portman could say about her love of independence , and the necessity of economy to preserve that independence -- `` all this is prodigiously fine -- but shall I translate it into plain English -- You were mortally wounded the other night by some random reflections of a set of foolish young men -- Clarence Hervey amongst the number -- and instead of punishing them , you sagely and generously determined to punish yourself . 
Like a reasonable creature , miss Portman followed lady Delacour , and bespoke , or rather let her ladyship bespeak for her , fifty guineas worth of elegance and fashion . 
Mrs. Franks departed , and Belinda sighed . 
The moment her ladyship mentioned the masquerade , the conversation which had passed at lady Singleton 's , came full into Clarence Hervey 's recollection , and his embarrassment was evident -- not indeed to Belinda , who had turned away to look over some new music that lay upon a stand at the farthest end of the room , and she found this such a wonderfully interesting occupation , that she did not for some minutes hear , or appear to hear , one word of the conversation which was going on between Mr. Hervey and lady Delacour . 
-- At last her ladyship tapped her upon the shoulder , saying in a playful tone -- `` miss Portman , I arrest your attention at the suit of Clarence Hervey -- this gentleman is passionately fond of music -- to my curse -- for he never sees my harp , but he worries me with reproaches for having left off playing upon it . 
-- I assure you Clarence , that Belinda touches a harp divinely -- she would absolutely charm . '' 
-- `` Your ladyship should not waste such valuable praise , '' interrupted Belinda . 
-- `` Do you forget , that Belinda Portman and her accomplishments have already been as well advertised as Packwood 's razor strops ? '' 
The manner in which these words were pronounced , made a great impression upon Clarence Hervey , and he began to believe it was possible , that a niece of the match-making Mrs. Stanhope might not be `` a compound of art and affectation '' -- `` Though her aunt has advertised her , '' said he to himself , `` she seems to have too much dignity to advertise herself , and it would be very unjust to blame her for the faults of another person . 
-- I will see more of her . '' 
Some morning visitors were announced , who for the time suspended Clarence Hervey 's reflexions ; the effect of them , however , immediately appeared , for as his good opinion of Belinda increased , his ambition to please her was strongly excited . 
He was mortified notwithstanding , for he distinctly perceived , that whilst Belinda joined with ease and dignity in the general conversation , her manner towards him was grave and reserved . 
-- The next morning he called earlier than usual , but though lady Delacour was always at home to him , she was then unluckily dressing to go to court ; he inquired whether miss Portman would accompany her ladyship , and he learnt from his friend Marriott , that she was not to be presented this day , because Mrs. Franks had not brought home her dress . 
-- Mr. Hervey called again two hours afterwards -- lady Delacour was gone to court -- He asked for miss Portman -- `` Not at home '' -- was the mortifying answer , though as he had passed by the windows , he had heard the delightful sound of her harp . 
-- The queen is soon to give a charming breakfast at Frogmore , and I am paying my court with all my might , in hopes of being asked , for Belinda must see one of their galas before we leave town , that I 'm determined upon . 
-- But where is she ? '' 
Encouraged by Clarence Hervey 's laughter , lady Delacour went on to mimic what she called the hoop awkwardnesses of all her acquaintance , and if these could have failed to divert Belinda , it was impossible , for her to be serious , when she heard Clarence Hervey declare , that he was convinced he could manage a hoop as well as any woman in England , except lady Delacour . 
`` I have sometimes fancied -- but I believe it is onlymy fancy , '' said lady Delacour , `` that this young lady , '' turning to Belinda , `` is not unlike your madame de Grignan -- I have seen a picture of her at Strawberry-hill . '' 
-- `` But here , without flattery to the living , as you have a lock of madame de Grignan 's hair , you can tell us whether la belle chevelure , of which madame de Sevigné talked so much , was any thing to be compared to my Belinda 's . '' 
-- As she spoke , lady Delacour , before Belinda was aware of her intentions , dextrously let down her beautiful tresses -- and the countess de Pomenars was so much struck at the sight , that she was incapable of paying the necessary compliments -- `` Nay , touch it , '' said lady Delacour -- `` it is so fine and so soft . '' 
-- `` I declare he deserves a lock of la belle chevelure for that speech , miss Portman , '' cried lady Delacour , `` I 'll appeal to all the world -- madame de Pomenars must have a lock to measure with madame de Grignan 's ? 
-- Come , a second rape of the lock , Belinda . '' 
Fortunately for Belinda , `` the glittering forfex '' was not immediately produced , as fine ladies do not now , as in former times , carry any such useless implements about with them . 
-- Such was the modest , graceful dignity of miss Portman 's manners , that she escaped without even the charge of prudery -- She retired to her own apartment as soon as she could . 
`` She passes on m ` imblenched majesty '' -- said lady Delacour . 
`` She is really a charming woman , '' said Clarence Hervey , in a low voice , to lady Delacour , drawing her into a recessed window ; he in the same low voice continued -- `` Could I obtain a private audience of a few minutes when your ladyship is at leisure ? 
-- `` Have not I given you time to compose a charming speech , '' said lady Delacour as she entered the room -- `` but make it as short as you can , unless you wish that miss Portman should hear it , for she will be down stairs in three minutes . '' 
`` In one word then , my dear lady Delacour , can you , and will you , make my peace with miss Portman -- I am much concerned about that foolish razor-strop dialogue , which she overheard at lady Singleton 's . '' 
-- `` You are concerned that she overheard it -- no doubt . '' 
`` No '' , said Clarence Hervey , `` I am rejoiced that she overheard it , since it has been the means of convincing me of my mistake ; but I am concerned that I had the presumption and injustice to judge of miss Portman so hastily . 
-- I am convinced , that though she is a niece of Mrs. Stanhope 's , she has dignity of mind , and simplicity of character . 
May not I say at once , ` my dear Belinda , Clarence Hervey desires me to tell you , that he is convinced you are an angel ? ' 
`` But , '' said Mr. Hervey , `` perhaps miss Portman has heard the song of -- ` What know we of angels , I meant it in joke . ' 
-- `` Is this part of my message to miss Portman , '' said lady Delacour ? 
In speaking of miss Portman , I simply expressed esteem and ad -- O , no and -- '' `` No additions , '' said lady Delacour , `` content yourself with esteem -- simply -- and miss Portman is safe , and you too -- I presume . 
of miss Portman agree with your admiration of lady Delacour . '' 
-- `` You will make my peace , you promise me , with miss Portman , '' cried Clarence , eagerly . 
`` Yes , I will make your peace , and you shall see Belinda smile upon you once more , upon condition , '' continued lady Delacour , speaking very quickly , as if she was hurried by the sound of people coming up stairs -- `` but we '' ll talk of that another time . '' 
`` Upon condition that you do a little job for me -- indeed for Belinda . 
-- She is to go with me to the birthnight -- and she has often hinted to me , that our horses are shockingly shabby for people of our condition . 
-- I know she wishes , that upon such an occasion -- her first appearance at court , you know -- we should go in style . 
-- Now my dear positive lord has said , he will not let us have a pair of the handsomest horses I ever saw , which are at Tattersal 's , and on which Belinda , I know , has secretly set her heart , as I have openly in vain . '' 
`` Your ladyship and miss Portman can not possibly set your hearts on any thing in vain -- especially on any thing that it is in the power of Clarence Hervey to procure . 
With much address she had satisfied herself as to his views , with respect to Belinda . 
She was convinced that he had no immediate thoughts of matrimony ; but that if he were condemned to marry , miss Portman would be his wife . 
-- As this did not interfere with her plans , lady Delacour was content . 
When lady Delacour repeated to miss Portman the message about `` simplicity of mind , and dignity of character , '' she frankly said -- `` Belinda , notwithstanding all this , observe , I 'm determined to retain Clarence Hervey among the number of my public worshippers during my life -- which you know can not last long . 
There was one part of the conversation between Mr. Hervey and her ladyship , which she , in her great discretion , did not immediately repeat to miss Portman -- that part which related to the horses . 
-- In this transaction Belinda had no farther share , than having once , when her ladyship had the handsome horses brought for her to look at , assented to the opinion , that they were the handsomest horses she ever beheld . 
-- Mr. Hervey , however gallantly he replied to her ladyship , was secretly vexed to find that Belinda had so little delicacy , as to permit her name to be employed in such a manner . 
-- He sent home the horses to lady Delacour , the next day , and addressed Belinda , when he met her , with the air of a man of gallantry , who thought that his peace had been cheaply made . 
-- `` Is not smiling , '' said he , `` the epithet always applied to peace -- yet I have not been able to obtain one smile from miss Portman since I have been promised peace . '' 
-- Embarrassed by Mr. Hervey 's reproaches , and provoked to find that Belinda was proof against all her raillery , lady Delacour grew quite ill-humoured towards her . 
Belinda , unconscious of having given any just cause of offence , was unmoved ; and her ladyship 's embarrassment increased . 
-- At last , resuming all her former appearance of friendship and confidence , she suddenly exclaimed , one night after she had flattered Belinda into high spirits -- `` Do you know , my dear , that I have been so ashamed of myself for this week past , that I have hardly dared to look you in the face . 
It was not difficult to obtain Belinda 's forgiveness . 
Belinda was too much vexed at this instant to understand raillery . 
-- She was inspired by anger with unwonted courage , and losing all fear of lady Delacour 's wit , she very seriously expostulated with her ladyship upon having thus used her name , without her consent or knowledge . 
Belinda felt she was now in danger of being led into a situation , which might be fatal to her reputation and her happiness ; and she was the more surprised at her ladyship , when she recollected the history she had so lately heard of Harriot Freke and colonel Lawless . 
`` You can not but be sensible , lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , `` that after the contempt I have heard Mr. Hervey express for match-making Mrs. Stanhope 's nieces , I should degrade myself by any attempts to attract his attention . 
-- Belinda smiled -- `` There now , one such smile as that for Clarence Hervey , and I am out of debt and danger , '' said lady Delacour . 
said Belinda -- `` You know that I ought not to be persuaded to do what I am conscious is wrong . 
`` I can pay for them , '' exclaimed Belinda , `` and will with the greatest pleasure . 
-- If you say a you must say b. '' `` Then , '' said Belinda , `` I will not go to the drawing-room . '' 
`` Surely , '' said miss Portman , `` it is better for me to throw away fifty guineas , poor as I am , than to hazard the happiness of my life . 
-- Well , then it shall not be forced to say the a , b , c , of Cupid 's alphabet , to that terrible pedagogue Clarence Hervey , till it pleases -- but seriously , miss Portman , I 'm concerned that you will make me take this draft . 
-- Next month I shall have it in my power , my dear , to repay you with a thousand thanks -- and in a few months more we shall have another birthday , and a new star shall appear in the firmament of fashion , and it shall be called Belinda . 
Mrs. Franks at first declared , that it would be an impossibility to dispose of miss Portman 's dress , though she would do any thing upon earth to oblige lady Delacour -- however , ten guineas made every thing possible . 
Belinda rejoiced , at having , as she thought , extricated herself at so cheap a rate ; and well pleased with her own conduct , she wrote to her aunt Stanhope , to inform her of as much of the transaction as she could disclose , without betraying lady Delacour . 
The tenour of miss Portman 's letter will be sufficiently apparent from Mrs. Stanhope 's answer . 
`` I can not but feel some astonishment , Belinda , at your very extraordinary conduct , and more extraordinary letter . 
-- You do not want sense , Belinda -- you perfectly understand me -- and consequently , your errours I must impute to the defect of your heart , and not of your judgment . 
Belinda , though she could not , consistently with what she thought right , follow the advice so artfully given to her in this epistle , was yet extremely concerned to find , that she had incurred the displeasure of an aunt to whom she thought herself under obligations . 
She resolved to lay by as much as she possibly could , from the interest of her fortune , and to repay the two hundred guineas to Mrs. Stanhope : she was conscious that she had no right to lend this money to lady Delacour , if her aunt had expressly desired that she should spend it only on her court dress ; but this had not distinctly been expressed , when Mrs. Stanhope sent her niece the draughts . 
-- Beside the concern she felt from the thoughts of having displeased her aunt , Belinda was both vexed and mortified , to perceive that in Clarence Hervey 's manner towards her there was not the change , which she had expected that her conduct would naturally produce . 
One day she was surprised by his reproaching her for caprice in having given up her intentions of going to court . 
Lady Delacour 's embarrassment whilst Mr. Hervey spoke , Belinda atributed to her ladyship 's desire that Clarence should not know , that she had been obliged to borrow the money to pay him for the horses . 
Belinda thought that this was a species of mean pride ; but she made it a point to keep her ladyship 's secret : she therefore slightly answered Mr. Hervey , `` that she wondered that a man , who is so well acquainted with the female sex , should be surprised at any instance of caprice from a woman . '' 
-- The conversation then took another turn , and whilst they were talking on indifferent subjects , in came lord Delacour 's man , Champfort , with Mrs. Stanhope 's draught for two hundred guineas , which the coach-maker 's man had just brought back , because miss Portman had forgotten to endorse it . 
-- Belinda 's astonishment was almost as great at this instant , as lady Delacour 's confusion . 
-- `` Come this way , my dear , and we 'll find you a pen and ink -- you need not wait , Champfort -- but tell the man to wait for the draught -- miss Portman will endorse it immediately . '' 
-- And she took Belinda into another room . 
exclaimed Belinda . 
said Belinda . 
-- `` Lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , in a firmer tone than she had ever before spoken -- `` I must insist upon this draught 's being given to Mr. Hervey . '' 
-- You can not object to that , for you are not the keeper of my conscience -- I will tell Clarence the whole business , and do you honour due , my dear -- so endorse the note , whilst I go and sound both the praises of your dignity of mind , and simplicity of character , & c. & c. & c. & c. & c. '' -- And her ladyship broke away from Belinda , returned to Clarence Hervey , and told the whole affair with that peculiar grace with which she knew how to make a good story of a bad one . 
-- Clarence was as favourable an auditor at this time as she could possibly have found , for no human being could value money less than he did , and all sense of her ladyship 's meanness was lost in his joy at discovering that Belinda was worthy of his esteem . 
-- Now he felt in its fullest extent all the power she had over his heart , and he was upon the point of declaring his attachment to her , when -- '' malheureusement , '' -- sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort announced themselves by the noise they made on the staircase . 
Clarence Hervey made no answer , for he was at that instant recollecting how Belinda looked in the character of the tragic muse . 
-- Belinda Portman do you mean ? '' 
`` Indeed , '' said lady Anne , `` miss Portman is in a dangerous situation -- but some young people learn prudence by being placed in dangerous situations , as some young horses , as I have heard Mr. Percival say , learn to be sure footed , by being left to pick their own way on bad roads . '' 
-- Clarence Hervey endeavoured to take his share in it with his usual vivacity , but he was thinking of Belinda Portman , dangerous situations , stumbling horses , & c. and he made several blunders , which showed his absence of mind . 
-- But , my dear doctor , I hope you will not be prejudiced against Belinda , merely because she is with lady Delacour ; for , to my certain knowledge , she is not under her ladyship 's influence . 
`` Very possibly , '' interrupted Dr. X -- , `` but before we go any farther , will you please to tell me of what Belinda you are talking ? '' 
`` Belinda Portman . 
`` Miss Portman , a niece of Mrs. Stanhope 's ? '' 
-- Belinda was particularly pleased with his manners and conversation ; she saw that he paid her much attention , and she was desirous that he should think favourably of her ; but she had the good sense and good taste to avoid a display of her abilities and accomplishments . 
`` Her ladyship is certainly very brilliant , '' said Clarence , `` but I hope that miss Portman did not overpower you . '' 
`` No -- I turned my eyes from lady Delacour upon miss Portman , as a painter turns his eyes upon mild green , to rest them , when they have been dazzled by glaring colours . 
` She yields her charms of mind with sweet delay . ' 
`` I was afraid , '' said Hervey , `` that you might think her manners too reserved and cold -- they are certainly become more so than they used to be . 
-- I am afraid you do not approve of Belinda . '' 
-- I must see your Belinda act -- I must study her , before I can give you my final judgment . 
-- For your sake , my dear Hervey , I shall obey her ladyship most punctually , that I may have frequent opportunities of seeing your miss Portman . '' 
-- Belinda , who had been entertained by Dr. X -- 's conversation during this first visit , was more and more delighted with his company , as she became more acquainted with his understanding and character . 
She felt that he unfolded her powers , and that with the greatest politeness and address he raised her confidence in herself , without ever descending to flattery . 
-- By degrees , she learned to look upon him as her friend ; she imparted to him with great ingenuousness her opinions on various subjects , and she was both amused and instructed by his observations on the characters and manners of the company , who frequented lady Delacour 's assemblies . 
The ladies admired his taste as a poet , the gentlemen his accuracy as a critic ; lady Delacour loudly applauded , and Belinda silently approved . 
-- Clarence made an errour in his first move , for his attention was distracted by seeing Belinda behind his adversary 's chair . 
-- The Spaniard was deceived by this mistake into a contemptuous opinion of his opponent -- Belinda changed her place -- Clarence recovered his presence of mind , and convinced him that he was not a man to be despised . 
-- Clarence Hervey was first recalled to himself by the deep blush which he saw on Belinda 's cheek , when queen Elizabeth addressed her as one of her maids of honour , of whom she affected to be jealous . 
The company followed her -- Clarence Hervey remained with Dr. X -- and Belinda , who had just asked the doctor to teach her the moves at chess . 
The vivacity of youth and of health , miss Portman , always charms me ; but this gayety of lady Delacour 's does not appear to me that of a sound mind in a sound body . '' 
The doctor 's penetration went so near the truth , that Belinda , afraid of betraying her friend 's secret , never raised her eyes from the chess-board whilst he spoke , but went on setting up the fallen castles , and bishops , and kings , with expeditious diligence . 
said Belinda . 
`` O , no , '' said Belinda , `` they are intent upon themselves . '' 
Belinda was touched by the candour and good sense with which Clarence Hervey spoke . 
-- His character appeared in a new light -- she was proud of her own judgment , in having discerned his merit , and for a moment she permitted herself to feel `` unreproved pleasure in his company . '' 
The next morning , sir Philip Baddely and Mr. Rochfort called at lady Delacour 's -- Mr. Hervey was present -- Her ladyship was summoned to Mrs. Franks , and Belinda was left with these gentlemen . 
-- Miss Portman , do n't you admire Hervey 's taste ? '' 
`` In this instance I certainly do admire Mr. Hervey 's taste , '' said Belinda , `` for the best of all possible reasons , because it entirely agrees with my own . '' 
Dr. X -- shall be miss Portman 's pet quiz . 
Belinda , without being in the least discomposed by their insolent folly , as soon as they had finished laughing , very coolly observed , that she could have no objection to give her reasons for preferring Dr. X -- 's company , but for fear they might give offence to sir Philip and his friends . 
She then defended the doctor with so much firmness , and yet with so much propriety , that Clarence Hervey was absolutely enchanted with her , and with his own penetration in having discovered her real character , notwithstanding she was Mrs. Stanhope 's niece . 
As they left the room , Clarence Hervey involuntarily turned to Belinda , and he thought that he read in her ingenuous , animated countenance , full approbation of his conduct . 
-- Belinda , my dear , will you have the charity to look over some of these letters for me , which , as Marriott tells me , have been lying in my writing table this week -- expecting most unreasonably , that I should have the grace to open them . 
`` What have you there , miss Portman ? '' 
said lady Delacour , taking from Belinda 's hand one of the letters which she had begged her to look over -- `` Something wondrous pathetic , I should guess , by your countenance . 
`` Let me prevail upon your ladyship to make an exception to the general rule then , '' said Belinda , `` I can assure you this is not a common school-girl 's letter ; miss Delacour seems to inherit her mother 's ` éloquence de billet . '' 
`` Miss Portman seems to possess , by inheritance , by instinct , by magic , or otherwise , powers of persuasion , which no one can resist . 
-- Really 't is vastly well , '' continued her ladyship , as she read the letter -- `` where did the little gipsy learn to write so charmingly -- I protest I should like of all things to have her at home with me this summer -- the 21st of June -- well , after the birthday , I shall have time to think about it , -- But then , we shall be going out of town , and at Harrowgate I should not know what to do with her -- she had better , much better go to her humdrum aunt Margaret 's , as she always does -- she is a fixture in Grosvenor square -- these stationary good people -- these zoophite friends are sometimes very convenient -- and Mrs. Margaret Delacour is the most unexceptionable zoophite in the creation . 
repeated Clarence Hervey , in a tone which surprised her ladyship . 
She looked immediately with a significant smile at Belinda . 
-- `` Why do not you echo evils , miss Portman ? '' 
`` Well , my dear , are you still poring over that letter of Helena 's , '' said lady Delacour to miss Portman . 
`` I fancy your ladyship did not quite finish it , '' said Belinda . 
`` Why will you delight in making yourself appear worse than you are , my dear lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , taking her hand . 
`` Surely your ladyship does not think , '' said Belinda , `` that a wife is a being whose actions are necessarily governed by a husband . '' 
Belinda was surprised , and shocked at the malignant vehemence with which her ladyship uttered those words ; it was in vain , however , that she remonstrated on the injustice of predetermining to detest lady Anne ; merely because she had shown kindness to Helena , and because she bore a high character . 
Upon this occasion , her wit had not it 's usual effect upon miss Portman ; instead of entertaining , it disgusted her . 
Pity succeeded to disgust and displeasure in Belinda 's mind , and she could hardly refrain from tears , whilst she saw this unhappy creature , with forced smiles , endeavour to hide the real anguish of her soul -- she could only say -- `` But , my dear lady Delacour , do not you think that your little Helena , who seems to have a most affectionate disposition , would add to your happiness at home ? '' 
Belinda felt a hot tear drop upon her hand , which lay upon lady Delacour 's lap . 
-- Write , '' said lady Delacour , turning hastily to Belinda , `` write in my name , and tell her to go Oakly-park , and to be happy . '' 
said Belinda . 
Pride , anger , and sorrow , struggled in her countenance as she spoke . 
-- She turned her face from Belinda , and walked out of the room with dignity . 
Nothing remains for me to do , thought Belinda , but to sooth this haughty spirit -- all other hope I see is vain . 
-- Clarence Hervey was a thoroughly generous young man : capable of making the greatest sacrifices , when encouraged by the hope of doing good , he determined to postpone the declaration of his attachment to Belinda , that he might devote himself entirely to his new project . 
Lady Delacour was immediately ambitious to outshine her in equipage ; and it was this paltry ambition , that made her condescend to all the meanness of the transaction , by which she obtained miss Portman 's draught , and Clarence Hervey 's two hundred guineas . 
`` O , my dearest Belinda , '' said she , as she left her dressing-room , how terrible a thing it is , that you can not go with me ! 
-- ` Twould be too much to see in one night Mrs Luttridge 's mortification , and my Belinda 's triumph . 
Belinda , after her ladyship 's departure , retired to the library . 
-- Her time passed so agreeably during lady Delacour 's absence , that she was surprised when she heard the clock strike twelve . 
The idea of Clarence Hervey was so intimately connected with that of his friend , that miss Portman could seldom separate them in her imagination -- and she was just beginning to reflect upon the manner in which Clarence looked , whilst he declared to sir Philip Baddely , that he would never give up Dr. X -- , when she was startled by the entrance of Marriott . 
`` O miss Portman , what shall we do ! 
said Belinda . 
It was some minutes before Belinda could obtain from Marriott any intelligible account of what had happened . 
cried Belinda . 
cried Belinda , `` here they are . '' 
She ran down stairs instantly . 
The first object that she saw was lady Delacour in convulsions -- the street-door was open -- the hall was crowded with servants . 
Belinda made her way through them , and , in a calm voice , requested that lady Delacour might immediately be brought to her own dressing-room , and that she should there be left to Marriott 's care and hers . 
Where 's miss Portman ? '' 
`` Here we are -- you shall be carried quite safely -- trust to me , '' said Belinda , in a firm tone , `` and do not struggle . '' 
`` My ancle is sprained , that 's all , '' said lady Delacour -- `` lay me on this sofa , and leave me to Belinda . '' 
-- she 's in great pain , my lord , '' said Belinda , catching lord Delacour 's arm , just as he was going to strike Clarence Hervey . 
She led him to the sofa where lady Delacour lay , and uncovering her ancle , which was much swelled , showed it to him . 
Marriott was in a great bustle , running backwards and forwards for she knew not what , and continually repeating , `` I wish nobody would come in here but miss Portman and me . 
-- Lord Delacour , '' cried Belinda , springing forward , `` hear me . '' 
answered Belinda . 
-- `` Then a lover of miss Portman 's , '' said lord Delacour -- `` Gad ! 
`` Believe whatever you please , my lord , '' said Belinda hastily -- `` but give me the key . '' 
Clarence Hervey drew the key from lord Delacour 's hand , gave it to miss Portman without looking at her , and immediately withdrew . 
-- Lord Delacour followed him with a sort of drunken laugh ; and no one remained in the room but Marriott , Belinda , and lady Delacour . 
-- Miss Portman locked the room door , and began to undress lady Delacour who lay motionless . 
said Belinda . 
`` Here it is , '' said Belinda , producing it ; and she repeated her question -- `` are you much hurt ? '' 
Whilst Belinda was underssing lady Delacour , she shrieked several times ; but between every interval of pain she repeated , `` I shall be better to morrow . '' 
`` Leave me alone with your lady , Marriott , '' said Miss Portman , taking the bottle of laudanum from her trembling hand , `` and go to bed ; for I am sure you are not able to sit up any longer . '' 
As she spoke , she took Marriott into the adjoining dressing-room . 
-- `` O dear miss Portman , '' said Marriott , who was sincerely attached to her lady , and who at this instant forgot all her jealousies , and all her love of power -- `` I 'll do any thing you ask me -- but pray let me stay in the room , though I know I 'm quite helpless . 
-- `` No , '' said miss Portman firmly . 
`` No , '' said Belinda , `` of that I have given sufficient proof -- but you will betray yourself -- it is already known by your servants that you have been hurt by the overturn of your carriage -- if you do not let either a surgeon or physician see you , it will excite surprise and suspicion , -- It is not in your power when violent pain seizes you to refrain from '' -- `` It is , '' interrupted lady Delacour , `` not another scream shall you hear -- only do not , do not , my dear Belinda , send for a physician . '' 
`` You will throw yourself again into convulsions , '' said Belinda -- `` Marriott you see , has lost all command of herself -- I shall not have strength to manage you -- perhaps I may lose my presence of mind , I can not answer for myself -- your husband may desire to see you . '' 
-- give me the laudanum , dearest Belinda -- and say no more about physicians . '' 
Belinda attempted to persuade her -- `` for my sake , dear lady Delacour , '' said she , `` let me send for Dr. X -- , he is a man of honour , your secret will be perfectly safe with him . '' 
`` Then , '' said Belinda , calmly , but with a fixed determination of countenance , `` I must leave you to morrow morning -- I must return to Bath . '' 
`` Circumstances have occurred , about which I have made no promise , '' said Belinda -- `` I must leave you , unless you will now give me your permission to send for Dr. X -- . '' 
`` You see , '' continued Belinda `` that I am in earnest , when I am gone you will have no friend left -- when I am gone your secret will inevitably be discovered , for without me Marriott will not have sufficient strength of mind to keep it . '' 
`` I am sure you may trust him , '' said Belinda with energy : `` I will pledge my life upon his honour . '' 
No sooner had the words passed lady Delacour 's lips , than Belinda flew to execute her orders . 
-- Marriott recovered her senses , when she heard that her ladyship had consented to send for a physician , but she declared , that she could not conceive how any thing less than the power of magic could have brought her lady to such a determination . 
Belinda had scarcely dispatched a servant for Dr. X -- , when lady Delacour repented of the permission she had given , and all that could be said to pacify , only irritated her temper . 
-- She became delirious , Belinda 's presence of mind never forsook her , she remained quietly beside the bed waiting for the arrival of Dr. X -- , and she absolutely refused admittance to the servants , who , drawn by their lady 's outrageous cries , continually came to her door with offers of assistance . 
About four o'clock the doctor arrived , and miss Portman was relieved from some of her anxiety . 
He assured her that there was no immediate danger , and he promised that the secret which she had entrusted to him should be faithfully kept . 
-- He remained with her some hours , till lady Delacour became more quiet and fell afleep , exhausted with delirious exertions . 
-- `` I think I may now leave you , '' said Dr. X -- , but as he was going through the dressing-room , Belinda stopped him . 
-- `` Now that I have time to think of myself , '' said she -- `` let me consult you as my friend -- I am not used to act entirely for myself , and I shall be most grateful if you will assist me with your advice . 
`` Miss Portman then related all that had passed about the mysterious door , which lord Delacour , in his fit of drunken jealousy , had insisted upon breaking open . 
`` Mr. Hervey , '' continued Belinda , `` was present when all this happened -- he seemed much surprised -- I should be sorry that -- he should remain in an errour which might be fatal to my reputation -- you know a woman ought not even to be suspected -- yet how to remove this suspicion I know not , because I can not enter into any explanation without betraying lady Delacour -- she has , I know , a peculiar dread of Mr. Hervey 's discovering the truth . '' 
`` Hush -- do n't speak so loud , '' said Belinda , `` you will awaken her -- and at present she is certainly more an object of pity than of indignation . 
-- I am not too proud to give positive proofs of my speaking truth ; the key of that room now lies on lady Delacour 's bed -- it was that which she grasped in her hand during her delirium -- she has now let it fall -- it opens both the doors of the boudoir -- you shall see , '' added miss Portman , with a smile , `` that I am not afraid to let you unlock either of them . '' 
-- But , '' continued Dr. X -- , '' my dear miss Portman , you will put a stop to a number of charming stories by this prudence of yours -- a romance called the Mysterious Boudoir , of nine volumes at least , might be written on this subject , if you would only condescend to act like almost all other heroines , that is to say , without common sense . '' 
The doctor now followed Belinda , and satisfied himself by ocular demonstration , that this cabinet was the retirement of disease , and not of pleasure . 
`` O , my dear friend , '' said Hervey , taking his hand -- `` do not jest with me , I am not able to bear your raillery in my present temper -- in one word , I fear that Belinda is unworthy of my esteem -- I can tell you no more -- except that I am more miserable than I thought any woman could make me . '' 
-- I was going to have told you just now , if you would have suffered me to speak connectedly , that you have more reason for jealousy than you suspect , for miss Portman has actually unlocked for me -- for me ! 
look at me -- the door , the mysterious door -- and whilst I live , and whilst she lives , we can neither of us ever tell you the cause of the mystery . 
-- But now you behave like a reasonable creature , you deserve to hear the praises of your Belinda -- I am so much charmed with her , that I wish -- '' `` When can I see her , '' interrupted Hervey , '' I 'll go to her this instant . '' 
`` Gently , '' said Dr. X -- , '' you forget what time of the day it is -- you forget that miss Portman has been up all night -- that lady Delacour is extremely ill -- and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity you could possibly choose for your visit . '' 
To this observation Clarence Hervey assented ; but he immediately seized a pen from the doctor 's writing-table , and began a letter to Belinda . 
`` Doctor , upon second thoughts , '' said Clarence , rising suddenly , and tearing his letter down the middle , `` I can not write to her yet -- I forgot the reformation of lady Delacour -- how soon do you think she will be well ? 
-- Besides , I have another reason for not writing to Belinda -- at present you must know , my dear doctor , that I have , or had , another mistress . '' 
-- Miss Portman was sorry that he was obliged to quit her at this time , but she felt the necessity for his going ; he was sent for to attend Mr. Horton , an intimate friend of his , a gentleman of great talents , and of the most active benevolence , who had just been seized with a violent fever , in consequence of his exertions ? 
Lady Delacour , who heard Dr. X -- giving this account to Belinda , drew back her curtain , and said -- `` Begone this instant , doctor -- I am out of all immediate danger , you say -- but if I were not -- I must die in the course of a few months , you know -- and what is my life or death , compared with the chance of saving your excellent friend ! 
cried Belinda . 
Doctor X -- shook his head -- but returning to Belinda , after going half way down stairs , he added , `` when you read this paper , you will know all that I can tell you upon the subject . '' 
Belinda , the moment the doctor was gone , shut herself up in her own room , to read the paper which he had given to her . 
After reading this paper , Belinda had some faint hopes that lady Delacour 's life might be saved ; but she determined to wait till doctor X -- should return to town , before she mentioned his opinion to his patient ; and she earnestly hoped that no idea of putting herself into ignorant hands would recur to her ladyship . 
Lord Delacour , in the morning , when he was sober , retained but a confused idea of the events of the preceding night ; but he made an awkwardly good natured apology to miss Portman for his intrusion , and for the disturbance he had occasioned , which he said must be laid to the blame of lord Studly 's admirable Burgundy . 
His lordship finished his morning visit to miss Portman , by observing that `` the house would now be very dull for her ; that the office of a nurse was ill-suited to so young and beautiful a lady , but that her undertaking it with so much cheerfulness was a proof of a degree of good nature , that was not always to be met with in the young and handsome . '' 
The manner in which lord Delacour spoke convinced Belinda , that he was in reality attached to his wife , however the fear of being , or of appearing to be governed by her ladyship might have estranged him from her , and from home . 
-- She now saw in him much more good sense , and symptoms of a more amiable character than his lady had described , or than she ever would allow that he possessed . 
The reflections however , which miss Portman made upon the miserable life this ill-matched couple led together did not incline her in favour of marriage in general ; great talents on one side , and good nature on the other , had , in this instance , tended only to make each party unhappy . 
Matches of interest , convenience , and vanity , she was convinced diminished , instead of increasing happiness . 
-- Of domestic felicity she had never , except during her childhood , seen examples -- she had , indeed , heard from Dr. X -- descriptions of the happy family of lady Anne Percival , but she feared to indulge the romantic hope of ever being loved by a man of superiour genius and virtue , with a temper and manners suited to her taste . 
-- Belinda was not guided by her opinions of propriety , and now that her ladyship was confined to her bed , and not in a condition to give her either advice or protection , she felt that it was peculiarly incumbent on her to guard , not only her conduct from reproach , but her heart from the hopeless misery of an ill-placed attachment . 
-- she examined herself with firm impartiality -- she recollected the excessive pain that she had endured , when she first heard Clarence Hervey say , that Belinda Portman was a compound of art and affectation ; but this she thought was only the pain of offended pride -- of proper pride . 
-- She recollected the extreme anxiety she had felt , even within the last four and twenty hours , concerning the opinion which he might form of the transaction about the key of the boudoir -- but this anxiety she justified to herself ; it was due , she thought , to ber reputation ; it would have been inconsistent with female delicacy , to have been indifferent about the suspicions that necessarily arose from the circumstances in which she was placed . 
-- Before Belinda had completed her self-examination , Clarence Hervey called to inquire after lady Delacour . 
-- Clarence was destitute neither of address nor presence of mind , but an accident happened , when he was just taking leave of miss Portman , which threw him into utter confusion . 
-- It surprised , if it did not confound Belinda . 
-- She had forgotten to ask Dr. X -- for his direction ; and as she thought it might be necessary to write to him concerning lady Delacour 's health , she begged of Mr. Hervey to give it to her . 
-- Belinda , though she cast but one involuntary , hasty glance at it , was struck with the beauty of it 's colour , and it 's uncommon length . 
-- The confusion of Clarence Hervey convinced her , that he was extremely interested about the person to whom the hair belonged , and the species of alarm which she had felt at this discovery , opened her eyes effectually to the state of her own heart . 
-- She was sensible that the sight of a lock of hair , however long , or however beautiful , in the hands of any man but Clarence Hervey , could not possibly have excited any emotion in her mind . 
`` Fortunately , '' thought she , `` I have discovered that he is attached to another , whilst it is yet in my power to command my affections , and he shall see that I am not so weak as to form any false expectations from what I must now consider as mere common place flattery . '' 
Belinda was glad that lady Delacour was not present at the discovery of the lock of hair , as she was aware that she would have rallied her unmercifully upon the occasion ; and she rejoiced that she had not been prevailed upon to give madame la comtesse de Pomenars a lock of her belle eltevelure . 
-- When I am fatigued , I will retire , and you , my dear Belinda , shall represent me -- so tell them to open my doors , and unmuffle the knocker -- let me hear the sound of music and dancing , and let the house be filled again , for Heaven 's sake . 
-- Did you , miss Portman ? '' 
Marriott turned sharply round upon miss Portman , and darted a fiery look at her through the midst of her tears . 
`` Give her three minutes grace , and she will come to her senses , '' said lady Delacour -- `` for she is not a bankrupt in sense . 
-- O , three minutes wo n't do , I must allow her three days grace , I perceive , '' said lady Delacour , when Marriott half an hour afterward reappeared , with a face which might have sat for the picture of ill humour . 
-- Seriously , Belinda , is it my fancy , or is not Clarence wonderfully changed ? 
`` More likely because he has been in anxiety about your ladyship , '' said Belinda . 
Notwithstanding the vivacity which she affected , Belinda perceived that she was now more seriously alarmed than she had ever been about her health . 
It was all that her utmost exertions could accomplish , to appear for a short time in the day -- some evenings she came into company only for half an hour , on other days only for a few minutes , just walked through the rooms , paid her compliments to every body , complained of a nervous head ache , left Belinda to do the honours for her , and retired . 
Miss Portman was now really placed in a difficult and dangerous situation , and she had ample opportunities of learning and practising prudence . 
The ladies wondered that the men could think Belinda Portman a beauty ; but whilst they affected to scorn , they sincerely feared her charms . 
-- Thus , left entirely to her own discretion , she was exposed at once to the malignant eye of envy , and the insidious voice of flattery -- she had no friend , no guide , and scarcely a protector : her aunt Stanhope 's letters , indeed , continually supplied her with advice , but with advice which she could not follow consistently with her own feelings and principles . 
Belinda 's prudence seemed to increase with the necessity for it 's exertion . 
About this time sir Philip Baddely began to pay a sort of lounging attention to Belinda -- he knew that Clarence Hervey liked her , and this was the principal cause of his desire to attract her attention . 
-- `` Belinda Portman , '' became his favourite toast , and amongst his companions he gave himself the air of talking of her with rapture . 
`` Rochfort , '' said he , one day to his friend -- `` damme , if I was to think of Belinda Portman in any way , you take me -- Clary would look damned blue -- hey ? 
Accordingly they began by dropping distant mysterious hints about Clarence Hervey , to lady Delacour and miss Portman . 
-- Belinda heard and saw all this in painful silence , but lady Delacour often used her address to draw some farther explanation from sir Philip -- his regular answer was -- `` No , no , your ladyship must excuse me there , I ca n't peach , damme -- hey , Rochfort ? '' 
He was in hopes from the reserve with which miss Portman began to treat Clarence , that he should , without making any distinct charge , succeed in disgusting her with his rival . 
-- Mr. Hervey was about this time less assiduous than formerly in his visits at lady Delacour 's ; sir Philip was there every day , and often for miss Portman 's entertainment exerted himself so far as to tell the news of the town . 
-- I regret it more on miss Portman 's account than on my own , '' said her ladyship . 
-- Belinda assured her that she felt no mortification from the disappointment . 
but I would have driven you in my curricle , '' said sir Philip -- `` It was the finest sight and best conducted I ever saw , and only wanted miss Portman to make it complete . 
-- We had gipsies , and Mrs. Mills the actress for the queen of the gipsies ; and she gave us a famous good song , Rochfort , you know -- and then there was two children upon an ass , damme , I do n't know how they came there , for they 're things one sees every day -- and belonged only to two of , the soldiers wives -- for we had the whole band of the Staffordshire playing at dinner , and we had some famous glees -- and Fawcett gave us his laughing song , and then we had the launching of the ship , and only it was a boat , it would have been well enough -- but damme , the song of Polly Oliver was worth the whole -- except the Flemish Hercules -- du Crow , you know , dressed in light blue and silver -- and miss Portman ! 
-- but I forgot the Pyrrhic dance , miss Portman , which was damned fine too -- danced in moors and spurs by those Hungarian fellows -- they jump and turn about , and clap their knees with their hands , and put themselves in all sorts of ways -- and then we had that song of Polly Oliver , as I told you before , and Mrs. Mills gave us -- no , no -- it was a drummer of the Staffordshire dressed as a gipsy girl , gave us the cottage on the moor , the most charming thing , and would suit your voice , miss Portman -- damme you 'd sing it like an angel -- but where was I ? 
-- Rochfort laughed first , lady Delacour followed him , and Clarence Hervey and Belinda could no longer restrain themselves . 
`` Damme , now I believe you 've all been quizzing me , damme , '' -- cried the baronet , and he fell into a sulky silence , eyeing Clarence Hervey and miss Portman from time to time with what he meant for a knowing look . 
Soon afterward Belinda retired to the music room . 
Sir Philip then begged to speak a few words to lady Delacour , with a face of much importance ; and after a preamble of nonsensical expletives , he said that his regard for her ladyship and miss Portman made him wish to explain hints which had been dropped from him at times , and which he could not explain to her satisfaction , without a promise of inviolable secresy -- `` As Hervey is , or was a sort of a friend , I ca n't , damme , mention this sort of thing without such a preliminary . '' 
-- Lady Delacour gave the preliminary promise , and sir Philip informed her , that people began to take notice that Hervey was an admirer of miss Portman 's , and that it might be a disadvantage to the young lady , as Mr. Hervey could have no serious intentions , because he had an attachment , to his certain knowledge , elsewhere . 
`` Virginia St. Pierre , a pretty romantic name , '' said lady Delacour -- `` miss Portman and I are extremely obliged by your attention to the preservation of our hearts -- and I promise you we shall keep your council , and our own . '' 
Sir Philip then , with more than his usual complement of oaths , pronounced miss Portman to be the finest girl he had ever seen , and took his leave . 
When lady Delacour repeated this story to Belinda , she concluded by saying -- `` Now my dear , you know sir Philip Baddely has his own views in telling us all this -- in telling you all this -- for evidently he admires you , and consequently hates Clarence . 
`` Of no manner of consequence to me , I assure your ladyship , '' said Belinda , `` I have always considered Mr. Hervey as -- '' `` O , as a common acquaintance , no doubt -- but we 'll pass over all those pretty speeches -- I was going to say that this ` mistress of the wood ' can be of no consequence to your happiness , because whatever that fool sir Philip may think , Clarence Hervey is not a man to go and marry a girl who has been his mistress for half a dozen years -- do not look so shocked my dear , I really can not help laughing -- I congratulate you , however , that the thing is no worse -- it is all in rule and incourse -- when a man marries he sets up new equipages , and casts off old mistresses -- or if you like to see the thing as a woman of sentiment , rather than as a woman of the world , here is the prettiest opportunity for your lover 's making a sacrifice . 
Belinda without any haughtiness , but with firm gentleness , replied , `` that she had no designs whatever upon Mr. Hervey , and that therefore there could be no necessity for any manoeuvring on her part . 
`` Did he mention , '' said Belinda , in a low voice -- `` the colour of her hair ? '' 
Here , to Belinda 's great relief , the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Marriott . 
-- From all she had heard , but especially from the agreement between the colour of the hair which dropped from Hervey 's letter with sir Philip 's description of Virginia 's , miss Portman was convinced that Clarence had some secret attachment ; and she could not help blaming him in her own mind , for having , as she thought , endeavoured to gain her affections , whilst he knew that his heart was engaged to another . 
-- Mr. Hervey , however , gave her no farther reason to suspect him of any design to win her love ; for about this time his manner towards her charged , he obviously endeavoured to avoid her ; his visits were short , and his attention was principally directed to lady Delacour ; when she retired , he took his leave , and sir Philip Baddely had the field to himself . 
-- The baronet , who thought that he had succeeded in producing a coldness between Belinda and his rival , was surprised to find , that he could not gain any advantage for himself ; for some time he had not the slightest thoughts of any serious connexion with the lady , but at last he was piqued by her indifference , and by the raillery of his friend Rochfort . 
-- O , damme , Belinda Portman 's a fine girl , but not worth so much as that comes to -- and yet , confound me , if I should not like to see how blue Clary would look , if I were to propose for her in good earnest -- hey , Rochfort ! 
-- At last , what he called love prevailed over prudence , and he was resolved , cost him what it would , to have Belinda Portman . 
`` Damme , '' cried sir Philip , `` one night at lady Delacour 's concert , I think that Mr. Hervey has taken out a patent for talking to miss Portman -- but damme if I give up this place , now I have got it , '' cried the baronet , seating himself beside Belinda . 
Mr. Hervey did not contest his seat , and sir Philip kept his post during the remainder of the concert , but though he had the field entirely to himself , he could not think of any thing more interesting , more amusing , to whisper in Belinda 's ear , than -- `` Do n't you think the candles want snuffing famouslyTaken from real life . 
He waited upon miss Portman , with the certainty of being favourably received ; but he was , nevertheless , somewhat embarrassed to know how to begin the conversation , when he found himself alone with the lady . 
-- Damme now if I do n't believe he thinks nobody else but himself has eyes enough to see that a fine woman 's a fine woman -- but I 'd have him to know , that miss Belinda Portman has been sir Philip Baddely 's toast these two months . '' 
As this intelligence did not seem to make the expected impression upon miss Belinda Portman , sir Philip had recourse again to his little stick , with which he went through the sword exercise -- after a silence of some minutes , and after walking to the window , and back again , as if to look for sense , he exclaimed -- `` How is Mrs. Stanhope now , pray , miss Portman ? 
-- and your sister , Mrs. Tollemache -- she was the finest woman , I thought , the first winter she came out , that ever I saw , damme . 
said Belinda , smiling . 
`` Than the finest woman I had ever seen then , '' said sir Philip , `` for damme I did not know what it was to be in love then , '' -LRB- here the baronet heaved an audible sigh -RRB- `` I always laughed at love , and all that , then , and marriage particularly -- I 'll trouble you for Mrs. Stanhope 's direction , miss Portman ; I believe , to do the thing in style , I ought to write to her before I speak to you . '' 
Belinda looked at him with astonishment , and laying down the pencil , with which she had just begun to write a direction to Mrs. Stanhope , she said -- `` Perhaps , sir Philip , to do the thing in style , I ought to pretend at this instant not to understand you -- but such false delicacy might mislead you -- permit me therefore to say , that if I have any concern in the letter which you are going to write to my aunt Stanhope -- '' `` Well guessed ! '' 
interrupted sir Philip , `` to be sure you have , and you 're a charming girl , damn me if you are n't , for meeting my ideas in this way -- which will save a cursed deal of trouble , '' added the polite lover , seating himself on the sofa , beside Belinda . 
`` To prevent your giving yourself any farther trouble then , sir , on my account , '' said miss Portman -- `` Nay , damme , do n't catch at that unlucky word , trouble , nor look so cursed angry ; though it becomes you too , uncommonly , and I like pride in a handsome woman , if it was only for variety 's sake , for it 's not what one meets with often , nowadays . 
`` To put an end to this heavenly sort of style , Sir , '' said Belinda , withdrawing her hand , which the baronet took , as if he was confident of it 's being his willing prize -- `` I must explicitly assure you , that it is not in my power to encourage your addresses . 
-- I am fully sensible , '' added miss Portman , `` of the honour sir Philip Baddely has done me , and I hope he will not be offended by the frankness of my answer . '' 
`` You ca n't be in earnest , miss Portman ! '' 
`` My objections , '' said Belinda , `` can not be obviated , and therefore it would be useless to state them . '' 
Belinda again assured him that she was entirely in earnest , and that she was incapable of the sort of coquetry which he ascribed to her . 
`` I am sorry to deprive you of so much satisfaction , '' said miss Portman , `` by assuring you , that I am not engaged to any one . '' 
Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of lord Delacour , who came to inquire from miss Portman how his lady did . 
The baronet , after twisting his little black stick into all manner of shapes , finished by breaking it , and then having no other resource , suddenly wished miss Portman a good morning , and decamped with a look of silly ill humour . 
And I am sure miss Portman has too much good sense to think me wrong ; for now miss Portman , in that quarrel about the coach and horses , which you heard part of one morning at breakfast -- I must tell you the beginning of that quarrel . '' 
I wish you could make my lady Delacour of your taste -- she does not want sense -- but then -LRB- I speak to you freely of all that lies upon my mind , miss Portman , for I know -- I know you have no delight in making mischief in a house -RRB- -- between you and me , her sense is not of the right kind . 
said Belinda with a smile , which put his lordship into perfect good humour with both himself and his lady . 
-- But miss Portman , as you like so much to hear the end of quarrels , here 's the end of one which you have a particular right to hear something of , '' continued his lordship , taking out his pocket-book and producing some bank notes -- `` you should have received this before , madam , if I had known of the transaction sooner -- of your part of it , I mean . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said his lordship , and as Champfort came forward to receive the newspaper , his eye glanced at the banknotes , and then at miss Portman . 
`` Here , '' continued lord Delacour , as Champfort had left the room -- `` here are your two hundred guineas , miss Portman , and as I am going to this man about my burgundy , and shall be out all the rest of the day , let me trouble you the next time you see lady Delacour to give her this pocketbook from me . 
-- I should be sorry miss Portman , from any thing that has passed , should run away with the idea that I am a niggardly husband , or a tyrant , though I certainly like to be master in my own house . 
`` Permit me to put it in , my lord , '' said Belinda , returning the pocketbook to him , `` and to beg you will give lady Delacour the pleasure of seeing you : she has inquired several times whether your lordship were at home . 
But , perhaps , the shortness of the visit rendered it the more pleasing , for lady Delacour afterward said to Belinda -- `` My dear , would you believe it , my lord Delacour was absolutely a perfect example of the useful and agreeable this morning -- who knows but he may become the sublime and beautiful in time -- en attendant . 
Here are your two hundred guineas , my dear Belinda -- a thousand thanks for the thing , and a million for the manner -- manner is all in all in conferring favours . 
My lord , who , to do him justice , has too much honesty to pretend to more delicacy than he really possesses , told me that he had been taking a lesson from miss Portman this morning in the art of obliging ; and really , for a grown gentleman , and for the first lesson , he comes on surprisingly . 
said Belinda . 
`` And that , '' said Belinda , `` is the only thing which I do not wish to tell your ladyship . 
Just as Belinda was beginning to sing , Marriott 's macaw began to scream , so that lady Delacour could not hear any thing else . 
-- Her eyes turned with indignation upon Belinda -- from association merely ; because the last time that she had been angry about her macaw , she had also been angry with miss Portman , whom she imagined to be the secret enemy of her favourite . 
It was a delicate and difficult commission -- Belinda found Marriott at first incapable of listening to reason -- `` I am sure there is nobody in the world , that would treat me and my macaw in this manner , except my lady ! '' 
cried she , `` and somebody must have set her against me , for it is not natural to her -- but since she ca n't bear me about her any longer , 't is time I should be gone . '' 
`` The only thing of which lady Delacour complained , was the noise of this macaw , '' said Belinda ; `` it was a pretty bird -- how long have you had it ? '' 
-- O , miss Portman , I would sooner cut off my hand than do it . 
Marriott was beginning the history of Champfort and the doors again , but miss Portman stopped her by saying -- `` All this is past now . 
`` O , miss Portman , take my macaw -- do what you will with it -- only make my peace with my lady , '' cried Marriott , clasping her hands in an agony of grief -- `` here are the fifty guineas , ma'am , do n't leave it with me -- I will never be disrespectful again -- take my macaw and all ! 
The next day Belinda asked the dowager lady Boucher , who was going to a bird fancier 's , to take her with her , in hopes that she might be able to meet with some bird more musical than a macaw , to console Marriott for the loss of her screaming favourite . 
-- Lady Delacour commissioned miss Portman to go to any price she pleased . 
When lady Boucher and Belinda arrived at this bird-fancier 's , they were long in doubt to which of the feathered beauties they should give the preference . 
Whilst the dowager was descanting upon their various perfections , a lady and three children came in ; she immediately attracted Belinda 's attention , by her likeness to Clarence Hervey 's description of lady Ann Percival . 
-- It was lady Ann , as lady Boucher , who was slightly acquainted with her , informed Belinda in a whisper . 
`` Miss Portman , '' said lady Boucher , `` as lady Delacour is so far from well , and wishes to have a bird that will not make any noise in the house , suppose you were to buy for Mrs. Marriott this beautiful pair of green paroquets -- or stay -- a goldfinch is not very noisy , and here is one that can play a thousand pretty tricks . 
Whilst the little boys were looking at the goldfinch , Belinda felt somebody touch her gently . 
Belinda walked to the farthest end of the shop with her . 
said she , in a timid tone , `` I have some gold fish , which you know can not make the least noise ; may I send them to her ? 
-- I heard that lady call you miss Portman ; I believe you are the lady who wrote such a kind postscript to me in mamma 's last letter -- that is the reason I speak so freely to you now . 
Belinda was touched by the manner in which this affectionate little girl spoke to her . 
She assured her that she would say all she wished to her mother , and she begged Helena to send the gold fish whenever she pleased . 
Belinda , when she had finished speaking to Helena , heard the man , who was showing the birds , lament that he had not a blue macaw , which lady Anne Percival was commissioned to procure for Mrs. Margaret Delacour . 
Belinda requested lady Boucher would tell her servants to bring in the cage that contained Marriott 's blue macaw ; and as soon as it was brought , she gave it to Helena , and begged that she would carry it to her aunt Delacour . 
`` Lord , my dear miss Portman , '' said lady Boucher , drawing her aside , `` I am afraid you will get yourself into a scrape , for lady Delacour is not upon speaking terms with this Mrs. Margaret Delacour ; she can not endure her ; you know she is my lord Delacour 's aunt . '' 
Belinda persisted in sending the macaw , for she was in hopes that these terrible family quarrels might be made up , if either party would condescend to show any disposition to oblige the other . 
Lady Anne Percival understood first Portman 's civility as it was meant . 
`` I wish you would do me the favour , lady Boucher , to introduce me to miss Portman , '' continued lady Anne . 
A few minutes conversation passed afterward upon different subjects , and lady Anne Percival and Belinda parted with a mutual desire to see more of each other . 
When Belinda got home , lady Delacour was busy in the library , looking over a collection of French plays with the ci-devant comte de N -- ; a gentleman who possessed such singular talents for reading dramatic compositions , that many people declared that they would rather hear him read a play , than see it performed at the theatre . 
-- `` My dear Belinda ! 
`` I am sure she will like what is coming for her , '' said Belinda , `` and so will your ladyship ; but do not let me interrupt you and monsieur le comte . '' 
And , as she spoke , she took up a volume of plays which lay upon the table . 
`` The scene of L'Ecossaise is laid in London , '' said Belinda ; `` I should think with an English audience it would therefore be popular . '' 
-- Belinda suddenly recollected that it was time to dress for dinner ; but just as the count took his leave , and as she was going up stairs , a footman met her , and told her that Mr. Hervey was in the drawing-room , and wished to speak to her . 
Many conjectures were formed in Belinda 's mind as she passed on to the drawing-room ; but the moment that she opened the door , she knew the nature of Mr. Hervey 's business , for she saw the glass globe containing Helena Delacour 's gold fishes standing on the table beside him . 
`` I have been commissioned to present these to you for lady Delacour , '' said Mr. Hervey ; `` and I have seldom received a commission that has given me so much pleasure -- I perceive that miss Portman is indeed a real friend to lady Delacour -- How happy she is to have such a friend ! '' 
He frankly confessed , that when he was first acquainted with her ladyship , he had looked upon her merely as a dissipated woman of fashion , and he had considered only his own amusement in cultivating her society -- `` But , '' continued he , `` of late I have formed a different opinion of her character ; and I think , from what I have observed , that miss Portman 's ideas on this subject agree with mine . 
I had laid a plan for bringing her ladyship acquainted with lady Anne Percival , who appears to me one of the most amiable and one of the happiest of women . 
Belinda was much pleased by the openness and the unaffected good nature with which Clarence Hervey spoke , and she certainly was not sorry to hear from his own lips a distinct explanation of his views and sentiments . 
She assured him that no effort that she could make with propriety should be wanting , to effect the desirable reconciliation between her ladyship and her family ; as she perfectly agreed with him in thinking , that lady Delacour 's character had been generally misunderstood by the world . 
If lady Delacour had been so fortunate , as to meet with such a friend as miss Portman in her early life , what a different woman she would have been ! 
Mr. Hervey pronounced these last words in a manner more than usually animated ; and whilst he spoke , Belinda stooped to gather a sprig from a myrtle , which stood on the hearth . 
She perceived that the myrtle , which was planted in a large china vase , was propped up on one side with the broken bits of sir Philip Baddely 's little stick : she took them up , and threw them out of the window . 
She told me of miss Portman 's victory over the heart of sir Philip Baddely ; and miss Portman should certainly have allowed them to remain there , as indisputable evidence in favour of the baronet 's taste and judgment . '' 
-- Belinda could not avoid seeing his perplexity -- she had recourse again to the gold fishes , and to Helena : upon these subjects they could both speak very fluently . 
`` Now , miss Portman , the transmission of sound in water , '' said Clarence -- `` Deep in philosophy , I protest ! '' 
`` These gold fishes , '' said Belinda , `` are come to console Marriott for the loss of her macaw . '' 
`` Thank you , my dear Belinda ! 
for these mute comforters , '' said her ladyship -- ` The very best things you could have chosen ! '' 
`` I have not the merit of the choice , '' said Belinda , `` but I am heartily glad that you approve of it . '' 
But these little gold fishes came from a person , who would be very glad to go with you to Harrowgate , '' said Clarence Hervey -- `` or who would be very glad to stay with you in town , '' said Belinda -- `` from a person who wants nothing from you but -- your love . '' 
I have not a female friend in the world but yourself , my dear Belinda ! 
`` Excuse me , '' said Belinda ; `` I can not tell her name , unless you will promise to see her . '' 
`` You have really made me impatient to see her , '' said lady Delacour ; `` but I am not able to go out , you know , yet ; and with a new acquaintance one must go through the ceremony of a morning visit , & c. -- Now , en conscience , is it worth while ? '' 
`` Very well worth while , '' cried Belinda and Clarence Hervey eagerly . 
-- It is some sister , niece , or cousin , of lady Anne Percival 's -- or -- No ; Belinda looks as if I were wrong . 
-- Well , take me where you please , my dear Belinda ! 
`` The ceremony of a morning visit is quite unnecessary here , '' said Belinda : `` I will introduce the unknown friend to you to morrow , if you will let me invite her to your reading party . '' 
She is some charming émigrée of Clarence Hervey 's acquaintance . 
But where did you meet with her this morning ? 
-- If she be half as agreeable and graceful , Clarence , as madame la comtesse de Pomenars , I should not think her acquaintance too dearly purchased by a dozen morning visits . '' 
cried lady Delacour , starting at the sight of Belinda , who was still in her morning dress -- `` Absolutely below par ! 
As she left the room , Belinda heard Clarence Hervey repeat to lady Delacour -- `` Give me a look , give me a face , That makes simplicity a grace ; Robes loosely flowing , hair as free -- '' he paused -- but Belinda recollected the remainder of the stanza -- `` Such sweet neglect more taketh me Than all th ' adulteries of art , That strike mine eyes , but not mine heart . '' 
It was observed , that miss Portman dressed herself this day with the most perfect simplicity . 
Lady Delacour 's curiosity was raised by the description which Belinda and Clarence Hervey had given of the new acquaintance who sent her the gold fishes , and who wanted nothing from her but her love . 
Miss Portman told her , that the unknown would probably come half an hour earlier to the reading party than any of the rest of the company . 
Her ladyship was alone in the library , when lady Anne Percival brought Helena , in consequence of a note from Belinda . 
Miss Portman ran down stairs to the hall to receive her : the little girl took her hand in silence . 
-- `` Your mother was much pleased with the pretty gold fishes , '' said Belinda , `` and she will be still more pleased , when she knows that they came from you : -- she does not know that yet . '' 
I will not make the least noise , '' whispered Helena , as she went up stairs on tiptoe . 
-- You will hear a play read to night , '' said Belinda , `` by that French gentleman whom lady Anne Percival mentioned to me yesterday . '' 
`` Nobody is with her now : so come into the library with me , '' said Belinda . 
said the little girl , and the tears came into her eyes -- Belinda sighed ; and for some moments there was a dead silence . 
`` I mean only to say , miss Portman , '' resumed lady Delacour , `` that I hate ceremony : but I know that there are people in the world who love it , who think all virtue , and all affection , depend on ceremony -- who are `` Content to dwell in decencies for ever . '' 
`` Ceremony sets no value upon affection , and therefore would not desire to be paid with it , '' said Belinda . 
`` Never yet , '' continued lady Delacour , pursuing the train of her own thoughts without attending to Belinda , -- `` never yet was any thing like real affection won by any of these ceremonious people . '' 
`` Never , '' said miss Portman , looking at Helena ; who , having quickness enough to perceive , that her mother aimed this tirade against ceremony at lady Anne Percival , sat in the most painful embarrassment , her eyes cast down , and her face and neck colouring all over . 
-- `` Never yet , '' said miss Portman , `` did a mere ceremonious person win any thing like real affection ; especially from children , who are often excellent , because unprejudiced , judges of character . '' 
`` Facts , I should think , '' said Belinda . 
-- So , it was real modesty made her hesitate , Belinda ? 
I beg your pardon , my dear -- and lady Anne 's -- You see how candid I am , Belinda . 
`` Nobody , mamma ; no one put it into my head -- But I was at the bird-fancier 's yesterday , when miss Portman was trying to get some bird for Mrs. Marriott , that could not make any noise to disturb you : so I thought my fishes would be the nicest things for you in the world ; because they can not make the least noise , and they are as pretty as any birds in the world -- prettier , I think -- and I hope Mrs. Marriott thinks so too . '' 
said Belinda , `` she is in sudden and violent pain -- Do n't be alarmed -- she will be better soon . 
Whilst Belinda was supporting lady Delacour , and whilst Helena was trying to open the window , a servant came into the room , to announce the count de N -- . 
`` Show him into the drawing-room , '' said Belinda . 
-- Clarence Hervey looked at Belinda with a congratulatory smile : -- `` Do not you think , '' whispered he , `` that we shall succeed ? 
Clarence Hervey and Belinda seemed to know one another 's thoughts and feelings this evening , better than they had ever done before during the whole course of their acquaintance . 
Belinda and Clarence Hervey followed her . 
`` Really , it is somewhat singular , Belinda , that I should have opened upon this passage , '' continued she in a low voice , pointing it out to miss Portman . 
As her ladyship turned over the page , she saw a leaf of myrtle which Belinda , who had been reading the story the preceding day , had put into the book for a mark . 
Yours , Belinda , I am sure , by it 's elegance , '' said lady Delacour . 
Belinda and Mr. Hervey assured her , that they had used no such mean arts -- that nothing had been concerted between them . 
`` I can not help believing you , because you never yet deceived me , even in the merest trifle : -- you are truth itself , Belinda . 
My fate , I find , is in your hands : if lady Delacour is ever to be la femme comme il y en a peu , which is the most improbable thing in the world , miss Portman will be the cause of it . '' 
Two hours after her ladyship had retired to her own room , as Belinda was passing by the door to go to her own bed-chamber , she heard lady Delacour call to her . 
`` Belinda , you need not walk so softly , I am not asleep . 
Sit down by my bedside , my dear Belinda ! 
Belinda sat down , and lady Delacour was silent for some minutes . 
`` But surely , '' said Belinda , `` safety must be your first object ? '' 
`` There is no suspicion in her mind , '' said Belinda . 
That young man is worthy of you , Belinda . 
Lady Delacour , after a pause , said , in an altered tone , `` Do you think , Belinda , that I shall survive this operation ? '' 
`` The opinion of doctor X -- , '' said Belinda , `` must certainly be more satisfactory than mine ; '' and she repeated what the doctor had left with her in writing upon this subject . 
`` And can not you , '' said Belinda , `` depend with more security upon the honour of a surgeon who is at the head of his profession , and who has a high reputation at stake , than upon a vague promise of secrecy from some obscure quack , who has no reputation to lose ? '' 
said Belinda with great earnestness . 
let me prevail upon you , '' said Belinda , taking her ladyship 's hand , and pressing it between both of her 's with the most affectionate eagerness . 
Lady Delacour made no answer , but fixed her eyes upon Belinda 's . 
`` Lord Delacour , '' continued miss Portman , `` deserves this from you , by the great interest , the increasing interest , that he has shown of late about your health : his kindness and handsome conduct the other morning certainly pleased you ; and you have now an opportunity of showing that confidence in him , which his affection and constant attachment to you merit . '' 
`` I trouble myself very little about the constancy of lord Delacour 's attachment to me , '' said her ladyship , coldly withdrawing her hand from Belinda . 
For I am no hypocrite ; I have laid open my whole heart to you , Belinda . '' 
`` For that very reason , '' said miss Portman , `` I am eager to use the influence which I know I have in your heart , for your happiness . 
`` But allow me then to speak of my own , '' said Belinda ; `` I can not be concerned in this affair , if it is to be concealed from your husband . '' 
Belinda , though much hurt by the sarcastic tone in which her ladyship spoke , mildly answered , `` That the promise she had made to stay with her ladyship during her illness was very different from an engagement to assist her in such a scheme as she had now in contemplation . '' 
Lady Delacour suddenly drew the curtain between her and Belinda , saying , `` Well , my dear ! 
said Belinda , drawing aside the curtain . 
`` The light blinds me , '' said lady Delacour ; and she turned her face away from miss Portman , and added , in a drowsy voice , `` I will think of what has been said , some time or other : but just now I would rather go to sleep , than say or hear any more ; for I am more than half asleep already . '' 
Belinda closed the curtains , and left the room . 
The extreme eagerness with which Belinda had urged her to consult lord Delacour , and to trust him with her secret , displeased her ; not merely as an opposition to her will , and an undue attention to his lordship 's feelings , but as `` confirmation strong '' of a hint which had been dropped by sir Philip Baddely , but which never till now had appeared to her worthy of a moment 's consideration , Sir Philip had observed , that `` if a young lady had any hopes of being a viscountess , it was no wonder she thought a baronet beneath her notice . '' 
In the first place , Belinda Portman is niece to Mrs. Stanhope ; she may have all her aunt 's art , and the still greater art to conceal it under the mask of openness and simplicity : Volto sciolto , pensieri stretti , is the grand maxim of the Stanhope school . '' 
`` Miss Portman fears that my husband is growing too fond of me : she says , he has been very attentive to me of late . 
Yes , so he has ; and on purpose to disgust him with me , she immediately urges me to tell him that I have a loathsome disease , and that I am about to undergo a horrid operation . 
How my eyes have been blinded by her artifice ! 
Even to night , the sortes Virgilianæ , the myrtle leaf , miss Portman 's mark , left in the book exactly at the place where Marmontel gives a receipt for managing a husband of lord Delacour 's character . 
By her own confession , she had been reading this ; studying it . 
Yes , and she has studied it to some purpose ; she has made that poor weak lord of mine think her an angel . 
How he ran on in her praise the other day , when he honoured me with a morning visit ! 
That morning visit , too , was of her suggestion ; and the bank notes , as he , like a simpleton , let out in the course of the conversation , had been offered to her first . 
She , with a delicacy that charmed my short-sighted folly , begged that they might go through my hands . 
And now I recollect that extraordinary letter of Mrs. Stanhope 's , which I snatched out of miss Portman 's hands some months ago , full of blanks , and inuendoes , and references to some letter which Belinda had written about my disputes with my husband ! 
From that moment to this , miss Portman has never let me see another of her aunt 's letters . 
So I may conclude they are all in the same style ; and I make no doubt that she has instructed her niece , all this time , how to proceed . 
Now I know why she always puts Mrs. Stanhope 's letters into her pocket the moment she receives them , and never opens them in my presence . 
For what was Harriet Freke in comparison with Belinda Portman ? 
But Belinda ! 
-- Oh , Belinda ! 
Exhausted by the emotions to which she had worked herself up by the force of her powerful imagination , lady Delacour , after passing several restless hours in bed , fell asleep late in the morning ; and when she awaked , Belinda was standing by her bed-side . 
said Belinda smiling . 
It is not in human nature , thought lady Delacour , suddenly overcome by the sweet smile and friendly tone of Belinda , -- it is not in human nature to be so treacherous ; and she stretched out both her arms to Belinda , saying , `` You my evil genius ? 
My guardian angel , my dearest Belinda ! 
said Belinda ; `` I believe you are dreaming still , and I am sorry to awaken you ; but I am come to tell you a wonderful thing -- that lord Delacour is up , and dressed , and actually in the breakfast room ; and that he has been talking to me this half hour -- of what do you think ? 
`` Nay , nay , '' said Belinda , `` I know , by the tone of your voice , that you do not mean what you say ; I know you will get up , and come down to us directly -- so I will send Marriott . '' 
Lady Delacour got up , and went down to breakfast , in much uncertainty what to think of miss Portman ; but ashamed to let her into her mind , and still more afraid that lord Delacour should suspect her of doing him the honour to be jealous . 
-- Belinda had not the least guess at what was really passing in her ladyship 's heart ; she implicitly believed her expressions of complete indifference to her lord ; and jealousy was the last feeling which miss Portman would have attributed to lady Delacour , because she unfortunately was not sufficiently aware that jealousy can exist without love . 
The idea of lord Delacour , as an object of attachment ; or of a coronet , as an object of ambition ; or of her friend 's death , as an object of joy , were so foreign to Belinda 's innocent mind , that it was scarcely possible she could decipher lady Delacour 's thoughts . 
`` I am afraid you will , '' said Belinda . 
added lord Delacour , `` that miss Portman , who is so very obliging and good natured , could go just as well with Helena ; and , I am sure , would , rather than that you should tire yourself , or give yourself any unnecessary trouble . '' 
`` Miss Portman is very good , '' answered lady Delacour , hastily ; `` but I think it no unnecessary trouble to give my daughter any pleasure in my power -- As to its tiring me , I am neither dead , nor dying , yet -- For the rest , miss Portman , who understands what is proper , blushes for you , as you see , my lord , when you propose that she , who is not yet a married woman , should chaperon a young lady . 
Lord Delacour was too much in the habit of hearing sarcastic , and to him incomprehensible , speeches from her ladyship , to take any extraordinary notice of this ; -- and if Belinda blushed , it was merely from the confusion into which she was thrown by the piercing glance of lady Delacour 's black eyes -- a glance , which neither guilt nor innocence could withstand . 
Belinda imagined , that her ladyship still retained some displeasure from the conversation that had passed the preceding night ; and the first time that she was alone with lady Delacour , she again touched upon the subject , in hopes of softening or convincing her . 
And all the time that they were out together , she was unusually ceremonious to miss Portman ; and there would have been but little conversation , if Helena had not been present , to whom her mother talked with fluent gayety . 
-- When they came to Maillardet 's , however , lady Delacour saw Mrs. -- getting out of her carriage , and to her she consigned Helena and miss Portman , saying , that she would take a turn or two in the park , and call for them in half an hour . 
''' `` Miss Portman , had you any conversation with lady Anne Percival ? '' 
`` A great deal , '' said Belinda , `` and such as I am sure you would have liked : and so far from being a ceremonious person , I think I never saw any body who had such easy engaging manners . '' 
-- No , mamma ; she said that she was very glad that I was with you ; but she asked miss Portman to come to see her whenever it was in her power . '' 
`` And could miss Portman withstand such a temptation ? '' 
`` You know that I am engaged to your ladyship , '' said Belinda . 
I should be miserable if I apprehended that any one , but more especially miss Portman , felt herself a prisoner in my house . '' 
`` I do not wish to forget it , Belinda , '' said lady Delacour , with emotion ; `` I am not ungrateful , though I may seem capricious -- bear with me . '' 
`` There now , you look like yourself again , and I am satisfied , '' cried Belinda . 
`` I do believe you , '' said lady Delacour , and for a moment she was convinced , that Belinda staid with her for her own sake alone ; but the next minute she suspected , that lord Delacour was the secret cause of her refusing to go to Oakly-park . 
`` What do you say , miss Portman ? '' 
`` Black and orange would look well , I think , '' said Belinda , `` and would suit the lace of your liveries -- would not it ? '' 
`` Nay , miss Portman has a better taste than I have ; and she says black and orange , my lord . '' 
The note was for Belinda -- another pressing invitation to Oakly-park -- and a very civil message from Mrs. Margaret Delacour , and thanks to lady Delacour for the macaw . 
Ay , thought lady Delacour , miss Portman wants to ingratiate herself in time with all my husband 's relations . 
`` Mrs. Margaret Delacour should have addressed these thanks to you , miss Portman , for I had not the grace to think of sending her the macaw . '' 
Lord Delacour , who was very fond of his aunt , immediately joined his thanks , and observed , that miss Portman was always considerate -- always obliging -- always kind . 
Then he drank her health in a bumper of burgundy , and insisted upon his little Helena 's drinking her health . 
for miss Portman is very good -- too good to you , child . '' 
`` Miss Portman , your health . '' 
`` And I hope , '' continued his lordship , after swallowing his bumper , `` that my lady Anne Percival does not mean to enveigle you away from us , miss Portman . 
You do n't think of leaving us , miss Portman , I hope ? 
Here 's Helena would break her little heart ; -- I say nothing for my lady Delacour , because she can say every thing so much better for herself ; and I say nothing for myself , because I am the worst man in the world at making speeches , when I really have a thing at heart -- as I have your staying with us , miss Portman . '' 
Belinda assured him , that there was no occasion to press her to do what was perfectly agreeable to her , and said that she had no thoughts of leaving lady Delacour . 
Helena , with artless joy , threw her arms about Belinda , and exclaimed , `` I am glad you are not going ! 
`` The more you know of miss Portman , the more you will like her , child -- at least , I have found it so , '' said lord Delacour . 
-- For an instant Belinda was struck with the tone of pique and reproach , in which her ladyship spoke . 
said Belinda , with a look of such unfeigned surprise , that her ladyship instantly changed countenance , and , taking her hand with gayety , said , `` So , my little Belinda ! 
You see the reformation is beginning -- Clarence Hervey and Miss Portman can do wonders . 
Whenever lady Delacour 's suspicions of Belinda were suspended , all her affections returned with double force ; she wondered at her own folly , she was ashamed that she could have let such ideas enter her mind , and she was beyond measure astonished that any thing relative to lord Delacour could so far have interested her attention . 
`` Luckily , '' said she to herself , `` he has not the penetration of a blind beetle ; and , besides , he has little snug jealousies of his own ; so he will never find me out . 
But it is impossible I should ever be a jealous wife : I am only a jealous friend , and I must satisfy myself about Belinda . 
The next day , when they came to the exhibition , lady Delacour had an opportunity of judging of Belinda 's real feelings . 
said sir Philip : And the two gentlemen , laughing significantly , followed lady Delacour and Belinda into the rooms . 
repeated Rochfort ; `` and we 'll leave it to your ladyship 's and miss Portman 's taste and judgment to find it out ; -- May n't we , sir Philip ? '' 
But he was so impatient to direct her eyes , that he could not keep himself still an instant . 
your ladyship has the best taste in the world , every body knows ; and so has miss Portman -- and this picture will hit her taste particularly , I 'm sure . 
`` I 'll take my oath as to the portrait 's being a devilish good likeness , '' added sir Philip ; and , as he spoke , he turned to miss Portman -- `` Miss Portman has it ! 
miss Portman has him ! '' 
Belinda hastily withdrew her eyes from the picture at which she was looking . 
-- `` But this seems to be a foreign beauty , '' continued lady Delacour , `` if one may judge by her air , her dress , and the scenery about her -- cocoa-trees , plantains -- miss Portman , what think you ? '' 
`` I think , '' said Belinda -LRB- but her voice faultered so much that she could hardly speak -RRB- , `` that it is a scene from Paul and Virginia . 
Whilst her ladyship leant her ear to this whisper , which was sufficiently audible , she fixed a seemingly careless , but most observing , inquisitive eye upon poor Belinda . 
Her confusion , for she heard the whisper , was excessive . 
`` She loves Clarence Hervey -- she has no thoughts of lord Delacour and his coronet -- I have done her injustice , '' thought lady Delacour , and instantly she dispatched sir Philip out of the room , for a catalogue of the pictures , begged Mr. Rochfort to get her something else , and , drawing miss Portman 's arm within hers , she said , in a low voice , `` Lean upon me , my dearest Belinda ! 
thought Belinda , as she kept her eyes fixed , in silent anguish , upon the picture of Virginia : -- `` No , he can not do this ; if he could , he would be unworthy of me , and I ought to think of him no more . 
She turned abruptly away from the picture , and she saw Clarence Hervey standing beside her . 
Well , we shall not force you to be in raptures with it -- shall we miss Portman ? 
Belinda ventured to take her eyes for an instant from the picture , to see whether Clarence Hervey looked like the most inconstant man upon earth . 
He was intently gazing upon her ; but as soon as she looked up , he suddenly exclaimed , as he turned to the picture -- `` A heavenly countenance indeed ! 
`` Certainly , '' said Belinda ; -- and from the composure with which Mr. Hervey now spoke , she was suddenly inclined to believe , or to hope , that all sir Philip 's story was false . 
-- Helena had just taken miss Portman into a little room , where Westal 's drawings were hung , to show her a group of lady Anne Percival and her children ; and Belinda was alone with the little girl , when Mr. Hervey came to bid her adieu . 
`` Miss Portman , I shall not , I am afraid , see you again for some time ; -- perhaps I may never have that -- hem ! 
`` Yes ; '' said Belinda much surprised , `` I believe -- I am not quite certain -- but -- I believe I shall stay with her ladyship some time longer . '' 
Helena drew her hand gently away from Belinda , left the room , and retired to her mother . 
`` That child , miss Portman , is very fond of you , '' said Mr. Hervey . 
Speak to me with sincerity , '' said Belinda , `` and you will deserve that I should think you my friend . '' 
She trembled excessively , but spoke and looked with all the firmness that she could command . 
It is whispered , that if lady Delacour should die -- '' At the word die , Belinda started . 
`` That if lady Delacour should die , miss Portman would become the mother of Helena ! '' 
I never saw any of your sex , who appeared to me to have so much prudence , and so little art -- But -- farewell -- I have not a moment to lose , '' added Clarence , suddenly checking himself ; and he hurried away from Belinda , who stood fixed to the spot where he left her , till she was roused by the voices of several people who came into the room to see the drawings . 
She started as if from a dream , and went immediately in search of lady Delacour . 
Sir Philip Baddeley was in earnest conversation with her ladyship ; but he stopped speaking when Belinda came within hearing , and lady Delacour turned to Helena , and said , `` My dear , if you are satisfied , for mercy 's sake let us begone , for I am absolutely overcome with heat -- and with curiosity , '' added she in a low voice to Belinda -- `` I long to hear how Clarence Hervey likes Westal 's drawings . '' 
`` And now sit down , my dear Belinda ! '' 
Whilst Belinda was pulling the carnation to pieces , she recollected what Mr. Hervey had said to her about mysteries : his words still sounded in her ear . 
I will have the courage to speak the truth , thought she , whatever it may cost me . 
`` The only pretty thing that Mr. Hervey said was , that he never saw any woman who had so much prudence and so little art , '' said Belinda . 
said her ladyship , letting down her veil over her face , `` the fire of my eyes is not too much for you now . '' 
`` Then , to dash into the midst of things at once , '' said miss Portman , speaking very quick , `` Mr. Hervey observed , that miss Delacour was growing very fond of me . '' 
cried her ladyship -- '' Et puis ? '' 
She rose hastily to leave the room , but Miss Portman caught her hand -- `` You wo n't go , I hope , lady Delacour , '' said she , `` till I have finished my long story ? '' 
Lady Delacour sat down again , ashamed of her own embarrassment , when she saw that Belinda was so calm and composed . 
Whether this be art , innocence , or assurance , thought she , I can not tell ; but we shall see . 
He came to apologize to miss Portman for having , by mistake , broken the seal of a letter to her , which had been sent under cover to him . 
He gave miss Portman the letter , and left the room . 
This explanation was perfectly satisfactory to Belinda ; but lady Delacour , prejudiced by the hesitation of Champfort , could not help suspecting , that this letter was merely the ostensible cause of his lordship 's visit . 
`` From my aunt Stanhope , '' said miss Portman , as she opened her letter . 
She folded it up again after glancing over the first page , and put it into her pocket , colouring deeply . 
`` Miss Portman , '' said she , `` I hope your politeness to me does not prevent you from reading your letter ? 
Belinda had but just unfolded her letter again , when lord Delacour returned , followed by Champfort , who brought with him a splendid hammer-cloth . 
said lady Delacour coldly , and she fixed her eyes upon the fringe , which was black and orange -- `` Miss Portman 's taste , I see ! '' 
And she said to herself , `` Miss Portman will order my liveries next ! 
But this shall go on till I have full conviction of her views . '' 
Lord Delacour retired satisfied ; and miss Portman sat down to read the following letter from her aunt Stanhope . 
MY DEAR BELINDA , `` I received safely the bank notes for my two hundred guineas , enclosed in your last . 
-- So I see no possible objection to sir Philip , my dear Belinda ! 
I always foretold , that my Belinda would marry better than her sister , or any of her cousins , and take place of them all . 
, `` Mrs. Stanhope seems to have written you a volume instead of a letter , miss Portman ! '' 
cried lady Delacour as Belinda turned over the sheets of her aunt 's long epistle . 
-- said lady Delacour , again looking up from her writing at Belinda , who sat motionless , leaning her head upon her hand as if in deep thought -- Mrs. Stanhope 's unfolded letter hanging from her hand . 
When she was roused by her ladyship 's question , `` No bad news , I hope , miss Portman ? '' 
Lady Delacour never raised her eyes whilst Belinda spoke , but went on scratching out some words in what she was writing . 
Through the mask of paint which she wore , no change of colour could be visible ; and as Belinda did not see the expression of her ladyship 's eyes , she could not in the least judge of what was passing in her mind . 
`` You have acted in the most prudent manner possible , miss Portman , '' said her ladyship , as she went on sealing her notes , `` by speaking at once to me of this strange , scandalous , absurd report . 
`` From my own judgment and knowledge of your character , in which I hope -- I am not -- I can not be mistaken , '' said Belinda , looking at her with a mixture of doubt and astonishment . 
`` No -- you calculated admirably -- 't was the best , the only thing you could do -- Only , '' said her ladyship , falling back in her chair with an hysteric laugh , `` only the blunder of Champfort , and the entrance of my lord Delacour , and the hammercloth with the orange and black fringe . 
But you , '' added she , wiping her eyes , and recovering from laughter , `` you have such admirable presence of mind , nothing disconcerts you ! 
You are equal to all situations , and stand in no need of such long letters of advice from your aunt Stanhope , '' pointing to the two folio sheets which lay at Belinda 's feet . 
The rapid , unconnected manner in which lady Delacour spoke , the hurry of her motions , the quick , suspicious , angry glances of her eye , her laugh , her unintelligible words , all conspired at this moment to give Belinda the idea that her intellects were suddenly disordered . 
She was so firmly persuaded of her ladyship 's utter indifference to lord Delacour , that she never conceived the possibility of her being actuated by the passion of jealousy -- by the jealousy of power -- a species of jealousy which she had never felt , and could not comprehend . 
But she had sometimes seen lady Delacour in starts of passion that seemed to border on insanity , and the idea of her losing all command of her reason now struck Belinda with irresistible force . 
Miss Portman 's hands trembled as she turned over the pages of the letter . 
Conscious that this letter was not fit for her ladyship to see , Belinda neither offered to show it to her , nor attempted any apology for her reserve and embarrassment , but hastily began to read the message relative to Mrs. Luttridge ; her voice gaining confidence as she went on , as she observed that she had fixed lady Delacour 's attention , who now sat listening to her , calm and motionless . 
But when miss Portman came to the words `` Do not forget to tell lady D -- , that I have a charming anecdote for her about another friend of hers , who lately went over to the enemy , '' -- her ladyship exclaimed with great vehemence , `` Friend ! 
-- and she put her hand to her head . 
said Belinda , in a calm gentle tone ; and she went towards her with an intention of soothing her by caresses : but , at her approach , lady Delacour pushed the table on which she had been writing from her with violence ; started up , flung back the veil which fell over her face as she rose , and darted upon Belinda a look which fixed her to the spot where she stood . 
Belinda 's blood ran cold -- she had no longer any doubt that this was insanity . 
She shut the penknife which lay upon the table , and put it in her pocket . 
-- Sit down -- For Heaven 's sake listen to me , to your friend , to Belinda ! '' 
my Belinda ! '' 
She paused -- her eyes involuntarily returned upon Belinda . 
`` Oh Belinda ! 
The tears rolled fast down her painted cheeks ; she wiped them hastily away , and so roughly , that her face became a strange and ghastly spectacle . 
Unconscious of her disordered appearance , she rushed past Belinda , who vainly attempted to stop her , threw up the sash , and , stretching herself far out of the window , gasped for breath . 
Miss Portman drew her back , and closed the window , saying , `` The rouge is all off your face , my dear lady Delacour ! 
Look at your face in this glass -- you see -- '' `` I see , '' interrupted lady Delacour , looking full at Belinda , `` that she who I thought had the noblest of souls has the meanest ! 
She flung herself upon the sofa , and struck her forehead with her hand violently several times . 
Belinda catching her arm , and holding it with all her force , cried in a tone of authority -- `` Command yourself , lady Delacour ! 
-- Could Mrs. Stanhope herself -- could you , miss Portman , speak in a softer , milder , more polite , more proper tone than I do now ? 
`` I am better satisfied -- a little better satisfied , '' said Belinda . 
But tell me , good , gentle , prudent miss Portman , why need you dread so much that I should go mad ? 
Oh , Belinda ! 
`` I have seen it long : -- I pity you from the bottom of my soul , '' said Belinda , and she burst into tears . 
`` Yes , call me perfidious , treacherous , -- stamp at me -- say , do what you will ; I can and will bear it all -- all patiently ; for I am innocent , and you are mistaken and unhappy , '' said Belinda . 
`` Fondle me not , '' said lady Delacour , starting back from Belinda 's caresses -- `` Do not degrade yourself to no purpose -- I never more can be your dupe -- Your protestations of innocence are wasted on me -- I am not so blind as you imagine -- Dupe as you think me , I have seen much in silence . 
-- To save your reputation , you want my friendship -- you want -- '' `` I want nothing from you , lady Delacour , '' said Belinda -- '' You have suspected me long in silence -- Then I have mistaken your character , I can love you no longer -- Farewell for ever ! 
She walked away from lady Delacour with proud indignation ; but , before she reached the door , she recollected her promise to remain with this unfortunate woman . 
thought Belinda , and she stopped short . 
-- `` No , lady Delacour , '' cried she , `` I will not yield to my humour -- I will not listen to my pride . 
`` What comes next , miss Portman ? '' 
`` Yes , my dear , '' said Belinda . 
But at this instant she heard the sound of lord Delacour 's voice upon the stairs , and she broke from the little girl , and with the greatest precipitation retreated to her own room . 
She had not been alone above half an hour before Marriott knocked at the door . 
`` Miss Portman , you do n't know how late it is . 
`` I am going to Oakly-park with lady Anne Percival , '' said Belinda calmly . 
But , good dear miss Portman , can you leave my poor lady when she wants you so much -- and I 'll take upon me to say , ma'am , loves you so much at the bottom of her heart ? 
`` Your regard to your lady deserves the highest approbation , Marriott , '' said Belinda . 
Nothing could equal lady Delacour 's astonishment , when she learnt from Marriott that miss Portman was actually preparing to leave the house . 
After a moment 's reflection , however , she persuaded herself that this was only a new artifice to work upon her affections ; that Belinda did not mean to leave her ; but that she would venture all lengths , in hopes of being at the last moment pressed to stay . 
Under this persuasion , lady Delacour resolved to disappoint her expectations ; she determined to meet her with that polite coldness , which would best become her own dignity , and which , without infringing the laws of hospitality , would effectually point out to the world , that lady Delacour was no dupe , and that miss Portman was an unwelcome inmate in her house . 
The power of assuming gayety when her heart was a prey to the most poignant feelings , she had completely acquired by long practice . 
Fresh rouged , and elegantly dressed , she was performing her part to a brilliant audience in her drawing-room , when Belinda entered . 
Belinda beheld her with much astonishment , but more pity . 
`` Miss Portman , '' said her ladyship , turning carelessly towards her , `` where do you buy your rouge ? 
Lady Singleton , would you rather at this moment be mistress of the philosopher 's stone , or have a patent for rouge that will come and go like miss Portman 's ? 
Her ladyship was running on to a fresh train of ideas , when a footman announced the arrival of lady Anne Percival 's carriage ; and miss Portman rose to depart . 
`` You dine with lady Anne , miss Portman , I understand ? 
-- My compliments to her ladyship , and my duty to Mrs. Margaret Delacour , and her maccaw . 
-- So , miss Portman , instead of adieu , I shall only say -- Au revoir ! '' 
said Belinda with a look and tone which struck her ladyship to the heart . 
All her supicions , all her pride , all her affected gayety vanished ; her presence of mind forsook her , and for some moments she stood motionless and powerless . 
Then recollecting herself , she flew after miss Portman abruptly , stopped her at the head of the stairs , and exclaimed , `` My dearest Belinda , are you gone ? 
repeated Belinda . 
It was all she could say ; and she broke from lady Delacour , and hurried out of the house with the strongest feeling of compassion for this unhappy woman , but with an unaltered sense of the propriety and necessity of her own firmness . 
There was an air of benevolence and perfect sincerity in the politeness , with which lady Anne Percival received Belinda , that was peculiarly agreeable to her agitated and harassed mind . 
`` I am afraid , '' said Belinda , `` that your ladyship will think me capricious for coming to you at last an unbidden guest , after having so often refused your kind invitations . '' 
Lady Anne Percival could not avoid suspecting , that something disagreeable had passed between lady Delacour and Belinda ; but she was not troubled with the disease of idle curiosity , and her example prevailed upon Mrs. Margaret Delacour , who dined with her , to refrain from all questions and comments . 
The prejudice , which this lady had conceived against our heroine , as being a niece of Mrs. Stanhope 's , had lately been vanquished by the favourable representations of her conduct which she had heard from her nephew , and by the kindness that Belinda had shown to little Helena . 
`` Madam , '' said Mrs. Delacour , addressing herself to miss Portman with some formality , but much dignity , `` permit me , as one of my lord Delacour 's nearest relations now living , to return you my thanks , for having , as my nephew informs me , exerted your influence over lady Delacour for the happiness of his family . 
My little Helena , I am sure , feels her obligations towards you , and I rejoice that I have had an opportunity of expressing , in person , my sense of what our family owes to miss Portman . 
As to the rest , her own heart will reward her . 
However , it deserves to be mentioned , as an instance of the world 's candour , and for the singularity of the case , that every body agrees in speaking well even of so handsome a young lady as miss Portman . '' 
`` She must have had extraordinary prudence , '' said lady Anne ; `` and the world does justly to reward it with extraordinary esteem . '' 
Belinda , with equal pleasure and surprise , observed that all this was said naturally , and that the report , which she had feared was public , had never reached Mrs. Delacour , or lady Anne Percival . 
Piqued by the manner in which his addresses had been received by Belinda , he readily listened to the comfortable words of his valet de chambre , who assured him that he had it from the best possible authority -LRB- lord Delacour 's own gentleman , Mr. Champfort , -RRB- that his lordship was deeply taken with miss Portman -- that the young lady managed every thing in the house -- that she had been very prudent , to be sure , and had refused large presents -- but that there was no doubt of her becoming lady Delacour , if ever his lordship should be at liberty . 
She never thought of Belinda 's mentioning this report to her ladyship , because she would never have dealt so openly , had she been in the place of her niece . 
Thus her art and falsehood operated against her own views , and produced consequences diametrically opposite to her expectations . 
-- It was her exaggerations that made Clarence Hervey speak to Belinda ; and that made lady Delacour believe , when Belinda repeated what he had said , that this report was universally known and credited ; her own suspicions were by these means again awakened , and her jealousy and rage were raised to such a pitch , that , no longer mistress of herself , she insulted her friend and guest . 
Miss Portman was then obliged to do the very thing that Mrs. Stanhope most dreaded ; to leave lady Delacour 's house and all it 's advantages . 
As to sir Philip Baddely , Belinda never thought of him from the moment she read her aunt 's letter till after she had left her ladyship ; her mind was firmly decided upon this subject ; yet she could not help fearing , that her aunt would not understand her reasons , or approve her conduct . 
She wrote to Mrs. Stanhope in the most kind and respectful manner ; assured her that there had been no foundation whatever for the report , which had produced so much uneasiness ; that lord Delacour had always treated her with politeness and good nature , but that such thoughts or views as had been attributed to him , she was convinced , had never entered his lordship 's mind ; that hearing of the publicity of this report had , however , much affected lady D -- . 
`` I have therefore , '' said Belinda , `` thought it prudent to quit her ladyship , and to accept of an invitation from lady Anne Percival to Oakly-park . 
On this subject Belinda , though she declared her own sentiments with firm sincerity , touched as slightly as she could , because she anxiously wished to avoid all appearance of braving the opinions of an aunt , to whom she was under obligations . 
Belinda , just when the carriage was at the door to take her to Oakly-park , received the following angry answer from Mrs. Stanhope : `` Henceforward , Belinda , you may manage your own affairs as you think proper ; I shall never more interfere with my advice . 
But the passions run away with people , and they forget every thing -- common sense , gratitude , and all -- as you do , Belinda . 
The regret which Belinda felt at having grievously offended her aunt was somewhat alleviated by the reflection that she had acted with integrity and prudence . 
Thrown off her guard by anger , Mrs. Stanhope had inadvertently furnished her niece with the best possible reasons against following her advice with regard to sir Philip Baddely , by stating that her sister and cousins , who had married with mercenary views , had made themselves miserable , and had shown their aunt neither gratitude nor respect . 
It is scarcely necessary to say , that Belinda did not return to lady Delacour , nor change her mind with respect to sir Philip Baddely ; but as soon as she had read this letter , she got into the carriage with lady Anne Percival , and they pursued their journey to Oakly-park . 
The tranquillity of Belinda 's mind was gradually restored by the society that she enjoyed there . 
She found herself in the midst of a large and cheerful family , with whose domestic happiness she could not forbear to sympathise . 
There was an affectionate confidence , an unconstrained gayety in this house , which forcibly struck her , from it 's contrast with what she had seen at lady Delacour 's . 
The children were treated neither as slaves nor as playthings , but as reasonable creatures ; and the ease with which they were managed , and with which they managed themselves , surprised Belinda ; for she heard none of that continual lecturing which goes forward in some houses , to the great fatigue and misery of all the parties concerned , and of all the spectators . 
Belinda was convinced by this comparison , that domestic life was that which could alone make her really and permanently happy . 
She missed none of the pleasures , none of the gay company , to which she had been accustomed at lady Delacour 's . 
She was conscious at the end of each day , that it had been agreeably spent ; yet there were no extraordinary exertions made to entertain her , every thing seemed in it 's natural course , and so did her mind . 
She had not been at Oakly-park a week , before she forgot that it was within a few miles of Harrowgate , and she never once recollected her vicinity to this fashionable water-drinking place for a month afterward . 
But to deal fairly with our readers , we must not omit to mention a certain Mr. Vincent , who came to Oakly-park during the first week of Belinda 's visit , and who stayed there during the whole succeeding month of felicity . 
At the first sight of Belinda , he did not seem much struck with her appearance ; perhaps , from his thinking that there was too little languor in her eyes , and too much colour in her cheeks : he confessed that she was graceful , but her motions were not quite slow enough to please him . 
It is somewhat singular , that lady Delacour 's faithful friend , Harriet Freke , should be the cause of Mr. Vincent 's first fixing his favourable attention on miss Portman . 
This conversation passed before miss Portman and Charles Percival , who were walking in the park with Mr. Vincent , at the time he met Juba and asked him to go for the tambarine . 
Belinda and the little boy walked on to leave him at liberty to speak ; and then , though with a sort of reluctant horrour , he told that the figure of an old woman , all in flames , had appeared to him in his bedchamber at Harrowgate every night , and that he was sure she was one of the obeah-women of his own country , who had pursued him to Europe to revenge his having once , when he was a child , trampled upon an egg shell that contained some of her poisons . 
The first person that he happened to meet after this conversation was Belinda , to whom he eagerly related it , because he had observed , that she had listened with much attention and sympathy to the beginning of the poor fellow 's story . 
The moment that she heard of the flaming apparition , she recollected having seen a head drawn in phosphorus , which one of the children had exhibited for her amusement , and it occurred to her that , perhaps , some imprudent or ill-natured person might have terrified the ignorant negro by similar means . 
When she mentioned this to Mr. Vincent , he recollected the threat that had been thrown out by Mrs. Freke , the day that Juba had taken possession of the disputed coach-house ; and from the character of this lady , Belinda judged that she would be likely to play such a trick , and to call it as usual fun or frolic . 
Miss Portman proposed that a figure should be drawn with phosphorus , as nearly as possible to resemble that which Juba had described , and that it should be shown to him at night , to try whether it would excite his apprehensions . 
Belinda then suggested that one of the children should show him the phosphorus , and should draw some ludicrous figure with it in his presence . 
This was done , and it had the effect that she expected . 
Juba , familiarised by degrees with the object of his secret horrour , and convinced that no obeah-woman was exercising over him her sorceries , recovered his health and spirits . 
His gratitude to miss Portman , who was the immediate cause of his cure , was as simple and touching as it was lively and sincere . 
This was the circumstance which first turned Mr. Vincent 's attention towards Belinda . 
The ladies came to high words upon the occasion , and an irreparable breach would have ensued , had not Mrs. Freke , in the midst of her rage , recollected Mr. Luttridge 's electioneering interest : and suddenly changing her tone , she declared that `` she was really sorry to have driven Mr. Vincent from Harrowgate ; that her only intention was to get rid of his black ; she would lay any wager that , with Mrs. Luttridge 's assistance , they could soon get the gentleman back again ; '' and she proposed as a certain method of fixing Mr. Vincent in Mrs. Luttridge 's society , to invite Belinda to Harrowgate . 
As to Vincent , you may be sure Belinda Portman is his only inducement for staying with that precious family party ; and if we have her , we have him . 
Now , we can be sure of her , for she has just quarrelled with our dear lady Delacour . 
She drove in her unicorn to Oakly-park , to pay miss Portman a visit . 
She had no acquaintance either with Mr. Percival or lady Anne , and she had always treated Belinda , when she met her in town , rather cavalierly , as an humble companion of lady Delacour . 
Belinda was alone , and reading , when Mrs. Freke dashed into the room . 
She flung herself upon the sofa beside Belinda , threw her hat upon the table , and then continued speaking . 
Belinda , who had not been suffered to utter a word whilst Mrs. Freke ran on in this strange manner , looked in unfeigned astonishment ; but when she found herself seized and dragged towards the door , she drew back with a degree of gentle firmness that equally astonished Mrs. Freke . 
`` The courage to be bad , '' said Belinda , `` I believe , indeed , that she does not possess . '' 
`` If I had , '' said Belinda , `` I hope that I should still do justice to her merits . 
`` Mr. Hervey was not in town when I left it , '' said Belinda . 
`` I fancy that you are entirely mistaken both with respect to Mr. Hervey and lady Delacour , '' Belinda very seriously began to say ; but Mrs. Freke interrupted her , and ran on -- `` No ! 
She had set her heart upon winning Belinda over to her party . 
`` You forget , '' said Belinda , `` that it is not Milton , but Satan , who says , ` Fallen spirit , to be weak is to be miserable . '' 
`` But to make them up , '' replied Belinda , `` may it not be useful ? '' 
continued Mrs. Freke , who did not choose to attend to this question ; exclaiming as she reviewed each of the books on the table in their turns , in the summary language of presumptuous ignorance . 
said she , taking up a book in which she saw Belinda 's mark , `` Essay on the Inconsistency of Human Wishes . ' 
Belinda declined this invitation , and Mrs. Freke strode away to the window to conceal her mortification , threw up the sash , and called out to her groom , `` Walk those horses about , block-head ! '' 
She thought , that if Belinda 's opinion of the understanding of these Percivals could be lowered , she should rise in her opinion : accordingly , she determined to draw Mr. Percival into an argument . 
`` I 've been talking treason , I believe , to miss Portman , '' cried she , `` for I 've been opposing some of your opinions , Mr. Percival . '' 
What say you , miss Portman ? 
`` Miss Portman 's blushes , '' said Mr. Vincent , `` speak for her . '' 
`` Against her , '' -- said Mrs. Freke -- `` Women blush because they understand . '' 
`` But you have not proved the hypocrisy , '' said Belinda . 
Belinda , surprised by this question from a woman , was too much abashed instantly to answer . 
Without sharing in any degree that confusion which Belinda felt for her , she strode out of the room , saying , `` Miss Portman , you understand these things better than I do ; come and set me to rights . '' 
When she was in Belinda 's room , she threw herself into an arm chair , and laughed immoderately . 
said she . 
`` I am glad you think so , '' said Belinda ; `` for I really was afraid he had been too severe upon you . '' 
`` There seems to have been more danger of that for you than for any body else , '' said Belinda , as she assisted to set Mrs. Freke 's rigging , as she called it , to rights . 
As Mrs. Freke saw no other chance left of gaining her point with Belinda , she tried what intimidating her would do . 
`` I stop at nothing , '' repeated she , fixing her eyes upon miss Portman , to fascinate her by terrour . 
`` It is not in my power , madam , '' said Belinda calmly , `` to comply with your request . '' 
Mrs. Freke 's conversation , though at the time it confounded Belinda , roused her , upon reflection , to examine by her reason for the habits and principles which guided her conduct . 
She had a general feeling that they were right and necessary ; but now , with the assistance of lady Anne and Mr. Percival , she established in her own understanding the exact boundaries between right and wrong . 
`` Miss Portman , '' said Mr. Percival , `` are not you afraid of making an enemy of Mrs. Freke , by declining her invitation to Harrowgate ? '' 
`` I think her friendship more to be dreaded than her enmity , '' replied Belinda . 
`` Not in the least , unless she were to come in the shape of a false friend , '' said Belinda . 
`` if , '' said Belinda ; `` but that is a question which you have not yet decided . '' 
`` I am sensible , '' said he , `` that I have many prejudices : -- miss Portman has made me ashamed of some of them . '' 
There was a degree of candour in Mr. Vincent 's manner and conversation which interested every body in his favour ; Belinda amongst the rest . 
She was perfectly at ease in Mr. Vincent 's company , because she considered him as a person who wished for her friendship , without having any design to engage her affections . 
Miss Portman was not one of those young ladies who fancy that every gentleman who converses freely with them will inevitably fall a victim to the power of their charms , and who see in every man a lover , or nothing . 
`` Miss Portman , who is very good natured , will , I am sure , be so good , when she goes back to lady Delacour , as to carry food for the gold fishes to Helena -- You see that I have found out a way to keep my promise . '' 
`` No , I am afraid not , '' said Belinda ; `` for I am not going back to lady Delacour 's . '' 
Belinda , to Mr. Vincent 's great relief , seemed not to take any notice of the child 's question , nor to have any sympathy in his curiosity ; she was intently copying Westal 's sketch of lady Anne Percival and her family ; and she had been roused , by the first mention of Helena Delacour 's name , to many painful and some pleasing recollections . 
`` Yes , '' said Belinda , `` and how much more interesting this picture is to us , from our knowing that it is not a fancy-piece ; that the happiness is real , not imaginary ; that this is the natural expression of affection in the countenance of the mother ; and that these children , who crowd round her , are what they seem to be , the pride and pleasure of her life ! '' 
O , miss Portman ! 
`` Is it possible , sir , '' said Belinda , `` that you should suspect me of such wretched hypocrisy , as to affect to admire what I am incapable of feeling ? '' 
Belinda 's eye was caught by an engraving of lady Delacour in the character of the comic muse . 
Mr. Vincent did not know the intimacy that had subsisted between her ladyship and miss Portman -- She sighed from the recollection of Clarence Hervey , and of all that had passed at the masquerade . 
-- Compare their pictures : -- compare their characters : -- compare -- '' `` Excuse me , '' interrupted Belinda ; `` lady Delacour was once my friend , and I do not like to make a comparison so much to her disadvantage . 
Mr. Vincent 's voice faltered in pronouncing the word love ; yet Belinda , prepossessed by the idea that he was attached to some creole lady , simply answered , without looking up from her drawing , `` You are indeed very fortunate , peculiarly fortunate . 
`` Surely , miss Portman can not imagine that I am at this instant thinking of any West-Indian lady ! '' 
Belinda looked up with an air of surprise . 
-- `` Charming miss Portman ! '' 
Miss Portman had been too often called `` charming , '' to be much startled or delighted by the sound ; the word would have passed by unnoticed , but there was something so impassioned in Mr. Vincent 's manner , that she could no longer mistake it for common gallantry , and she was in evident confusion . 
-- Now for the first time the idea of Mr. Vincent as a lover came into her mind . 
The next instant she accused herself of vanity , and dreaded that he should read her thoughts . 
said she in a tone of raillery . 
-- Mine is not the cold hackneyed phrase of gallantry , but the fervid language of passion , '' cried he , seizing her hand . 
At this instant one of the children came in with some flowers for Belinda ; and glad of the interruption , she hastily put up her drawings and left the room , observing that she should scarcely have time to dress before dinner . 
-- However , as soon as she found herself alone , she forgot how late it was ; and though she sat down before the glass to dress , she made no progress in the business , but continued for some time motionless , endeavouring to recollect and to understand all that had passed . 
The result of her reflections was the conviction , that her partiality for Clarence Hervey was greater , than she had ever till this moment suspected . 
Before Belinda had answered these questions to her satisfaction , the dinnerbell rang . 
The children were delighted at the sight , and little Charles insisted upon Belinda 's following him to a particular spot , where he was well convinced that she could see better than any where else in the world . 
-- Belinda coloured at hearing unexpectedly the name of the person of whom she was at that instant thinking , and the child continued -- `` I liked that Mr. Hervey very much -- I liked him from the first day I saw him . 
Did you ever see him , miss Portman ? 
-- This simple question threw Belinda into inexpressible confusion ; but fortunately the crimson on her face was seen only by lady Anne Percival . 
`` No , my dear , it is called a banjore ; it is an African instrument , of which the negroes are particularly fond -- Mr. Vincent mentioned it the other day to miss Portman , and I believe she expressed some curiosity to see one . 
-- Poor fellow , I dare say that he was very sorry to go to Harrowgate , and to leave his African guitar half finished ; especially as it was intended for an offering to miss Portman . 
Belinda smiled at this parable of the rose-bud , which , she said , might be applied to men and women , as well as to children ; that the growth of the affections must be spontaneous . 
`` That is the very thing I meant to say , '' interrupted Belinda eagerly . 
`` Undoubtedly , '' said Belinda . 
Belinda was silent ; but after a pause she said , `` That it was certainly very dangerous , especially for women , to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections , And yet , '' continued she , `` it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society . 
said Belinda . 
`` True , '' said Belinda -LRB- who now suspected that lady Anne alluded to Mr. Vincent -RRB- : `` and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide , whether the man who addressed her would suit her taste or not ; so she would be inexcusable if , either from vanity or coquetry , she disguised her real sentiments . '' 
`` And will miss Portman , who can not by any one to whom she is known be suspected of vanity or coquetry , permit me to speak to her with the freedom of a friend ? '' 
Belinda , who was much touched by the kindness of lady Anne 's manner , pressed her hand , and exclaimed , `` Yes , dear lady Anne , speak to me with freedom , you can not do me a greater favour . 
One who , like miss Portman , has lived in the world , has seen a variety of characters , and probably has had a variety of admirers , must have formed some determinate idea of the sort of companion , that would make her happy , if she were to marry -- unless , '' said lady Anne , `` she has formed a resolution against marriage . '' 
`` I have formed no such resolution , '' said Belinda . 
`` I fear , my dear lady Anne , '' cried Belinda , `` that it is not in my power to return his affection . '' 
`` Mr. Vincent appears to have an excellent understanding , '' said Belinda . 
`` He is remarkably handsome , he is well bred , and his manners are perfectly unaffected , '' said Belinda , `` but -- do not accuse me of caprice -- altogether he does not suit my taste ; and I can not think it sufficient not to feel disgust for a husband -- though I believe this is the fashionable doctrine . '' 
You have too good an opinion of me -- my mind is not so well regulated -- I am much weaker , much sillier , than you imagine -- than you can conceive , '' said Belinda . 
`` Will he not do what is most prudent to avoid the charming miss Portman , '' said lady Anne smiling , `` if he must not love her ? 
Nothing but the assurance that the heart is engaged can be a sufficient cause for despair ; nothing else could , in my eyes , justify you , my dear Belinda , from the charge of caprice . '' 
`` I can give you no such assurance , I hope -- I believe , '' said Belinda in great confusion ; `` and yet I would not for the world deceive you ; you have a right to my sincerity . '' 
She paused ; and lady Anne said with a smile , `` Perhaps I can spare you the trouble of telling me in words what a blush told me , or at least made me suspect , yesterday evening , when we were standing by the river-side , when little Charles asked you -- '' `` Yes . 
Belinda gave a full account of her acquaintance with Clarence Hervey ; of the variations in his manner towards her ; of his excellent conduct with respect to lady Delacour -LRB- of this , by the by , she spoke at large -RRB- . 
Lady Anne had a high opinion of Mr. Hervey ; but she had no doubt , from Belinda 's account , and from her own observations on Mr. Hervey , and from slight circumstances which had accidentally come to Mr. Percival 's knowledge , that he was , as Belinda suspected , attached to Virginia St. Pierre . 
She wished , therefore , to confirm miss Portman in this belief , and to turn her thoughts towards one who , beside being deserving of her esteem and love , felt for her the most sincere affection . 
She did not , however , press the subject farther at this time , but contented herself with requesting , that Belinda would take three days -LRB- the usual time given for deliberation in fairy tales -RRB- before she should decide against Mr. Vincent . 
Lady Anne was pleased to see them comfortably settled in their new habitation ; and whilst she and Belinda were talking to the old couple , their grandaughter , a pretty-looking girl of about eighteen , came in with a basket of eggs in her hand . 
And she hurried out of the cottage with Belinda , apprehensive that the talkative old dame might weaken the effect of her good sense and experience by a further profusion of words . 
`` One would think , '' said Belinda with an ingenuous smile , `` that this lesson upon the dangers of fancy was intended for me : at any rate , I may turn it to my own advantage . '' 
They walked on in silence for a few minutes ; and then miss Portman , pursuing the train of her own thoughts , and unconscious that she had not explained them to lady Anne , abruptly exclaimed , `` But if I should be entangled , so as not to be able to retract ! 
`` And yet , notwithstanding you are so well aware of the danger , your ladyship would expose me to it , '' said Belinda . 
In London if you and Mr. Vincent were seen often in each other 's company , it would be immediately buzzed about , that miss Portman and Mr. Vincent were going to be married ; and if the match did not take place , a thousand foolish stories might be told to account for it 's being broken off . 
Lady Anne 's arguments and raillery had such an effect upon miss Portman , that no writ of banishment was issued against Mr. Vincent . 
He returned to Oakly-park -- but upon the express condition , that he should not make his attachment public by any particular attentions , and that he should draw no conclusions in his favour from Belinda 's consenting to converse with him freely upon every common subject . 
Belinda and Mr. Vincent could never agree in their definition of the word flattery ; so that there were continual complaints on the one hand of a breach of treaty , and , on the other , solemn protestations of the most scrupulous adherence to his compact . 
One evening , Belinda was playing with little Charles Percival at jackstraws . 
Mr. Vincent , who found pleasure in every thing which amused Belinda , and Mr. Percival , who took an interest in every thing which entertained his children , were looking on at this simple game . 
`` Mr. Percival , '' said Belinda , `` condescending to look at a game of jackstraws ! '' 
miss Portman , take care ! '' 
`` I would lay a hundred guineas upon the steadiness of miss Portman 's hand , '' cried Mr. Vincent . 
`` I 'll lay you sixpence though , '' cried Charles eagerly , `` that she 'll stir the king , if she touches that knave -- I 'll lay you a shilling . '' 
`` I am sure you are in the right now , '' said Mr. Percival ; `` and , what is better than my saying so , miss Portman thinks so , as her smile tells me . '' 
`` You moved , miss Portman ! '' 
O miss Portman ! 
`` By the by , '' cried Mr. Vincent , `` miss Portman has never seen those wonderful rocking stones -- Suppose we were to ride to see them to morrow ? '' 
The next morning was neither too hot nor too cold , and they set out on their little party of pleasure : the children went with their mother , to their great delight , in the sociable ; and Mr. Vincent , to his great delight , rode with Belinda . 
`` I fancy it has got up of itself , '' said Belinda , `` for it seems to be getting down of itself . 
`` No , surely , '' said Belinda : '' It can not be a woman ! '' 
As they rode nearer to the scene of action , Belinda heard the shrill screams of a female voice , and they descried amongst the gentlemen a slight figure in a riding-habit . 
cried Belinda . 
`` We had better keep out of the way , I think , '' said Belinda ; `` for perhaps , as she has vowed vengeance against me , she might take a fancy to setting me upon that pinnacle of glory . '' 
-- But I will not run into danger on purpose to give you the pleasure of defending me , '' said Belinda ; and as she spoke , she turned her horse another way . 
`` You wo n't turn back , miss Portman ? '' 
cried Vincent eagerly , laying his hand on her bridle . 
`` Certainly , '' said Mr. Percival : `` miss Portman shows her usual prudence . '' 
`` The children are so good tempered , that I am sure they will forgive me , '' continued Belinda ; `` and Mr. Vincent will be ashamed not to follow their example , though he seems to be rather angry with me at present for obliging him to turn back -- out of the path of danger . '' 
`` You need not alarm yourself : miss Portman does not seem inclined to put you to the trial , you see , '' said Mr. Percival , smiling . 
`` Now it is really to be regretted , that she deprived you of an opportunity of fighting some of the gentlemen in Mrs. Freke 's train , or of delivering her from the perilous height of one of those rocking stones . 
said Belinda . 
said Belinda . 
`` Mrs. Freke , notwithstanding the blustering merriment that she affects , is obviously unhappy , '' said Belinda ; `` and since we can not do her any good , either by our blame or our pity , we had better think of something else . '' 
`` Scandal , '' said Mr. Vincent , `` does not seem to give you much pleasure , miss Portman . 
`` Nobody more likely to do a generous action than Mr. Hervey , '' repeated Belinda in rather a lower tone . 
She could now praise Clarence Hervey without blushing , and she could think even of his generosity without enthusiasm , though not without pleasure . 
By strength of mind , and timely exertion , she had prevented her prepossession from growing into a passion that might have made her miserable . 
Proud of this conquest over herself , she was now disposed to treat Mr. Vincent with more favour than usual . 
`` You and miss Portman have taught me better sense . 
Belinda coloured also . 
Mr. Percival appeared to be unconscious , that what he was saying was any way applicable to Belinda . 
He addressed himself to Mr. Vincent solely , and she listened at her ease . 
`` But , '' said she , `` do not you think that this prejudice , as I am willing to allow it to be , in favour of first loves , may in our sex be advantageous ? 
`` Delicacy , my dear miss Portman , is a charming word , and a still more charming thing , and Mrs. Freke has probably increased our affection for it ; but even delicacy , like all other virtues , must be judged by the test of utility . 
`` I acknowledge this would not add to the happiness of society , '' said Belinda . 
If I have spoken too long or too warmly upon the chapter of first loves , I have at least been a perfectly disinterested declaimer ; for I can assure you , miss Portman , that I do not suspect lady Anne Percival of sighing in secret for some vision of perfection , any more than she suspects me of pining for the charming lady Delacour , who , perhaps , you may have heard was my first love . 
`` I hear , '' said Belinda smiling , `` I hear and understand the emphasis , with which you pronounce that word delicacy . 
-- Though Belinda had never mentioned to Mr. Vincent the name of Clarence Hervey till this day ; and though he did not in the least suspect from her manner , that this gentleman ever possessed any interest in her heart ; yet with her accustomed sincerity she had confessed to him , that an impression had been made upon her mind before she came to Oakly-park . 
After this conversation with Mr. Percival , Mr. Vincent perceived that he gained ground more rapidly in her favour ; she became accustomed to consider him as a lover , and his company grew every day more agreeable to her taste ; he was convinced that , as he possessed her esteem , he should in time secure her affections . 
One fine morning lady Anne Percival came into Belinda 's room with a bridal favour in her hand -- `` Do you know , '' said she , `` that we are to have a wedding to day . 
-- Belinda heard from all sides praises of Mr. Vincent 's generosity ; and she could not be insensible to the simple but enthusiastic testimony , which Juba bore to his master 's goodness . 
In some of the stanzas , Belinda could distinguish that her own name was frequently repeated . 
They were a mixture of English and of his native language ; they described in the strongest manner what had been his feelings , whilst he was under the terrour of Mrs. Freke 's fiery obeah woman , then his joy on being relieved from these horrours , with the delightful sensations of returning health ; -- and thence he suddenly passed to his gratitude to Belinda , the person to whom he owed his recovery . 
He concluded with wishing her all sorts of happiness , and , above all , that she might be fortunate in her love ; which Juba thought the highest degree of felicity . 
He had no sooner finished his song , which particularly touched and pleased miss Portman , than he begged his master to offer to her the little instrument , which he had made with much pains and ingenuity . 
She accepted the banjore with a smile that enchanted Mr. Vincent ; but at this instant they were startled by the sound of a carriage driving rapidly into the park . 
Belinda looked up , and between the heads of the dancers she just caught a glimpse of a well-known livery . 
she exclaimed , `` lady Delacour 's carriage ! 
Belinda pressed forward to meet her ; poor Marriott was in great agitation : -- `` Oh , miss Portman ! 
Dear miss Portman , I hope you wo n't refuse to come ? 
Miss Portman immediately accompanied Marriott towards the house ; and as they walked thither , she learned that lady Delacour had applied to the quack in whom she had such implicit faith , and had in vain endeavoured to engage him to perform for her the operation , to which she had determined to submit . 
He was afraid to hazard it , and he prevailed upon her to give up the scheme , and to try some new external remedy from which he promised wonders . 
No one knew what his medicines were , but they affected her head in the most alarming manner . 
In her delirium she called frequently upon miss Portman , sometimes accusing her of the basest treachery , sometimes addressing her as if she were present , and pouring forth the warmest expressions of friendship . 
`` When I am in my grave , Marriott , '' cried my lady , ` it will be time enough for miss Portman again to visit this house , and you may then express your attachment to her with more propriety than at present . ' 
So I put together things about miss Portman and my lord , that had dropped at odd times from sir Philip Baddely 's gentleman ; and I , partly serious and partly flirting , which in a good cause is no sin , drew from him -LRB- for he pretends to be a little an admirer of mine , ma'am , though I never gave him the smallest encouragement -RRB- all he knew or suspected , or had heard reported , or whispered : -- and out it came , ma'am , that Mr. Champfort was the original of all ; and that he had told a heap of lies about some bank-notes that my lord had given you , and that you and my lord were to be married as soon as my lady was dead ; and I do n't know what , which he maliciously circulated through sir Philip 's gentleman to sir Philip himself , and so round again to my lady . 
So , ma'am , when Mr. Champfort was thrown off his guard by the claret , sir Philip 's gentleman began to talk of my lord and my lady , and miss Portman ; and he observed that my lord and my lady were coming together more than they used to be since miss Portman left the house . 
It was to hinder this I got miss Portman banished ; for my lord was quite another man after she got miss Helena into the house ; and I do n't doubt but he might have been brought to leave off his Burgundy , and set up for a sober regular man ; which would not suit me at all . 
All this time she never mentioned your name , ma'am ; but once , when I was sitting by her bedside , as she was asleep , she started suddenly , and cried out , -- ` O , my dearest Belinda ! 
-- She wakened herself with the start ; and raising herself quite up in her bed , she pulled back the curtains , and looked all round the room . 
I 'm sure she expected to see you ; and when she found it was a dream , she gave a heavy sigh , and sunk down upon her pillow . 
` The best physician , my lord , she could send for , ' said I , ` would be miss Portman ; for she 'll never be well till that good young lady comes back again , in my humble opinion . ' 
As Marriott finished these words they reached the house , and Belinda went to her own room to read lady Delacour 's letter . 
It contained none of her customary ` éloquence du billet , ' no sprightly wit , no real , no affected gayety ; her mind seemed to be exhausted by bodily suffering , and her high spirit subdued . 
She expressed the most poignant anguish for having indulged such unjust suspicions and intemperate passions . 
She lamented having forfeited the esteem and affection of the only real friend she had ever possessed -- a friend of whose forbearance , tenderness , and fidelity , she had received such indisputable proofs . 
She concluded by saying , `` I feel my end fast approaching ; and perhaps , Belinda , your humanity will induce you to grant my last request , and to let me see you once more before I die . '' 
Belinda immediately decided to return to lady Delacour -- though it was with real regret that she thought of leaving lady Anne Percival , and the amiable and happy family to whom she had become so much attached . 
The children crowded round her when they heard that she was going , and Mr. Vincent stood in silent sorrow -- but we spare our readers this parting scene . 
Miss Portman promised to return to Oakly-park as soon as she possibly could . 
Mr. Vincent anxiously requested permission to follow her to town : but this she positively refused ; and he submitted with as good a grace as a lover can submit to any thing that crosses his passion . 
Aware that her remaining in town at such an unusual season of the year would appear unaccountable to her fashionable acquaintance , lady Delacour contrived for herself a characteristic excuse ; she declared that there was no possibility of finding pleasure in any thing but novelty , and that the greatest novelty to her would be to remain a whole summer in town . 
It was about noon when Belinda and Marriott arrived . 
cried her ladyship : `` miss Portman is not with you ? 
`` Miss Portman is come , my lady , '' said Marriott : `` she is in the dressing-room : she would not come in here with me , lest she should startle you . '' 
`` Belinda is come ! 
Admirable Belinda ! '' 
She put on an unusual quantity of rouge ; then looking at herself in the glass , she said with a forced smile -- `` Marriott , I look so charmingly , that miss Portman , perhaps , will be of lord Delacour 's opinion , and think that nothing is the matter with me . 
-- She has been behind the scenes , she knows the truth too well ! 
At the sight of Belinda she stopped short ; and , totally overpowered , she would have sunk upon the floor , had not miss Portman caught her in her arms , and supported her to a sofa . 
When she came to herself , and heard the soothing tone of Belinda 's voice , she looked up timidly in her face for a few moments without being able to speak . 
`` And are you really here once more , my dear Belinda ? '' 
cried she at last -- `` And may I still call you my friend ? 
`` My dear lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , `` you see all this in too strong a light -- you have done me no injury -- I have nothing to forgive . '' 
`` And now you have abused yourself till you are breathless , I may have some chance , '' said Belinda , `` of being heard in your defence . 
`` That indeed would admit of no excuse , '' said Belinda : `` therefore you will pardon me if I think it incredible -- especially as I have detected you in feeling something like affection for your little daughter , after you had done your best , I mean your worst , to make me believe that you were a monster of a mother . '' 
`` That could not always have been your ladyship 's opinion , '' said Belinda with an arch smile . 
no speeches , I beseech you , '' cried she , as he was beginning to speak to miss Portman . 
Miss Portman is here , thank Heaven , and her ! 
He maintained an obstinate silence , and a profound solemnity -- till at last , rising from table , he turned to miss Portman , and said , `` Of all the caprices of fine ladies , that which surprises me the most is the whim of keeping their beds without being sick . 
Now , miss Portman , you would hardly suppose that my lady Delacour , who has been so lively this morning , has kept her bed , as I am informed , a fortnight -- Is not this astonishing ? '' 
`` Prodigiously astonishing , that my lord Delacour , like all the rest of the world , should be liable to be deceived by appearances , '' cried her ladyship . 
His lordship , struck by the sudden change of her voice from gayety to gravity , fixed his eyes upon her , and returned to his seat . 
She paused -- then addressing herself to Belinda : -- `` My incomparable `` friend , '' said she , `` I will now give you a convincing proof of the unlimited power you have over my mind . 
My lord , miss Portman has persuaded me to the step , which I am now going to take . 
She has prevailed upon me to make a decisive trial of your prudence and kindness . 
She has determined me to throw myself on your mercy . '' 
repeated lord Delacour , and a confused idea , that she was now about to make a confession of the justice of some of his former suspicions , took possession of his mind : he looked aghast . 
`` I am going , my lord , to confide to you a secret of the utmost importance -- a secret which is known to but three people in the world , miss Portman , Marriott , and a man whose name I can not reveal to you . '' 
said he , breaking from her with agony expressed in his countenance . 
-- You knew him better than I did , miss Portman . 
cried Belinda , `` how can you trifle in this manner ? '' 
`` I meant not , '' said her ladyship , `` to trifle . 
He followed her . 
-- Belinda heard the boudoir door unlock . 
said lady Delacour to miss Portman . 
said Belinda : `` you may yet live for years to be the blessing and pride of his life . 
She paused , and looked up towards Heaven with an expression of fervent devotion , which Belinda had once , and but once before , seen in her countenance . 
Then , as if forgetful even that Belinda was present , she threw herself upon a sofa , and fell , or seemed to fall , into a profound reverie . 
She was roused by the entrance of Marriott , who came into the room to ask whether she would now take her laudanum . 
`` I thought I had taken it , '' said she in a feeble voice ; and as she raised her eyes and saw Belinda , she added , with a faint smile , `` Miss Portman , I believe , has been laudanum to me this morning : but even that will not do long , you see ; nothing will do for me now but this , '' and she stretched out her hand for the laudanum . 
`` Is not it shocking to think , '' continued she , after she had swallowed it , `` that in laudanum alone . 
She put her hand to her head , as if partly conscious of the confusion of her own ideas ; and ashamed that Belinda should witness it , she desired Marriott to assist her to rise , and to support her to her bed-chamber . 
She made a sign to miss Portman not to follow her . 
Belinda looked over them along with Marriott , and she was surprised to find that they had almost all methodistical titles . 
Several pages in other books of the same description miss Portman found marked with a pencil , with reiterated lines , which she knew to be her ladyship 's customary mode of distinguishing passages that she particularly liked . 
Some were highly oratorical , but most of them were of a mystical cast , and appeared to Belinda scarcely intelligible . 
She had reason to be astonished at meeting with such books in the dressing-room of a woman of lady Delacour 's character . 
She resolved to conceal this weakness , as in her gayer moments she thought it , from Belinda , from whose superiour strength of understanding she dreaded ridicule or contempt . 
Her experience of miss Portman 's gentleness and friendship might reasonably have prevented or dispelled such apprehensions ; but lady Delacour was governed by pride , by sentiment , by whim , by enthusiasm , by passion -- by any thing but reason . 
When she began to revive after her fit of languor , and had been refreshed by opium and sleep , she rang for Marriott , and inquired for Belinda . 
She was much provoked when Marriott , by way of proving to her that miss Portman could not have been tired of being left alone , told her , that she had been in the dressing room rummaging over the books . 
Miss Portman is not reading them still , I suppose ? 
Her ladyship appeared in good spirits when she saw Belinda again . 
Deceived by the levity of her manner , Belinda concluded that the marks of approbation in these books were ironical , and she thought no more of the matter ; for lady Delacour suddenly gave a new turn to the conversation by exclaiming , `` Now we talk of the height of human absurdity , what are we to think of Clarence Hervey ? '' 
said Belinda . 
Yes , he deserves it , believe me , if it were only for having written me these charming letters , '' said lady Delacour , opening a cabinet , and taking out a small packet of letters , which she put into Belinda 's hands . 
Here , my love , if you like description , '' continued her ladyship , opening one of the letters , `` here is a Radcliffean tour along the picturesque coasts of Dorset and Devonshire . 
said Belinda , without raising her eyes from the letter , or seeming to pay any attention to the latter part of lady Delacour 's speech , `` very good description , certainly ! '' 
Then here is sentiment for you , '' continued her ladyship , spreading another letter before Belinda ; `` a story of a Dorsetshire lady , who had the misfortune to be married to a man as unlike Mr. Percival , and as like lord Delacour , as possible ; and yet , O , wonderful ! 
In short , my dear Belinda , to finish my panegyric , as it has been said of some other epistles , if ever there were letters calculated to make you fall in love with the writer of them , these are they . '' 
`` Then , '' said miss Portman , folding up the letter which she was just going to read , `` I will not run the hazard of reading them . '' 
`` If ever I marry , '' said Belinda with a look of proud humility , `` I shall certainly marry to please myself , and not to provoke any body else -- and at all events I hope I shall never marry a stick . '' 
How did you know -- '' exclaimed Belinda . 
And do you think that Marriott could refrain from telling me , in her most triumphant tone , that ` miss Portman has not gone to Oakly-park for nothing ; that she has made a conquest of a Mr. Vincent , a West Indian , a ward , or lately a ward , of Mr. Percival 's , the handsomest man that ever was seen , and the richest , & c. & c. & c. ? ' 
In plain , unmetaphorical prose , then , can not you comprehend , my straightforward Belinda , that if you make Clarence Hervey heartily jealous , let the impediments to your union be what they may , he will acknowledge himself to be heartily in love with you ? 
cried lady Delacour , kissing her : `` all may yet turn out well -- Read those letters -- Take them to your room , read them , read them ; and depend upon it , my dearest Belinda ! 
`` You do not offend , but you misunderstand me , '' said Belinda . 
Then miss Portman gave lady Delacour a simple but full account of all that had passed at Oakly park relative to Mr. Vincent . 
She repeated the arguments by which lady Anne Percival had first prevailed upon her to admit of Mr. Vincent 's addresses . 
Belinda , recollecting the circumstances of her ladyship 's early history , reproached herself for having touched on this tender subject , yet at the same time she felt with increased force , at this moment , the justice of Mr. Percival 's observations ; for , evidently , the hold which this prejudice had kept in lady Delacour 's mind had materially injured her happiness , by making her neglect , after her marriage , all the means of content that were in her reach . 
Belinda resolved at some future moment , whenever she could with propriety and with effect , to suggest these reflections to lady Delacour , and in the mean time she was determined to turn them to her own advantage . 
The letters from Clarence Hervey she read at night when she retired to her own room ; and they certainly raised not only Belinda 's opinion of his talents , but her esteem for his character . 
She saw that he had , with great address , made use of the influence he possessed over lady Delacour , to turn her mind to every thing that could make her amiable , estimable , and happy -- she saw that Clarence , so far from attempting , for the sake of his own vanity , to retain his preeminence in her ladyship 's imagination , used , on the contrary , `` his utmost skill '' to turn the tide of her affections toward her husband and her daughter . 
In one of his letters , and but in one , he mentioned Belinda . 
He expressed great regret at hearing from lady Delacour , that her friend miss Portman was no longer with her . 
There was an air of much respect and some embarrassment in all he said of Belinda , but nothing like love . 
`` P.S. Is there any hope that your friend miss Portman may spend the winter in town ? '' 
Her love and gratitude to miss Portman interested her most warmly for her happiness , and she was persuaded that the most effectual way to secure it would be to promote her union with her first love . 
Beside these generous motives , she was , perhaps , a little influenced by jealousy of the superiour power , which lady Anne Percival had in so short a time acquired over Belinda 's mind . 
`` Strange , '' thought she , `` if love and I be not a match for lady Anne Percival and reason ! '' 
Belinda Portman has this day returned to me from Oaklypark , fresh , blooming , wise , and gay , as country air , flattery , philosophy , and love , can make her . 
It seems that she has had full employment for her head and heart . 
As far as I can understand -- for I have not yet seen le futur -- he deserves my Belinda : for , beside being as handsome as any hero of romance , ancient or modern , he has a soul in which neither spot nor blemish can be found , except the amiable weakness of being desperately in love -- a weakness which we ladies are apt to prefer to the most philosophic stoicism . 
How they have contrived it I know not , but they have gained over Belinda 's mind a degree of power almost equal to parental authority . 
make haste and come back to us in time for Belinda 's wedding -- and do not forget my commission about the Dorsetshire angel ; bring me one in your right hand with a gold ring upon her taper finger -- So help you Cupid ! 
When miss Portman returned the packet of Mr. Hervey 's letters , her ladyship was dissatisfied with the measured terms of Belinda 's approbation , and she said with a sarcastic smile , `` So , they have made a complete philosopher of you at Oakly-park ! 
`` Rather to be lighted there , if possible , '' said Belinda ; and she endeavoured to turn the conversation to what she thought must be more immediately interesting to lady Delacour -- her own health . 
`` I believe you , my generous Belinda ! '' 
-- Rantipole , my dear , '' continued lady Delacour , turning to miss Portman , `` is the name of Harriet Freke 's villa in Kent . 
Thank you , my dear miss Portman , '' said her ladyship , as Belinda rose to take the letters from her hand . 
Whilst his lordship applied himself to trimming the lamp with great earnestness , lady Delacour negligently walked away to the farthest end of the room , where stood the cabinet , which Belinda was trying to unlock . 
whispered Belinda , holding her hand as she gave her the key , `` I never can love or esteem you , if you use lord Delacour ill now . '' 
This lock is spoilt , I do believe , '' said she aloud . 
`` And can you think him a fool , '' pursued Belinda in a still more earnest whisper , `` for being more jealous of your mind than of your person ? 
said her ladyship ; then turning to lord Delacour , `` My lord , will you come here and tell us what can be the matter with this lock ? '' 
`` But you will not desert us at our utmost need , I am sure , my lord , '' said Belinda , approaching him with a conciliatory smile . 
`` You want the light , I believe , more than I do , '' said his lordship , advancing with the lamp to meet her . 
`` Miss Portman will think us both a couple of old fools , '' said her ladyship , making a slight effort to withdraw her hand . 
`` But she is almost as great a simpleton herself , I think , '' continued she , observing that the tears stood in Belinda 's eyes . 
`` Miss Portman will be famished amongst us . 
You must give us some music , my good Belinda , and make him accompany you with his flute . 
With the assistance of Belinda 's portfolio and her harp , and the good humour and sprightliness of lady Delacour 's wit , his lordship got through the evening much to his own satisfaction . 
He played on the flute , he told the story of Studley 's original Titian , and he detected a fault that had escaped Mr. Percival in the perspective of miss Portman 's sketch of Fountain 's Abbey . 
Whilst they were at breakfast the next morning in lady Delacour 's dressing-room , Marriott knocked at the door , and , immediately opening it , exclaimed in a joyful tone , `` Miss Portman , they 're eating it ! 
`` Bring them in ; your lady will give you leave , Marriott , I fancy , '' said miss Portman . 
`` See , my lady , '' said she , `` what miss Portman has been so good to bring from Oakly-park for my poor gold fish , who , I am sure , ought to be much obliged to her , as well as myself . '' 
`` This , '' replied Belinda , `` is what ` Th ' unlearned , duckweed ; learned , lemma , call , ' and it is to be found in any ditch or standing pool . '' 
`` To oblige little Charles Percival , '' said miss Portman . 
She found out in some book that she was reading with him last summer , that gold fishes are fond of this plant ; and I wish , '' added Belinda in a timid voice , `` that she were here at this instant to see them eat it ! '' 
`` But now I am here , '' said Belinda , `` will she be any trouble to you ? 
Belinda , who had been used to the variations of lady Delacour 's spirits , was not much alarmed by the despondent strain in which she now spoke , especially when she considered that the thoughts of the dreadful trial this unfortunate woman was soon to go through must naturally depress her courage . 
Rejoiced at the permission that she had obtained to go for Helena , miss Portman sent immediately to lady Boucher , who took her to Sloane-street . 
`` Now , my dear considerate miss Portman , '' said lady Boucher , `` I must beg and request that you will hurry miss Delacour into the carriage as fast as possible . 
`` No , ma'am , I believe this name is Ellicott , '' said Belinda . 
`` Now , my dear considerate miss Portman , remember the auction , and do n't let miss Delacour stay to change her dress or any thing . '' 
Belinda promised not to detain her ladyship a minute . 
In the hall a crowd of children were gathered round a high stand , on which they were eagerly arranging their flower-pots , and the busy hum of voices was so loud , that , when miss Portman first went in , she could neither hear the servant , nor make him hear her name . 
The little crowd looked towards the hall-door ; and from the midst of her companions , Helena Delacour , who now caught a glimpse of Belinda , sprang forward , throwing down her white Provence rose as she passed . 
She was so much overjoyed , when she heard that Belinda was come by her mamma 's desire to take her home , that she would scarcely stay whilst Mrs. Dumont was tying on her straw hat , and exhorting her to let lady Delacour know how it happened that she was `` so far from fit to be seen . '' 
Dear miss Portman , will you speak for me ? 
Miss Portman desired the old man to call in Berkeley square at lady Delacour 's ; and this satisfying all parties , they drove away . 
Charles Percival 's little journal , which she had been reading , was left on the sofa , and Belinda gave it to Helena , who eagerly began to look over it . 
said she ; and she had almost finished reading it before her mother came into the room . 
-- You perceive some difference , for instance , between miss Portman 's colour and mine ? 
Helena 's colour rose to her temples ; but , with a firmness that surprised even Belinda , she repeated what she had said nearly in the same words . 
`` Do you understand her , miss Portman ? '' 
`` She expresses , I think , '' said Belinda , `` a very honourable sentiment , and one that is easily understood . '' 
`` Ay , in general , certainly , '' said lady Delacour , checking herself ; `` but I thought that she meant to allude to something in particular -- that was what I did not understand . 
Whilst they were looking at the gold fishes , the old man who had been desired by miss Portman to call , arrived . 
And Helena , who did not know the share which Belinda 's aunt and her own mother had in the transaction , began with great eagerness to tell the history of the poor gardener , who had been cheated by some fine ladies out of his aloe , & c . 
`` I received the money for him , and I was just going to pay him , '' said Helena , `` when miss Portman came ; and that put every thing else out of my head . 
I will break through the spell of dissipation -- I will at once cast off all the acquaintance that are unworthy of me -- I will , in one word , go with you , my dear Belinda ! 
Though Belinda could not entirely enter into those feelings , which thus made lady Delacour invent wit against herself , and anticipate caricaturas ; yet she did every thing in her power to calm her ladyship 's apprehensions of a discovery . 
You are too young , too innocent , to hear the particulars of my history now ; but you will hear them all at a proper time from my best friend miss Portman . 
I shall leave you to her care , my dear , when I die . '' 
If I die , Belinda will take you with her immediately to Oakly-park -- you shall have as little sorrow as possible . 
The paper contained only some legacies to her servants , a provision for Marriott , and a bequest , to her excellent and beloved friend Belinda Portman , of the cabinet in which she kept Clarence Hervey 's letters . 
Interlined in this place , lady Delacour had written these words : `` My daughter is nobly provided for ; and lest any doubt or difficulty should arise from the omission , I think it necessary to mention that the said cabinet contains the valuable jewels left to me by my late uncle , and that it is my intention that the said jewels should be part of my bequest to the said Belinda Portman . 
-- If she marry a man of good fortune , she will wear them for my sake : if she do not marry an opulent husband , I hope she will sell the jewels without scruple , as they are intended for her convenience , and not as an ostentatious bequest . 
It is fit that she should be as independent in her circumstances , as she is in her mind . '' 
She spent nearly a week at Twickenham in this anxious state , and Belinda observed that she every day became more and more thoughtful and reserved . 
She seemed as if she had some secret subject of meditation , from which she could not bear to be distracted . 
`` I wish to Heaven , miss Portman ! '' 
When Belinda questioned Marriott more particularly about the strange hints which her lady had let fall , she with looks of embarrassment and horrour declined repeating the words that had been said to her ; yet persisted in asserting that lady Delacour had been very strange for these two or three days . 
The only circumstances that could be drawn from her , seemed to Belinda so trifling as to be scarcely worth mentioning . 
Now , miss Portman , to hear my lady talk of the moon , and moonlights , and liking the moon , is rather extraordinary and unaccountable ; for I never heard her say any thing of the sort in my life before ; I question whether she ever knew there was a moon or not from one year 's end to another . 
Belinda could not forbear smiling at this melancholy nonsense ; though she was inclined to be of Marriott 's opinion about the methodistical books , and she determined to talk to lady Delacour on the subject . 
At night , when they were retiring to rest , Marriott , as she lighted them to their rooms , observed that she was afraid her lady would suffer from sleeping in so , cold a bed-chamber , and Belinda pressed her friend to change her apartment . 
Belinda 's blood ran cold at the sight of them . 
`` Will you be so kind , miss Portman , '' said Marriott , `` as to let my lady know that they are come ? 
Miss Portman went to lady Delacour 's bed chamber . 
As she opened it , she fixed her eyes upon Belinda , and said to her with a mild voice , `` You are come to tell me that the surgeon is arrived . 
I will see him this moment , '' continued she in a firm tone ; and she deliberately put a mark in the book in which she had been reading , walked leisurely to the other end of the room , and locked it up in her book-case . 
There was an air of determined dignity in all her motions . 
I am ready , '' said she , holding out her hand to Belinda , who had sunk upon a chair . 
Listen to me , dearest Belinda ! 
`` No , '' said Belinda , `` Marriott is incapable of attending you . 
Lady Delacour made no answer , but walked on before her with steady steps into the room where doctor X -- and the surgeon were waiting . 
Without adverting in the least to the object of their visit , she paid her compliments to them , as if they came on a visit of mere civility . 
Without seeming to notice the serious countenances of her companions , she talked of indifferent subjects with the most perfect ease , occupying herself all the time with cleaning a seal , which she unhooked from her watch-chain . 
`` This seal , '' said she , turning to doctor X -- , `` is a fine ony x -- it is a head of Esculapius . 
It was given to me by your friend , Clarence Hervey ; and I have left it in my will , doctor , '' continued she smiling , `` to you , as no slight token of my regard . 
He is an excellent young man ; and I request , '' said she , drawing doctor X -- to a window , and lowering her voice , `` I request , when you see him again , and when I am out of the way , that you will tell him such were my sentiments to the hour of my death . 
He prevailed upon the surgeon to stay with her till the next morning ; and he communicated his intentions to Belinda , who joined with him in doing all that was possible to entertain and interest lady Delacour by conversation during the remainder of the day . 
Helena knew nothing of what had passed , and Belinda imagined that her friend put this constraint upon herself to avoid alarming her daughter . 
Belinda was persuaded that she only affected this gayety to prevent doctor X -- from insisting upon sitting up in her room , as he had proposed . 
DoctorX -- , judging , as he said , from her ladyship 's general character , attributed the whole to caprice ; and the surgeon , judging , as he said , from human nature in general , was decided in his belief that she had been influenced , as she herself declared , by cowardice . 
Belinda 's bed-chamber was next to Helena 's ; and after she had been in bed about an hour , she fancied that she heard some one walking softly in the next room . 
She started at the sight of Belinda , but only said in a low voice , as she pointed to her child , `` Do n't waken her . '' 
She then looked at her for some moments in silence . 
The moon shone full upon her face . 
She stooped over Helena , parted the ringlets of hair upon her forehead , and kissed her gently . 
`` You will be good to this poor girl when I am gone , Belinda ! '' 
said she , turning away from her as she spoke : `` I only came to look at her for the last time . '' 
Do n't waken her , '' said lady Delacour , putting her finger on her lips ; and , walking slowly out of the room , she forbade Belinda to follow . 
`` If my fears be vain , '' said she , `` why should I disturb you with them ? 
Belinda did not go to bed , but sat waiting and listening anxiously . 
The clock struck two ; and as she heard no other sound , she began to hope that she had suffered herself to be falsely alarmed by a foolish imagination , and she lay down upon her bed , resolving to compose herself to rest . 
She was just sinking to sleep , when she thought she heard the faint sound of a bell . 
She was not sure whether she was dreaming or awake . 
She started up and listened . 
Belinda flew to her room . 
Belinda , by his directions , ran immediately for doctor X -- , who was at the other end of the house . 
Before she returned lady Delacour had recovered her senses . 
She begged that the surgeon would leave the room , and that neither doctor X -- nor Marriott might yet be admitted , as she had something of importance to communicate to miss Portman . 
The surgeon withdrew , and she beckoned to Belinda , who sat down upon the side of her bed . 
cried Belinda : `` can you think me so cruel as to consider your sufferings as a subject for ridicule ? '' 
Lady Delacour was overcome by the tenderness with which Belinda spoke . 
`` I will then speak to you , '' said she , `` without reserve . 
`` These visions , '' said Belinda , `` are certainly the effects of opium . '' 
`` The forms that flit before my eyes when I am between sleeping and waking , '' said lady Delacour , `` I am willing to believe , are the effects of opium ; but , Belinda , it is impossible I should be convinced that my senses have deceived me with respect to what I have beheld when I have been as broad awake , and in as perfect possession of my understanding , as I am at this instant . 
`` Mrs. Marriott , you need not alarm yourself in this manner , '' said he : `` your lady is at this instant in as little danger as I am . '' 
-- Marriott , you may -- '' Belinda heard no more ; for at this instant , as she was standing alone , near the glass door that was opposite to the bed , she saw at a distance in the garden the figure which lady Delacour had described . 
Lady Delacour was now so intent upon speaking to Dr. X -- , that she saw nothing but him . 
Belinda had the presence of mind to be perfectly silent . 
She advanced a few steps nearer to the window , and the figure vanished . 
She kept her eye steadily fixed upon the spot where it had disappeared , and she saw it rise again and glide quickly behind some bushes . 
Belinda beckoned to Dr. X -- , who perceived , by the eagerness of her manner , that she wished to speak to him immediately . 
He resigned his patient to Marriott , and followed miss Portman out of the room . 
She told him what she had just seen , said that it was of the utmost consequence to lady Delacour to have the truth ascertained , requested that Dr. X -- would go with some of the men servants and search the garden , to discover whether any one was there concealed , or whether any footsteps could be traced . 
As they were carrying him across the hall , Belinda met them . 
She poured out a glass of water for the man , who was just recovering from his swoon ; but , as she went nearer to give it to him , she was struck with his wonderful resemblance to Harriot Freke . 
whispered she to Marriott , whose wide opening eyes , at this instant , fixed themselves upon her . 
Mrs. Freke was further informed , by the same unquestionable authority , that lady Delacour had taken a house at Twickenham , for the express purpose of meeting her lover ; that miss Portman and Marriott were the only persons who were to be of this party of pleasure . 
The desire of revenging herself upon miss Portman , for having declined her civilities at Harrowgate , had also a powerful influence in stimulating her malicious activity . 
She knew , that if it were proved that Belinda was the confidante of lady Delacour 's intrigues , her reputation must be materially injured , and that the Percivals would then be as desirous to break off , as they now were anxious to promote , the match with Mr. Vincent . 
The agony that she suffered was at first intense ; but in a few hours the pain , somewhat subsided ; and in this interval of rest she turned to Belinda , and with a malicious smile said , -- `` Miss Portman , 't is fair I should pay for my peeping ; but I shall not pay quite so dear for it as some of my friends . '' 
Miss Portman did not in the least comprehend her , till she added , `` I 'm sure you 'll allow that 't is better for a lady to lose her leg , than her reputation -- and for my part , I 'd rather be caught in a man trap , than have a man caught in my bed-chamber . 
-- Notwithstanding all my visions I have outlived the night , you see , '' said lady Delacour to miss Portman when they met in the morning . 
`` I have heard , my dear Belinda , and I believe , that the passion of love , which can endure caprice , vice , wrinkles , deformity , poverty , nay disease itself , is notwithstanding so squeamish as to be instantaneously disgusted by the perception of folly in the object beloved . 
My fortitude shall redeem me in your opinion , Belinda , and in my own . '' 
`` Why did not you or miss Portman write to me yesterday , as you promised ? '' 
Lord Delacour stood motionless for an instant ; then suddenly seizing his daughter 's hand , `` Let us go , '' said he : `` if we stay here we shall hear her screams ; '' and he was hurrying her away , when the door of lady Delacour 's apartment opened , and Belinda appeared , her countenance radiant with joy . 
And we may thank miss Portman for this , for 't was she made every thing go right , and I never expected to live to see so happy a day . '' 
said lord Delacour and Belinda almost in the same breath . 
-- Why , if lady Delacour were to wash off her rouge , and lay aside her airs , and be as gentle , good , and kind as Belinda Portman , for instance , her lord would certainly say to her , `` So altered are your face and mind , Twere perjury to love you now . '' 
One morning lady Delacour was complaining to Belinda that the books in the library were in dreadful confusion . 
said Belinda , `` the gentleman of whom Mr. Percival spoke , Mrs. Freke 's Mr. Moreton ? '' 
Animated with the new feelings of returning health , and the new hopes of domestic happiness , she seemed desirous to impart her felicity to all around her , but chiefly to Belinda , who had the strongest claims upon her gratitude , and the warmest place in her affections . 
Belinda never made her friend feel the weight of any obligation , and consequently lady Delacour 's gratitude was a voluntary pleasure -- not an expected duty . 
Nothing could be more delightful to miss Portman than thus to feel herself the object at once of esteem , affection , and respect ; to see that she had not only been the means of saving her friend 's life , but that the influence she had obtained over her mind was likely to be so permanently beneficial to her family and to herself . 
Belinda did not take all the merit of this reformation to herself : she was most willing to share it in her own imagination not only with doctor X -- and Mr. Moreton , but with poor Clarence Hervey . 
She was pleased to observe that lady Delacour never omitted any occasion of doing justice to his merit , and she loved her for that generosity , which sometimes passed the bounds of justice in her eulogiums . 
But Belinda was careful to preserve her consistency , and to guard her heart from the dangerous effect of these enthusiastic praises ; and as lady Delacour was now sufficiently reestablished in her health , she announced her intention of returning immediately to Oaklypark , according to her promise to lady Anne Percival and to Mr. Vincent . 
`` You expect , I know , '' said miss Portman ingenuously , `` that before the end of that time Mr. Hervey will be here . '' 
`` By the statutes of Oakly-park nothing is forbidden , '' said Belinda , `` but what reason -- '' `` Reason ! 
`` I am sufficiently aware , '' said Belinda , smiling , `` of the power of Cupid and of his wiles . 
Moved by the earnest manner in which Belinda uttered these words , lady Delacour rallied her no more , nor did she longer oppose her resolution of returning immediately to Oakly-park . 
`` May I remind you , '' said miss Portman , -- `` though it is seldom either politic or polite to remind people of their promises , -- but may I remind you of something like a promise you made to accompany me to Mr. Percival 's ? '' 
`` Lord Delacour is included in this invitation , '' said miss Portman , putting the last letter that she had received from lady Anne Percival into her hands . 
So , my dear Belinda , prevail upon lord Delacour to spend his Christmas at Oakly-park instead of at Studley-manor -LRB- Rantipole , thank Heaven ! 
Belinda was convinced that , when lady Delacour had once tasted the pleasures of domestic life , she would not easily return to that dissipation which she had followed from habit , and into which she had first been driven by a mixture of vanity and despair . 
Lord Delacour 's intimacy with lord Studley was one of his chief inducements to that intemperance , which injured almost equally his constitution and his understanding : for some weeks past he had abstained from all excess , but Belinda was well aware , that , when the immediate motive of humanity to lady Delacour ceased to act upon him , he would probably return to his former habits , if he continued to visit his former associates . 
She was convinced , that his understanding was not so much below par , as she had once been taught to think it : she perceived also , that , since their reconciliation , lady Delacour was anxious to make him appear to advantage : whenever he said any thing that was worth hearing she looked at Belinda with triumph ; and whenever he happened to make a mistake in conversation , she either showed involuntary signs of uneasiness , or passed it off with that easy wit , by which she generally knew how to make the worse appear the better reason . 
Miss Portman knew , that Mr. Percival possessed the happy talent of drawing out all the abilities of those with whom he conversed , and that he did not value men merely for their erudition , science , or literature ; he was capable of estimating the potential , as well as the actual range of the mind . 
Of his generosity she could not doubt , and she was persuaded that he would take every possible means , which good nature , joined to good sense , could suggest , to raise lord Delacour in his lady 's esteem , and to make that union happy , which was indissoluble . 
All these reflections passed with the utmost rapidity in Belinda 's mind , and the result of them was , that she consented to wait lady Delacour 's leisure for her journey . 
-- for I 'm sure , it 's a thing that goes quite against me to tell ; for I thought , indeed , my lady , superiorly of the person in question ; so much so , indeed , that I wished , what , I declare , I should now be ashamed to mention , especially in the presence of miss Portman , who deserves the best that this world can afford of every denomination . 
Well , ma'am , in one word , '' continued she , addressing herself to Belinda , `` I am extremely rejoiced , that things are as they are ; though , I confess , that was not always my wish or opinion , for which I beg Mr. Vincent 's pardon and yours ; but I hope to be forgiven , since I 'm now come entirely round to my lady Anne Percival 's way of thinking , which I learnt , from good authority , at Oakly-park ; and I am now convinced , and confident , miss Portman , that every thing is for the best . '' 
`` Marriott will inform us , in due course of time , what has thus suddenly and happily converted her , '' said lady Delacour to Belinda , who was thrown into some surprise and confusion by Marriott 's address but Marriott went on with much warmth -- `` Dear me ! 
`` We must take patience , my dear Belinda , '' said lady Delacour , calmly , `` till Marriott has exhausted all the expletives in and out of the English language ; and presently , when she has fought all her battles with Champfort over again , we may hope to get at the fact . '' 
Taking it for granted , that Belinda blushed , though in fact she did not , her ladyship , with superfluous address , instantly turned , so as to hide her friend 's face from Mrs. Marriott . 
my lady , something you 'll be surprised to hear , and miss Portman too . 
But no one , that has lived in the world , thinks any thing of that ; except , '' added she , catching a glimpse of Belinda 's countenance , -- `` except , to be sure , ma'am , morally speaking , it 's very wicked and shocking , and makes one blush before company , till one 's used to it , and ought certainly to be put down by act of parliament , ma'am ; but , my lady , you know , in point of surprising any body , or being discreditable in a young gentleman of Mr. Hervey 's fortune and pretensions , it would be mere envy and scandal , to deem it any thing -- worth mentioning . '' 
`` Well , my lady , you must know , then , that yesterday I wanted some hempseed for my bullfinch -- miss Helena 's bullfinch , I mean ; for it was she found it by accident , you know , miss Portman , the day after we came here ; poor thing , it got itself so entangled in the net over the morello cherry tree , in the garden , that it could neither get itself in nor out ; but very luckily , miss Helena saw it , and saved , and brought it in : it was almost dead , my lady . '' 
repeated lady Delacour , looking eagerly at Belinda ; `` was not that the name sir Philip Baddely mentioned to us -- you remember ? '' 
-- `` Yes ; Ormond was the name , as well as I recollect , '' said Belinda , with a degree of steady composure , that provoked her ladyship . 
I made the young woman describe him , for she had often and often seen him , when he visited the unfortunate creature ; and the description could suit none but our Mr. Hervey ; and besides , it put it beyond a doubt , she told me his linen was all marked C. H. -- So our Mr. Hervey , ma'am ; '' added Marriott , turning to Belinda , `` it certainly proved to be , to my utter dismay and confusion . '' 
Whilst Marriot went to fetch it , lady Delacour thought that Belinda would have time to recover from that utter dismay and confusion , into which she hoped that she must now be thrown . 
Her ladyship was again disappointed , when she examined Belinda 's countenance . 
-- Belinda sighed -- Marriott echoed the sigh , and continued : `` She was by herself , and in tears , when I was shown in , ma'am , and she started as if she had never seen any body before in her life . 
`` I always thought , that Marriott had a great deal of true spirit and feeling , '' said Belinda . 
Lady Delacour once more turned her quick eyes upon Belinda , and was much disappointed to see , by her countenance , that she approved of Marriott 's philosophy , even more than she sympathised in her indignation . 
`` But , '' interrupted miss Portman , `` I am not called upon to judge of Mr. Hervey 's whole conduct and character , nor of any part of it ; his letters and his generosity are nothing -- '' `` To you ? '' 
`` This is no time , and no subject for raillery , my dear friend , '' said Belinda ; `` you assured me , and I believed you , that the idea of Mr. Hervey 's return was entirely out of the question , when you prevailed upon me to delay my journey to Oakly park . 
As I now understand , that your ladyship has changed your mind , I must request your ladyship will permit me -- '' `` I will permit you to do what you please , dearest Belinda , except to call me your ladyship , twice in one minute . 
I have done with raillery -- my first , my only , object is your happiness -- I respect and esteem as much as I love you , and I love you better than any thing upon earth -- power excepted , you will say -- power not excepted , believe me ; and , if you are one of those strange people , that can not believe without proof , you shall have proof positive upon the spot , '' added she , ringing the bell as she spoke . 
`` So am I , '' said Belinda , with a smile . 
Scarcely had Belinda pronounced these words , when lord Delacour , who had dined in town , entered the room , accompanied by Mr. Vincent . 
`` ll à infiniment l'air d'un heros , de roman , '' thought she , and Belinda is not quite to great a philosopher as I imagined . 
In due time her ladyship recollected , that she had orders to give to Marriott about her journey , that made it absolutely necessary she should leave miss Portman to entertain Mr. Vincent , `` if possible , without her , '' for a few minutes ; and lord Delacour departed , contenting himself with the usual excuse of -- letters to write . 
`` I ought to be delighted with your gallantry , Mr. Vincent , '' said Belinda , `` in travelling so many miles , to remind me of my promise about Oakly-park ; but , on the contrary , I am sorry you have taken so much unnecessary trouble : lady Delacour is , at this instant , preparing for our journey to Mr. Percival 's . 
-- But come , '' said Belinda , `` tell me , seriously , the real motive of your visit ; for I see , that something passes in your mind , which you have not told me . '' 
`` Nothing , dear Belinda , is so agreeable to me as perfect openness and sincerity . 
Mr. Vincent put into her hands the following anonymous letter . 
The name of Clarence Hervey , in the last page , caught Belinda 's eye ; and with a trepidation , which she did not feel at the beginning of this epistle , she read the conclusion . 
As soon as Belinda had finished this curious production , she gave her hand to Mr. Vincent , with more kindness than she had ever before shown him . 
Careless of all that concerned herself , she explained , without a moment 's hesitation , every thing that could exalt Belinda : she described all the difficult circumstances , in which her friend had been placed ; she mentioned the secret , with which she had been entrusted ; the honour with which , even at the hazard of her own reputation , she had kept her promise of secresy inviolable , when lord Delacour , in a fit of intoxication and jealousy , had endeavoured to wrest from Marriott the key of the mysterious boudoir . 
`` The temper , the dignity , the gentleness , the humanity , with which Belinda bore with me , during this paroxysm of madness , '' said lady Delacour , `` I never can forget ; nor the spirit with which she left my house , when she saw me unworthy of her esteem , and ungrateful for her kindness ; nor the magnanimity with which she returned to me , when I thought myself upon my deathbed : all this has made an impression upon my soul , which never , whilst I have life and reason , can be effaced . 
She has saved my life . 
She has made my life worth saving . 
She has made me feel my own value . 
She has made me know my own happiness . 
She has reconciled me to my husband . 
She has united me with my child . 
She has been my guardian angel . 
-- She , the confidante of my intrigues ! 
-- she leagued with me in vice ! 
-- No , I am bound to her by ties stronger than vice ever felt ; than vice , even in the utmost ingenuity of it 's depravity , can devise . '' 
`` I have explained to Mr. Vincent , '' interrupted Belinda , `` every thing that he could wish to know , with respect to him . 
Mr. Vincent renewed his thanks to Belinda , and his protestations , that she was wasting her time , by endeavouring to make his assurance of her goodness ` doubly secure . ' 
`` You are a happier man than you yet know , Mr. Vincent , '' continued lady Delacour , `` for I can tell you , that some persuasion , some raillery , and some wit , I flatter myself , have been used , to detain miss Portman from you . '' 
`` From Oakly-park , '' interrupted Belinda . 
Start not at all , sir -- you have no reason ; for if he is mine , miss Portman is yours . 
I had reason to believe , that he has long admired the dignity of miss Portman 's mind , and the simplicity of her character , '' continued her ladyship , with an arch look at Belinda ; `` and though he was too much a man of genius , to begin with the present tense of the indicative mood , ` I love , ' yet I was , and am convinced , that he does love her . '' 
Can you , dear lady Delacour , '' cried Belinda , `` speak in this manner , and recollect all we heard from Marriott yesterday ? 
Mr. Hervey 's conduct towards miss Portman has , I acknowledge , sir , been undecided . 
`` Pardon me , '' interrupted lady Delacour ; `` there you are quite mistaken -- the man of Belinda 's choice must receive my congratulations -- he must do more -- he must become my friend . 
`` Really , my dear Belinda , '' said lady Delacour , when he was gone , `` I am not surprised at your impatience to return to Oakly-park ; I am not so partial to my knight , as to compare him , in personal accomplishments , with your hero . 
`` Not éperdument , I hope , '' said Belinda . 
`` I hope so , '' said Belinda , `` for we shall then agree perfectly . '' 
`` But not without loving him , '' said Belinda . 
`` I hope , and I believe , that I shall never have any reason to blush for loving him , '' said Belinda . 
`` Not of anger , '' said Belinda . 
`` It is a comparison that I never made , '' said Belinda . 
said Belinda . 
`` My belief in the reconciling power of custom does not go quite so far , '' said Belinda , laughing . 
You see , that I myself yield to my proper sovereign ; but the youthful Belinda should follow the enterprising standard of Novelty . '' 
`` If Novelty must at last abandon her conquests , it is surely prudent , '' said Belinda , `` to attach ourselves to the permanent victor . '' 
`` My dear Belinda , there can be no custom without previous novelty ; you therefore begin at the wrong end . '' 
Belinda sat down playfully at her piano-forte , and sang that beautiful french air , which concludes with , `` Un peu d'amour , un peu de soin , Menent souvent un coeur bien loin . '' 
she exclaimed , `` this must be the paper ; I mean , may be the paper , that Mr. Champfort was cutting a quire of , the very day before miss Portman left town . 
This lady was now suffering just punishment for her frolics , and lady Delacour thought her fallen so much below indignation , that she advised Belinda to take no manner of notice of her conduct , except simply returning the letter to her , with `` miss Portman 's , Mr. Vincent 's , and lord and lady Delacour 's compliments and thanks , to a sincere friend , who had been the means of bringing villainy to justice . '' 
He perceived the advantage , which he had gained with Belinda , and animated by fresh hope , he pressed his suit with all the ardour of his sanguine temper . 
The trunks were fastened upon the carriages , the imperial was carrying out , Marriott was full of a world of business , lord Delacour was looking at his horses as usual , Helena was patting Mr. Vincent 's great dog , and Belinda was rallying her lover , upon his taste for `` the pomp , pride , and circumstance '' of glorious travelling -- When an express arrived from Oakly-park . 
Mr. Vincent bore the disappointment as well as could be expected ; particularly , when Belinda observed , to comfort him , that `` the mind is it 's own place ; '' and that hers , she believed , would be the same at Twickenham as at Oakly-park . 
Nor did she give him any reason to doubt her steadiness , or to regret that she was not immediately under the influence of his own friends . 
The dread of being unduly biassed by lady Delacour , and the strong desire Belinda felt to act honourably by Mr. Vincent , to show him that she was not trifling with his happiness , and that she was incapable of the meanness of retaining a lover as a pis aller ; were motives , which acted more powerfully in his favour , than all that even lady Anne Percival could have looked or said . 
She was divided between her confidence in him , and her affection for Belinda ; unwilling to give him up , yet afraid to injure her happiness , or to offend her , by injudicious advice , and improper interference . 
One thing kept lady Delacour for some time in spirits -- miss Portman 's assurances , that she would not bind herself by any promise , or engagement , to Mr. Vincent , even when decided in his favour ; and that she should hold both him and herself perfectly free , till they were actually married . 
for at length , a consent -- blushing consent -- was given , to ratify the most solemn of all vows at the altar , and preparations were now going to be made for the marriage of Augustus Vincent and Belinda Portman . 
Lady Delacour recollected her own promise , to give her sincere congratulations to the victorious knight ; and she endeavoured to persuade Belinda and herself , that she was well satisfied with the approaching union ; she was , however , somewhat less disposed to like Mr. Vincent , from the discovery , which she accidentally made , of his being still upon good terms with odious Mrs. Luttridge . 
`` No doubt , '' said Belinda , smiling , `` since he belongs to you ; for you know , as Mr. Percival tells you , every thing , animate or inanimate , that is under your protection , you think , must be the best of it 's kind in the universe . '' 
`` Juba , the dog , or Juba , the man , '' said Belinda ? 
`` My dear lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , observing that she still retained an air of displeasure , `` I hope your antipathy to odious Mrs. Luttridge does not extend to every body who visits her . '' 
`` I 'll ask him the moment I see him , '' cried Belinda , `` if he is fond of play ; I know , he used to play at billiards at Oakly-park , but merely as an amusement . 
How I shall envy it you , my dear Belinda ! 
To make her peace with Mr. Vincent , and to drive the E O table from Belinda 's thoughts , her ladyship now turned the conversation from Juba , the dog , to Juba , the man . 
She talked of Harriot Freke 's phosphoric Obeah woman , of whom , she said , she had heard an account from miss Portman . 
She spoke of Juba 's marriage , and of his master 's generosity to him . 
From thence she went on to the African slave trade , by way of contrast , and she finished precisely where she had intended , and where Mr. Vincent could have wished , by praising a poem called ` The dying Negro , ' which he had , the preceding evening , brought to read to Belinda . 
Flattered by her present confirmation of his taste , Mr. Vincent readily complied with a request to read the poem to Belinda ; they were all deeply engaged by the charms of poetry , when they were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of -- Clarence Hervey ! 
Belinda 's colour rose , but her countenance maintained an expression of calm dignity . 
He seemed overpowered by the kindness , with which lady Delacour received him -- struck by the reserve of Belinda 's manner -- but not surprised , or displeased , at the sight of Mr. Vincent . 
`` Your ladyship must have thought me -- , '' and , as he spoke , his eye involuntarily glanced towards Belinda . 
`` Perhaps the appearance of virtue , '' said Belinda , `` might , on many occasions , succeed , as well as the reality . '' 
Belinda never raised her eyes whilst her ladyship uttered these words ; Mr. Vincent was , or seemed to be , so deeply engaged in looking for something in the book , which he held in his hand , that he could take no farther part in the conversation ; and a dead silence ensued . 
Lady Delacour , who was naturally impatient in the extreme , especially in the vindication of her friends , could not bear to see , as she did by Belinda 's countenance , that she had not forgotten Marriott 's story of Virginia St. Pierre ; and though her ladyship was convinced , that the packet would clear up all mysteries , yet she could not endure , that even in the interim ` poor Clarence ' should be unjustly suspected ; nor could she refrain from trying an expedient , which just occurred to her , to satisfy herself and every body present . 
Mr. Vincent is excusable , because he is in love ; and Belinda is excusable , because -- because -- Mr. Hervey , pray help me to an excuse for miss Portman 's stupidity , for I am dreadfully afraid of blundering out the truth . 
Mr. Hervey read these lines with so much unaffected , unembarrassed energy , that lady Delacour could not help casting a triumphant look at Belinda , which said , or seemed to say -- `` You see , I was right in my opinion of Clarence ! '' 
Belinda 's countenance openly expressed satisfaction ; it seemed to say -- `` I am glad , that Mr. Hervey is worthy of our esteem , though he can no longer have any claim to my love . '' 
Her manner toward him distinctly marked the same sentiment . 
That reserve , which had been retained , as long as she had any suspicion of his having acted dishonourably , was now dissipated , and she addressed her conversation to him with that easy , friendly familiarity , which a man of his discernment could not misunderstand . 
Had Mr. Vincent been left to his own observations , he would have seen the truth ; but he was alarmed and deceived by lady Delacour 's imprudent expressions of joy , and by the significant looks , that she gave her friend , miss Portman , which seemed to be looks of mutual intelligence . 
I do not forget it , I assure you -- I own you as my knight to all the world , in public and private -- do not I , Belinda ? '' 
A dark cloud overspread Mr. Vincent 's brow -- he listened not to Belinda 's answer . 
Seized with a transport of jealousy , he darted at Mr. Hervey a glance of mingled scorn and rage ; and , after saying a few unintelligible words to miss Portman and lady Delacour , he left the room . 
Clarence Hervey , who seemed afraid to trust himself longer with Belinda , withdrew a few minutes afterward . 
`` My dear Belinda ! '' 
repeated the dowager -- `` Yes ; and no secret , I promise you , lady Delacour : '' -- and then , turning to Belinda , she began a congratulatory speech , upon the report of her approaching marriage with Mr. Vincent . 
-- `` I distress you , I see , and it 's quite out of rule , I am sensible , to speak in this sort of way , miss Portman ; but , as I 'm an old acquaintance , and an old friend , and an old woman , you 'll excuse me . 
-- A charming young man , I hear , lady Delacour : I see , I must only speak to you , or I shall make miss Portman sink to the centre of the Earth , which I would not wish to do , especially at such a critical moment as this . 
I hear , with a noble West Indian fortune , and a noble spirit , and well connected , and passionately in love -- no wonder -- But I have done now , I promise you ; I 'll ask no questions -- so , do n't run away , miss Portman ; I 'll ask no questions , I promise you . '' 
I have one secret worth knowing , I can tell your ladyship -- and one , your ladyship and miss Portman , I 'm sure , will be rejoiced to hear . 
miss Portman , that was looked upon so completely , you know , as not a marrying man ; and now the last man upon earth , that your ladyship would suspect of marrying in this sort of way ! '' 
-- My dear Belinda , how can you stand this fire ? '' 
`` I do not want -- I do not wish for a skreen , I thank you , '' said Belinda , putting it aside , with gentle composure . 
continued lady Boucher -- `` Who , do you guess , miss Portman ? '' 
`` An amiable woman , I should guess , from Mr. Hervey 's general character , '' said Belinda . 
And not from general character , my dear Belinda ; for there is no judging , in these cases , from general character , of what people will like or dislike . '' 
`` Then I will leave it to your ladyship to guess , this time , if you please , '' said Belinda . 
now I recollect , I once heard , that Mr. Hervey was a great admirer of miss Portman , '' said the dowager . 
`` Your ladyship 's information upon that point , I can assure you , from the best authority , was not correct ; '' said Belinda . 
The inquisitive dowager , whose curiosity was put upon a new scent , immediately fastened her eyes upon Belinda 's face ; but from that she could make out nothing . 
`` Admire my knowledge of human nature , my dear Belinda , '' said lady Delacour . 
`` Now she will talk , at the next place she goes to , of nothing , but of my faith in anima of quassia ; and she will forget to make a gossiping story out of that most imprudent hint , I foolishly gave her , about Clarence Hervey 's having been an admirer of yours . 
`` Do not leave the room , Belinda , I have a thousand things to say to you , my dear . '' 
`` And I am sorry for it , '' said Belinda -- `` sorry that he should have so little confidence in me , as to feel jealousy without cause -- without sufficient cause , I should say ; for certainly , your ladyship gave pain , by the manner in which you received Mr. Hervey . '' 
`` It can make no alteration in what I write , '' said Belinda . 
-- She seized it , and hurried with it immediately to Belinda 's room . 
She bolted the door as she spoke -- rolled an arm chair to the fire -- `` Now for it ! '' 
said she , seating herself . 
cried she , breaking the seal . 
`` My dear friend , '' said Belinda , laying her hand upon lady Delacour 's , `` before we open this packet , let me speak to you , whilst our minds are calm . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Belinda , smiling , `` that is the usual wish of those who speak . '' 
Now , my dear , let me anticipate your speech , and , if my anticipation be wrong , then you shall rise to explain ; and I will , '' said she , -LRB- putting her finger on her lips -RRB- `` listen to you , like Harpocrates , without moving an eye-lash . '' 
Belinda , as the most certain way of being heard , consented to hear , before she spoke . 
said Belinda : `` I thank you most sincerely for your kindness ; I should not hesitate to accept from you any species of obligation . '' 
-- my own Belinda ! '' 
`` You have taken it for granted , '' continued Belinda , `` that I am still secretly attached to him -- I assure you that I am not . '' 
`` And you take it for granted , '' said Belinda , `` that I am restrained only by fear of lady Anne Percival , my aunt , and the world , from breaking off with Mr. Vincent ? 
said Belinda , indignantly . 
I really am so much afraid of offending you , that I can hardly find words -- but , in fact , you certainly did once like my poor Clarence , and in spite of all Mr. Percival 's cure for first loves , I am inclined -- '' `` You are inclined , '' said Belinda , `` to consider love as a distemper that can be had but once . '' 
Believe me , Belinda , you are deceiving yourself ; you are not in love with Mr. Vincent ; if you marry him , you will repent it ; you will be miserable . '' 
`` As it would be happy for half the world if they did , '' replied Belinda , mildly , but with a firmness of tone that her ladyship felt -- `` I should despise myself , and deserve no pity from any human being , if , after all I have seen , I could think of marrying from motives of convenience or interest . '' 
I meant not to insinuate such an idea ; I meant but to hint , my dearest Belinda , that a heart , such as yours , is formed for love , in it 's highest , purest , happiest state -- '' `` Such as can be secured only by a union with a man of sense and virtue ; such as may be not merely the amusement of a few months , but the charm of years , '' said Belinda ; `` such as I hope to enjoy with Mr. Vincent , without being in love with him . 
`` Not even your displeasure , my dear friend , '' said Belinda , `` can alter my determination ; and I can bear your anger , for I know it arises from your regard for me . '' 
`` I never loved you so little as at this instant , Belinda . '' 
repeated lady Delacour , as she left the room , `` I never wish to be as cool as you are , Belinda ! '' 
It was about a year before he had seen Belinda , that Clarence Hervey returned from his travels ; he had been in France just before the revolution , when luxury and dissipation were at their height in Paris , and when a universal spirit of licentious gallantry prevailed . 
It was whilst his mind was in this situation , that he became acquainted with Belinda . 
At first , the idea of her having been educated by the matchmaking Mrs. Stanhope prejudiced him against her ; but as he had opportunities of observing her conduct , this prepossession was conquered , and when she had secured his esteem , he could no longer resist her power over his heart . 
In comparison with Belinda , Virginia appeared to him but an insipid , though innocent child ; the one he found was his equal , the other his inferiour ; the one he saw could be a companion , a friend to him for life ; the other would merely be his pupil , or his plaything . 
Belinda had cultivated tastes , an active understanding , a knowledge of literature , the power and the habit of conducting herself . 
Virginia was ignorant and indolent , she had few ideas , and no wish to extend her knowledge . 
She was so entirely unacquainted with the world , that it was absolutely impossible she could conduct herself with that discretion , which must be the combined result of reasoning and experience . 
Mr. Hervey had felt gratuitous confidence in Virginia 's innocence ; but on Belinda 's prudence , which he had opportunities of seeing tried , he gradually learned to feel a different , and a higher species of reliance , which is neither in our power to bestow nor to refuse . 
The virtues of Virginia sprang from sentiment ; those of Belinda , from reason . 
Clarence , whilst he made all these comparisons , became every day more wisely and more fondly attached to Belinda ; and , at length , he became desirous to change the nature of his connexion with Virginia , and to appear to her only in the light of a friend or a benefactor . 
He thought of giving her two thousand pounds , and of leaving her under the care of Mrs. Ormond , till some suitable method of establishing her in the world should occur . 
Pity , generosity , and honour , made him resolve not to abandon this unfortunate girl ; though he felt , that every time he saw her , his love for Belinda increased . 
It was this struggle in his mind , betwixt love and honour , which produced all the apparent inconsistency and irresolution , that puzzled lady Delacour , and perplexed Belinda . 
of beautiful hair , which so unluckily fell at Belinda 's feet , was Virginia 's ; he wa going to take it to the painter , who had made the hair in her picture considerably too dark . 
Now it happened , that the very day , when lady Delacour and Belinda were at the exhibition , the painter called Clarence aside , and informed him , that a gentleman had just inquired from him very eagerly , whether the picture of Virginia was a portrait . 
This was the cause of his taking leave of Belinda in such an abrupt manner : painful indeed were his feelings at that moment , and great the difficulty he felt in parting with her , without giving any explanation of his conduct , which must have appeared to her capricious and mysterious . 
He was aware , that he had explicitly to lady Delacour avowed his admiration of miss Portman , and that in a thousand instances he had betrayed his passion . 
Yet of her love he dared not trust himself to think , whilst his affairs were in this doubtful state . 
He had , it is true , some faint hopes , that a change in Virginia 's situation might produce an alteration in her sentiments , and he resolved to decide his own conduct by the manner in which she should behave , if her father should be found , and she should become heiress to a considerable fortune . 
New views might then open to her imagination ; the world , the fashionable world in all it 's glory , would be before her ; her beauty and fortune would attract a variety of admirers , and Clarence thought , that perhaps her partiality for him might become less exclusive , when she had more opportunities of choice . 
If her love arose merely from circumstances , with circumstances it would change ; if it were only a disease of the imagination , induced by her seclusion from society , it might be cured by mixing with the world ; and then he would be at liberty to follow the dictates of his own heart , and declare his attachment to Belinda . 
But if he should find that change of situation made no alteration in Virginia 's sentiments , if her happiness should absolutely depend upon the realization of those hopes , which he had imprudently excited , he felt that he should be bound to her by all the laws of justice and honour ; laws , which no passion could tempt him to break . 
He endeavoured to dissipate his thoughts by new scenes and employments ; but all his ideas involuntarily centred in Belinda . 
If he saw new characters , he compared them with hers , or considered how far she would approve or condemn them . 
The books that he read were perused with a constant refernce to what she would think or feel ; and during his whole journey he never beheld any beautiful prospect , without wishing that it could at the same instant be seen by Belinda . 
If her name were mentioned but once in his letters , it were because he dared not trust himself to speak of her ; she was for ever present to his mind : but whilst he was writing to lady Delacour , her idea pressed more strongly upon his heart ; he recollected , that it was she who first gave him a just insight into her ladyship 's real character ; he recollected , that she had joined with him in the benevolent design of reconciling her to lord Delacour , and of creating in her mind a taste for domestic happiness . 
This remembrance operated powerfully to excite him to fresh exertions , and the eloquence , which touched lady Delacour so much in these `` edifying `` letters as she called them , was in fact inspired by Belinda . 
Whenever he thought distinctly upon his future plans , Virginia 's attachment , and the hopes which he had imprudently inspired , appeared insuperable obstacles to his union with miss Portman ; but , in more sanguine moments , he flattered himself with a confused notion , that these difficulties would vanish . 
Great were his surprise and alarm , when he received that letter of lady Delacour 's , in which she announced the probability of Belinda 's marriage with Mr. Vincent . 
When he spoke of his attachment to Belinda , and of his doubts respecting Virginia , she could no longer restrain her emotion . 
No man in his senses -- no man , who is not wilfully blind , could doubt her being distractedly fond of you . '' 
Do n't you recollect the time , when you were all impatience to call her yours -- when you thought her the most charming creature in the whole world ? '' 
`` I had not seen Belinda Portman then . '' 
`` And I wish to Heaven you never had seen her ; but O , surely , Mr. Hervey , you will not desert my Virginia ! 
-- Must her health , her happiness , her reputation , all be the sacrifice ? '' 
exclaimed Mrs. Ormond , `` that miss Portman was married , and out of the way -- I shall never forgive myself ! 
With all the strength of his mind , he endeavoured to exclude Belinda from his thoughts , but curiosity -- -LRB- for he would suffer himself to call it by no other name -RRB- -- curiosity to know whether she were actually engaged to Mr. Vincent , obtruded itself with such force , that it could not be resisted . 
When my dear , good miss Portman sent this macaw -- My dear aunt ! 
Belinda Portman is going to be married to Mr. Vincent . 
He determined immediately to force himself to see Belinda and Mr. Vincent , for he fancied , that his mind would be more at case , when he had convinced himself by ocular demonstration , that she was absolutely engaged to another ; that consequently , even if he were free , he could have no chance of gaining her affections . 
The extravagant joy , with which lady Delacour received him , and an indescribable something in her manner , when she looked from him to Belinda , and from Belinda to Mr. Vincent , persuaded him her ladyship wished that he were in Mr. Vincent 's place . 
The idea was so delightful , that his soul was entranced , and for a few minutes Virginia , and every thing that related to her , vanished from his remembrance . 
The request suddenly recalled him to his senses , but he felt that he was not at this moment able to trust himself to her ladyship 's penetration ; he therefore referred her to his letter for that explanation , which he dreaded to make in person , and he escaped from Belinda 's presence , resolving never more to expose himself to such danger . 
What effect this packet produced on lady 's Delacour 's mind , and whether she forgave Belinda for the steadiness of her attachment to Mr. Vincent , we shall not at present stop to inquire ; but having brought up Clarence Hervey 's affairs to the present day , we shall continue his history . 
Though Clarence Hervey was not much disposed to see either Virginia or her father , whilst he was in the state of perturbation , into which he had been thrown by his interview with Belinda ; yet he did not delay to send his servant home , with a note to Mrs. Ormond , to say that he would meet Mr. Hartley , whenever he pleased , at his lawyer 's , to make whatever arrangements might be necessary for proper settlements . 
`` You will not refuse me this quarter of an hour , I am sure , '' continued lord Delacour , `` when you hear that , by favouring me with your attention , you may perhaps materially serve an old -- or rather a young friend of yours , and one whom , I once fancied , was a particular favourite -- I mean , miss Belinda Portman . '' 
At the name of Belinda Portman Clarence Hervey became all attention : he assured his lordship , that he was in no haste ; and all his difficulty now was , to moderate the eagerness of his curiosity . 
Lord Delacour informed Mr. Hervey , `` that he had been lately commissioned , by lady Delacour , to discover what attractions drew a Mr. Vincent so constantly to Mrs. Luttridge 's -- '' Here he was going to explain who Mr. Vincent was ; but Clarence assured him , that he knew perfectly well that he had been a ward of Mr. Percival 's ; that he was a West Indian of large fortune , & c. `` And a lover of miss Portman 's -- that is the most material part of the story to me , '' continued lord Delacour ; `` for otherwise , you know , Mr. vincent would be no more to me than any other gentleman . 
But , in that point of view -- I mean , as a lover of Belinda Portman , and , I may say , on the very eve of marriage with her -- he is highly interesting to my lady Delacour , and to me , and to you , as miss Portman 's wellwisher , doubtless . '' 
`` Now , you must know , '' continued his lordship , `` that lady Delacour has , for a woman , an uncommon share of penetration , and can put things together in a wonderful way : in short , it has come to her -- -LRB- my lady Delacour 's -RRB- -- knowledge , that , before miss Portman was at Oakly-park last summer , and after she left it this autumn , Mr. Vincent was a constant visitor at Mrs. Luttridge 's , whilst at Harrowgate , and used to play high -LRB- though unknown to the Percivals of course -RRB- at billiards , with Mr. Luttridge -- a man , I confess , I disliked always , even when I carried the election for them . 
Mr. Vincent is certainly a very agreeable , open-hearted young man ; but , if he game , God forbid that miss Portman should eves be his wife ! '' 
`` The man , '' resumed lord Delacour , `` must , in my opinion , be very superious indeed , who is deserving of Belinda Portman . 
Mr. Hervey , you do not -- you can not know her merit , as I do . 
It is one thing , sir , to see a fine girl in a ballroom , and another -- quite another -- to live in the house with her for months , and to see her , as I have seen Belinda Portman , in every-day-life , as one may call it . 
Then it is one can judge of the real temper , manners , and character ; and never woman had so sweet a temper , such charming manners , such a fair , open , generous , decided , yet gentle character , as this miss Portman . '' 
`` I should be an unfeeling , ungrateful brute , if I were not sensible of the obligations -- yes , the obligations -- which my lady Delacour and I have received from Belinda Portman . 
Why , sir , she has been the peacemaker between us -- . 
Let us think of her affairs . 
Now , Hervey , you know the whole , do try and save Mr. Vincent , for Belinda Portman 's sake . '' 
Belinda could not be his ; but , in the midst of the bitterest regret , he was supported by the consciousness of his own honour and generosity : he felt a noble species of delight , in the prospect of promoting the happiness of the woman , upon whom his fondest affections had been fixed ; and he rejoiced to feel , that he had sufficient magnanimity to save a rival from ruin . 
`` He will be convinced , that I have a soul incapable of envy ; and , if he suspect my love for Belinda , he will respect the strength of mind with which I can command my passions . 
I take it for granted , that Mr. Vincent must possess a heart and understanding , such as I should desire in a friend , or he could never be -- what he is to Belinda . '' 
`` If he have , '' thought Clarence , `` it is of the utmost consequence to miss Portman , that he should early in life receive a shock , that may leave an indelible impression upon his mind . 
As soon as Mr. Vincent heard of his arrival at Oakly-park , he left half finished his game at billiards ; and , fortunately for him , the charms of Belinda made him forget for some months , that such a thing as a billiard-table existed . 
Scarcely had Belinda left Oakly-park for one week , when the ennui consequent to violent passion became insupportable ; and to console himself for her absence , he flew to the billiard-table . 
Deceived by these appearances , Mrs. Luttridge thought that his affection for Belinda either was , or might be conquered , and her hopes of obtaining his fortune for her niece Annabella revived . 
Mrs. Freke 's sudden departure from Harrowgate confirmed the probability of this quarrel ; yet these two ladies were secretly leagued together in a design of breaking off Mr. Vincent 's match with Belinda , against whom Mrs. Freke had vowed revenge . 
The anonymous letter , which she hoped would work her purpose , produced , however , an effect totally unexpected upon his generous mind -- he did not guess the writer ; but his indignation against such base accusations burst forth with a violence that astounded Mrs. Luttridge : his love for Belinda appeared ten times more enthusiastic than before -- the moment she was accused , he felt himself her defender , as well as her lover . 
He breathed nothing but love ; he would ask no permission ; he would wait for none from Belinda ; he declared that instant he would set out in search of her , and he would tear that infamous letter to atoms in her presence ; he would show her how impossible suspicion was to his nature . 
Mrs. Luttridge also deserves her share of praise , for the manner in which she reproved her niece `` for giving way to her feelings , and for the address , with which she wished to Heaven , that poor Annabella had the calm , philosophic temper , of which miss Portman was , she understood , a most uncommon example . '' 
As Mr. Vincent drove toward London , he reflected upon these last words ; and he could not help thinking , that if Belinda had more faults she would be more amiable . 
Her affection for him , he feared , would never be such as what he felt for her -- never sufficiently tender , or ardent , to constitute his felicity , or to equal his idea of the passion of love . 
These thoughts were however driven from his mind , and scarcely left a trace behind them , when he once more saw and conversed with her . 
The dignity , sincerity , and kindness , which she showed the evening that he put the anonymous letter into her hands , charmed and touched him ; and his real feelings and his enthusiasm conspired to make him believe , that his whole happiness depended on her smiles . 
The confession , which she made to him of her former attachment to Clarence Hervey , as it raised in Vincent 's mind strong emotions of jealousy , increased his passion as much as it piqued his pride , and she appeared in a new and highly interesting light , when he discovered that the coldness of manner , which he had attributed to want of sensibility , arose probably from its excess -- that her heart should have been preoccupied , was more tolerable to him than the belief of her settled indifference . 
He was so intent upon these delightful varieties in his love for Belinda , that it was not , till he had received a reproachful note from Mrs. Luttridge , to remind him of his promised visit from Juba , that he could prevail upon himself to leave Twickenham , even for a few hours . 
His passion for Belinda , which she saw had been by some means or other increased , in spite of the anonymous letter , gave herlittle hopes of Annabella 's succeeding , even with the assistance of Juba , and delicate sensibility . 
The horrour , the agony of mind , which he endured at this sudden ruin , which seemed impending over him , the recollection of Belinda , of Mr. Percival , almost drove him to distraction -- He retreated from the E O table one night , swearing that he never would hazard another guinea . 
His mind was relieved from the sense of immediate danger ; he rejoiced to be saved from the humiliation of confessing his losses to Mr. Percival and Belinda . 
The next day he saw her with unusual pleasure , and this was the very morning when Clarence Hervey paid his visit . 
In the confusion and apologies , which this accident occasioned , Mrs. Luttridge had time to consider what might be the cause of the start , and she combined her suspicions so quickly and so judiciously , that she guessed the truth -- that he feared to be seen at the E O table by a person , who might find it for his interest to tell the truth to Belinda Portman . 
-- `` Mr. Vincent , '' said she , in a low voice , `` I have such a terrible headache , that I am fit for nothing -- I am not up to E O to night , so you must wait for your revenge till to morrow . '' 
-- to be ready to carry the first news of it to Belinda ? '' 
cried he , thus to intrude upon my privacy ; to be a spy upon my action ; to triumph in my ruin ; to witness my despair ; to rob me of the only -- '' He looked wildly at the pistol , which Clarence held in his hand ; then snatching up another which lay upon the table , he continued -- `` You are my enemy -- I know it -- you are my rival -- I know it -- Belinda loves you -- Nay , affect not to start -- this is no time for dissimulation -- Belinda loves you -- you know it -- for her sake , for your own , put me out of the world -- put me out of torture . 
-- O , Belinda , is this the being you prefer to me ? 
-- wretch as I am , my soul never stooped to falsehood ; treachery I abhor ; courage , honour , and a heart worthy of Belinda , I possess . 
There was something so open in Hervey 's countenance ; such a strong expression of truth in his manner , that it could not be resisted , and Vincent , in an altered voice , exclaimed : `` You acknowledge that you have loved Belinda -- and could you cease to love her ? 
-- And , loving her , must you not detest me ? '' 
In one word , to put you at ease with me for ever , I have no pretensions , I can have none , to miss Portman . 
Go to Belinda ; tell her so : tell her , that if she had ever the slightest regard for me , I deserve it no longer . 
Teil her to forget , despise , detest me . 
Give her joy , that she has escaped having a gamester for a husband . '' 
`` I will , '' said Clarence , `` I will , if you please , tell her what I believe to be true , that the agony you have felt this night , the dear-bought experience you have had , will be for ever a warning . '' 
`` Swear to me , for Belinda 's sake -- solemnly swear to me , that you will never more trust your happiness and hers to the hazard of a die -- swear that you will never more , directly or indirectly , play at any game of chance , and I will restore to you the fortune , the happiness that you have lost . '' 
`` When she knows that I have it in my power to expose her to public shame , she will instantly refund all that she has iniquitously won from you . 
Even among gamblers she would be blasted , for ever , by this discovery : she knows it , and if she dared to brave public opinion , we have then a sure resource in the law -- prosecute her . 
But she will never let the affair go into a court of justice . 
I will see her early , as early as I can to morrow , and put you out of suspense . '' 
exclaimed Vincent ; `` I can not express to you what I feel ; but your own heart , your own approbation -- '' `` Farewel , good night , '' interrupted Clarence , with a benevolent smile ; `` I see that I have made a friend ; I was determined that Belinda 's husband should be my friend -- I have succeeded beyond my hopes . 
In the silence of the night , when the hurry of action was over , and the enthusiasm of generosity began to subside , the words , which had escaped from Mr. Vincent , in theparoxysm of despair and rage -- the words -- '' Belinda loves you '' -- recurred to Clarence Hervey ; and it required all his power over himself , to banish the sound from his ear , and the idea from his mind . 
He was impatient to see Belinda ; and full of generous and grateful sentiments , in this first moment of joy , he determined to conceal nothing from her ; to make at once the confession of his own imprudence and the eulogium of Clarence Hervey 's generosity . 
He spent the remainder of the morning with his uncle ; and there he received a charming letter from Belinda ; -- that letter , which she had written and sent , whilst lady Delacour was reading Clarence Hervey 's packet . 
Miss Portman , at the conclusion of her letter , informed him , that lady Delacour purposed being in Berkeley square the next day ; that they were to spend a week in town , on account of Mrs. Margaret Delacour , who had promised her ladyship a visit : and to go to Twickenham would be a formidable journey to an infirm old lady , who seldom stirred out of her house . 
Whatever displeasure lady Delacour felt towards her friend Belinda , on account of her coldness to Mr. Hervey , and her steadiness to Mr. Vincent , had by this time subsided . 
The morning after they arrived in town , she came into Belinda 's room , with an air of more than usual sprightliness and satisfaction . 
-- But it is very imprudent to excite your expectations , my dear Belinda . 
`` This prospect of mischief seems to have put your ladyship in wonderfully good spirits , '' said Belinda , smiling . 
I know , that I can not oblige you more , my dear Belinda , than by seasoning my discourse with a little conjugal flattery . 
`` The smile may be the more readily forgiven , '' said Belinda , `` since , I am sure , you are conscious , that it reflected almost as much upon yourself as upon lord Delacour . '' 
This last enigmatical sentence Belinda could not prevail upon lady Delacour to explain . 
Vincent wavered in his resolution to confess the truth to Belinda . 
Though he had determined upon this in the first moment of joyful enthusiasm , yet the delay of four-and-twenty hours had made a material change in his feelings : his dread of losing Belinda by his sincerity increased , the more time he had for reflection . 
Upon the present occasion , his love for Belinda confounded all his moral calculations : one moment , his feelings as a man of honour forbade him to condescend to that meanness of dissimulation but the next instant , his feelings as a lover prevaileds and he satisfied his conscience , by the idea that , as his vow must preclude all danger of his return to the gaming-table in future , it would be only creating an unnecessary alarm in Belinda 's mind , to speak to her of his past imprudence . 
Left alone with Belinda , his embarrasment increased , and the unsuspecting kindness of her manner was to him the most bitter reproach . 
He stood in a silent agony , whilst in a playful tone she smiled and said , `` Where are your thoughts ? 
`` I have not interrupted you , '' said Belinda , when he paused ; `` and I do not , from false generosity or politeness , preclude you from the opportunity of proving your integrity , by assuring you , that it was suspected , and that your defence is totally unnecessary . 
She held out her hand to him as she spoke , with much sweetness in her countenance , and an air of perfect sincerity . 
`` Whether you could or could not , I am sure you would not , '' said Belinda ; `` and I trust myself with more pleasure to those who have not the will , than to those who have not the power , to deceive me . '' 
But observing the excessive agitation of his whole frame at this instant , her gayety forsook her . 
How long , '' said Belinda , `` will you keep me in suspense ? 
-- O , Belinda ! 
`` This is poetry -- almost blank verse , '' said Belinda , smiling . 
repeated Belinda , with a look of sudden terrour . 
`` Then how , '' said Belinda , `` can you do me the injustice to fear that any misfortune should deprive you of my affection ? 
`` I have heard that so often , that I can not help believing it , '' said Belinda ; `` but now , without farther hesitation , communicate , impart , or confess this dreadful misfortune . '' 
`` I am not so romantic as to imagine , that I could be happy with you or you with me , if we were in absolute want of the common comforts of life ; but if your word poverty be only a figure of speech ; if between us there yet remain what prudence , not what the cant of fashion and affectation would allow to be , a competence , I can easily part with useless luxuries , '' said Belinda : -- `` to be more explicit , I can live without an equipage , and in the country . 
`` You rather offend , than gratify me , by these praises , '' said Belinda , `` Are you surprised , that I should act as you would do in my place ? 
You have lost your wealth by the fraud and villainy of one , in whom you had confidence ; you shall not lose your happiness by the inconstancy or meanness of another , in whom you have placed yet greater confidence , '' said Belinda , with more tenderness , than she had ever before spoken to Mr. Vincent . 
`` Compose yourself , than , '' continued she , `` and let us look into your affairs at our leisure , and explain to me how all this has happened . '' 
`` My generous , charming , adorable , Belinda ! 
`` You have not done wisely , '' said Belinda , rising with a look of such serious displeasure as struck him speechless ; `` you have shown me , that I never stood as high in your esteem as I believed , and as I deserved . '' 
He had not the courage to increase her displeasure . 
He knew that his secret was safe with Clarence Hervey : Mrs. Luttridge would be silent , for her own sake ; and neither lady Delacour nor Belinda had any connexion with her society . 
The next day , miss Portman observed , that Mr. Vincent looked extremely ill ; and softened by the sorrow , that he expressed at having incurred her displeasure , she blamed herself for the harshness , with which she had spoken the preceding day . 
She forgave an errour , which she thought had been more than sufficiently punished , and Mr. Vincent was reinstated in her favour . 
And now he actually approached the completion of his hopes : The very morning before that , which was fixed for their marriage , Mr. Vincent went to Gray , the jeweller , for some trinkets , which he had bespoke for Belinda . 
When Belinda 's first alarm for Mr. Vincent 's safety , was over , she anxiously questioned lord Delacour as to the particulars of all that had passed between Mr. Vincent and sir Philip , that the might judge of the manner , in which her lover had conducted himself . 
Lady Delacour rejoiced to perceive , that this account made Belinda uncommonly serious . 
He had now summoned courage , to acknowledge to Belinda all that had happened , and was proceeding , without difficulty , down stairs , when he was suddenly struck by the sound of a voice , which he little expected at this moment a voice he had formerly been accustomed to hear with pleasure , but now it smote him to the heart : -- it was the voice of Mr. Percival . 
I have only one question to ask you , on which depends my esteem -- Have you informed miss Portman of this affair ? '' 
`` I have not yet told her , but I was actually half down stairs in my way to tell her . '' 
`` I will with pleasure , '' said Mr. Percival -- `` I will go this instant -- but I can not say , that I have any hope of persuading Belinda , to believe in your being irrevocably reclaimed from the charms of play . '' 
`` Indeed , my excellent friend , she may only upon me : I feel such horrour at the past , such heartfelt resolution against all future temptation , that you may pledge yourself for my total reformation . '' 
The next morning Mr. Vincent received the following letter from Belinda . 
`` Belinda Portman . '' 
He saw that all hopes of being united to Belinda were over , and he hurried as far from her as possible . 
Her letter rather soothed than irritated his temper ; her praises of his generosity were highly gratifying , and they had so powerful an effect upon his mind , that he was determined to prove that they were deserved . 
Before he left London he wrote a full account of this whole transaction , to be given to miss Portman after his departure . 
It was delivered to Belinda by poor Juba , who would willingly have accompanied his unfortunate master in his voluntary exile , but Mr. Vincent would not permit him to give this proof of attachment . 
The poor fellow put his master 's letter into miss Portman 's hand , without being able to utter one syllable ; the big tears rolled down his black cheeks , when she kindly said to him -- `` I shall see you again , Juba , soon , at your cottage . '' 
Belinda was deeply touched by this faithful creature 's sensibility . 
He recalled to her mind some of the most amiable traits in his master 's character , some of the happy days that she had spent in Mr. Vincent 's company . 
His letter -- his farewell letter -- she could not read without great emotion . 
His generosity , in speaking of Clarence Hervey , was not lost upon her . 
`` What a pity , '' thought Belinda , `` that with so many good and great qualities , I should be forced to bid him adieu for ever ! '' 
Though she strongly felt the pain of this separation , yet she could not recede from her decision : nothing could tempt her to connect herself with a man , who had the fatal taste for play . 
Even Mr. Percival , much as he loved his ward , much as he wished for his union with Belinda , dared not pledge his honour for Mr. Vincent on this point . 
Reason and prudence then forbade her to trust the happiness of her life to a vain promise . 
She trembled at the thoughts of having been so near forming an indissoluble connexion with one , who had such a dangerous , and as she firmly believed , incurable taste . 
Even her sense of escape was attended with many painful feelings : not that she had ever loved him with passion , but she had been habituated to think of him with much kindness , esteem , and affection . 
Her thoughts had now for some months been fixed upon him , and she could not suddenly change their course , or console herself for his loss . 
She was soothed , however , by a most kind and sensible letter from lady Anne Percival , who expressed the highest approbation of her conduct , the most friendly concern for her disappointment , and the most polite and sincere hopes , that Belinda would still continue to think of her with affection and esteem ; though she had been so rash in her advice , and though her friendship had been apparently so selfish . 
Belinda was conscious , that whatever might be her present regret , she had acted prudently in breaking off her connexion with Mr. Vincent ; she endeavoured to tranquillize her mind , and she occupied herself without ceasing , for she found employment the best relief from painful recollection . 
`` I hope , Belinda , you give me credit , for having judged better of Mr. Vincent than lady Anne Percival did ? '' 
`` And there was something so handsome in her manner of writing to me , when she found out her errour , '' said Belinda -- `` Very true , and my friend Mr. Percival behaved handsomely . 
`` You place admiration not only above money , but above love , in your climax , I perceive , '' said Belinda , smiling . 
`` No one could be farther from my thoughts , '' said Belinda . 
`` Perhaps they are , '' said Belinda ; `` but I really and truly am not inclined to think of love at present ; particularly as there is no necessity that I should . '' 
Belinda took up a book , and lady Delacour for one half hour abstained from any farther raillery . 
said Belinda . 
`` I conjure you , '' cried Belinda , `` if you have the least regard for my honour and happiness -- '' `` I have not the least , but the greatest ; and depend upon it , my dear , I will do nothing that shall injure that dignity of mind , and delicacy of character , which I admire and love , as much as Clarence Hervey did , and does . 
-- she finished these words , she rang for her carriage . 
`` I do n't ask you to go out with me , my dear Belinda ; I give you leave to sit in this arm chair , till I come back again , with your feet upon the fender , a book in your hand , and this little table beside you , like lady S. 's picture of Comfort . '' 
This was so unusual , that Belinda could not avoid taking notice of it . 
Notwithstanding her ladyship 's eulogium upon her own delicate sense of propriety , miss Portman could not confide , with perfect resignation , in her prudence . 
`` Your ladyship reproached me once , '' said she , in a playful tone , `` for my provoking want of curiosity : you have completely cured me of this defect , for never was woman more curious than I am , at this instant , to know the secret scheme that you have in agitation . '' 
A fact Company came in , and relieved Belinda from any farther raillery . 
cried lady Delacour -- she had sufficient presence of mind not to look directly at Belinda ; but she fixed the dowager 's eyes , by repeating -- `` married ! 
Her ladyship smiled , and kept them in play by her address , on purpose to withdraw all eyes from miss Portman , whilst , from time to time , she stole a glance at Belinda , to observe how she was affected by what passed : she was provoked by Belinda 's self-possession . 
When the ladies retired after the dessert , she again commenced hostilities : she dared not come to open war with Mrs. Delacour ; but in a by-battle , in a corner , she carried every thing before her ; and she triumphantly whispered , `` We shall see , ma'am , that it will turn out , as I told you , that miss Rachel , or Virginia , or whatever he pleases to call her , has been what I said ; and , as I said , nobody will visit her , not a soul : fifty people I can count , who have declared to me they 've made-up Y their minds ; and my own 's made up , I candidly confess ; and lady Delacour , I am sure by her silence and looks , is of my way of thinking , and has no opinion of the young lady : as to miss Portman , she is , poor thing ! 
of course so wrapped up in her own affairs , no wonder she says nothing . 
That was a sad business of Mr. Vincent 's ; I am surprised to see her look even as well as she does after it . 
Fighting that duel , about her , with sir Philip Baddely , settled his love -- so he is gone to Germany , and she is left to wear the willow , which , you see , becomes her , as well as every thing else . 
Did she eat any dinner , ma'am -- you sat next her ? '' 
Then perhaps sir Philip Baddely 's on again -- Lord bless me , what a match would that be for her ! 
The seventh of her nieces this -- But look , there 's Mrs. Delacour , leading miss Portman off into the trictrac cabinet , with a face full of business -- her hand in hers -- Lord , I did not know they were on that footing ! 
I wonder what 's going forward -- suppose old Hartley was to propose for miss Portman -- there would be a denouement ! 
Did he ever see miss Portman ? 
In the mean time , Mrs. Delacour , unconscious of the curiosity she had excited , was speaking to Belinda in the trictrac cabinet . 
`` My dear miss Portman , '' said she , `` you have a great deal of good nature , else I should not venture to apply to you on the present occasion . 
`` I will do any thing in my power to oblige any friend of yours , madam , '' said Belinda ; `` but of whom are you speaking ? '' 
`` He was never an admirer of mine , '' said Belinda ; `` but that does not make me the less disposed to serve him , as a friend -- tell me , how it can possibly be in my power ? '' 
It 's often cowardice that makes people ill natured ; have you the courage , my good miss Portman , to be the first to do a benevolent action ? 
I do assure you , '' continued Mrs. Delacour with great earnestness -- `` I do assure you , I would as soon put my hand into that fire , this moment , as ask you to do any thing that I thought improper -- But forgive me for pressing this point ; I am anxious to have your suffrage in her favour : miss Belinda Portman 's character for prudence and propriety stands so high , and is fixed so firmly , that she may venture to let us cling to it ; and I am as firmly convinced of the poor girl 's innocence , as I am of yours , and when you see her , you will be of my opinion . '' 
`` And I assure you , Mrs. Delacour , '' said Belinda , `` that you have wasted a great deal of eloquence upon this occasion , for -- '' `` I am sorry for it , '' interrupted Mrs. Dencour , rising from her seat , with a look of some displeasure ; `` I meant not to distress or offend you , miss Portman , by my eloquence -- I am only concerned , that I should have so far mistaken your character as to expose myself to this refusal . '' 
`` I have given no refusal , '' said Belinda , mildly , `` you did not let me finish my sentence . '' 
`` You are not at all obliged to me , '' said Belinda . 
Lady Anne Percival inspired me with this belief , and miss Portman confirms it . 
`` I have not a right to your admiration , '' said Belinda , `` for I must honestly confess to you , that I should not have this courage , if there were any danger in the case ; I do not think , that , in doubtful cases , it is the business of a young woman to hazard her own reputation , by an attempt to preserve another 's : I do not imagine , at least , that I am of sufficient consequence , in the world , for this purpose ; therefore I should never attempt it . 
It is the duty of such women as Mrs. Delacour , whose reputations are beyond the power of scandal , to come forward in the defence of injured innocence : but this would not be courage in Belinda Portman , it would be presumption and temerity . '' 
After the company was gone , lady Delacour , was much surprised , by the earnestness with which Belinda pressed the request , that they might the next morning pay a visit to Virginia . 
In their way thither , Belinda , to divert her own thoughts , and to rouse lady Delacour from the profound and unnatural silence , into which she had fallen , petitioned her to finish the history of sir Philip Baddely , the dog , miss Annabella Luttridge , and her billet-doux . 
Very well -- go on Belinda . 
Curiosity was not , at this instant , the strongest passion in Belinda 's mind . 
Belinda and lady Delacour exchanged a glance of surprise and admiration . 
Belinda endeavoured to engage her in conversation , and to her she talked with ease , and even with freedom . 
Virginia examined miss Portman 's countenance with a species of artless curiosity and interest , that was not restrained by factitious politeness . 
This examination was not peculiarly agreeable to Belinda , yet it was made with so much apparent simplicity , that she could not be displeased . 
Belinda rejoiced , that the universal curiosity , which lady Delacour had inspired , prevented any one 's observing the sudden change in Mr. Hervey 's countenance , when he beheld her . 
Clarence Hervey raised her from the ground , and Belinda sprinkled water over her face . 
exclaimed Mrs. Ormond , trembling so violently , that she could not sustain Virginia 's weight . 
cried Belinda . 
`` Let us leave her to miss Portman ; she has more presence of mind than any of us . '' 
`` No ; it beats stronger and stronger , '' said Belinda . 
raise her a little , dear Belinda ; she is coming to herself . '' 
`` Had not you better draw the curtain again before that picture , '' said miss Portman ; `` lest she should see it , the moment that she opens her eyes ? '' 
`` I am well -- quite well -- better than I deserve to be '' -- and she pressed Belinda 's hand , as if to thank her for assisting and supporting her . 
`` We may safely leave her now , '' whispered Belinda to lady Delacour ; `` we are strapgers , and our presence only distresses her . '' 
Clarence Hervey , to give her a convincing proof , that Mrs. Ormond had misled her as to his sentiments , immediately avowed his passion for Belinda . 
`` You have relieved me from all doubt , all fear , all anxiety , '' said Virginia , with the sweetest expression of innocent affection in her countenance . 
May Belinda -- is not that her name ? 
-- May Belinda -- '' At this moment lady Delacour half opened the door , exclaiming -- `` Human patience can wait no longer ! '' 
`` In love with Belinda ! 
I will not keep you from her a second . 
But stay -- I am sorry to tell you , that as she informed me this morning , her heart is not at present inclined to love . 
As he entered the room , Clarence Hervey 's first glance was at Belinda , and rapid as it was , it explained his whole heart . 
`` My dear Belinda , '' whispered lady Delacour , `` if I might judge by the colour of this cheek , which has been for some moments permanent crimson , I should guess , that you were beginning to find out of what use the sun is to the dial . '' 
`` You will not let me hear what Mr. Hervey is saying , '' replied Belinda ; `` I am very curious . '' 
`` You shall hear of him just as I did , if you please , '' said lady Delacour , `` and if Belinda will submit to hear me tell the same story twice . '' 
Clarence , I advise you to accompany captain Sunderland on this cruise , do n't you , Belinda ? '' 
`` But I hope you will remember , dear lady Delacour , '' said Belinda , `` that there is nothing in which novellists are so apt to err , as in hurrying things toward the conclusion . 
`` That 's right , my dear Belinda , true to your principles to the last gasp . 
I have no objection to saying , that the happy couples were united by the worthy Mr. Moreton ; that Mr. Percival gave Belinda away ; and that immediately after the ceremony , he took the whole party down with him to Oakly-park . 
-- Or , we may conclude , if you like it better , with a characteristic letter of congratulation from Mrs. Stanhope to her dearest niece , Belinda , acknowledging that she was wrong to quarrel with her , for refusing sir Philip Baddely , and giving her infinite credit for that admirable management of Clarence Hervey , which she hopes will continue through life . '' 
-- Captain Sunderland -- kneeling with Virginia , if you please , sir , at her father 's feet -- You in the act of giving them your blessing , Mr. Hartley -- Mrs. Ormond clasps her hands with joy -- Nothing can be better than that , madam -- I give you infinite credit for the attitude -- Clarence , you have a right to Belinda 's hand , and may kiss it too -- Nay , miss Portman , it is the rule of the stage -- Now , where 's my lord Delacour ?
