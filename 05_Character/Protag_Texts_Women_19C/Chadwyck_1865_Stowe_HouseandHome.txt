But all this while my wife sits on her roll of carpet , looking into my face for approbation , and Marianne and Jenny are pouring into my ear a running-fire of `` How sweet ! 
`` This house ought to have inside blinds , '' said Marianne , with all the confident decision of youth ; `` this carpet will be ruined , if the sun is allowed to come in like that . '' 
`` Now , papa thinks we have been foolish , '' said Marianne , `` and he has his own way of making a good story of it ; but , after all , I desire to know if people are never to get a new carpet . 
said my wife , in a tone of remonstrance ; but Jane and Marianne laughed and colored . 
I only said to Marianne that to have Brussels in the parlor and that old mean-looking ingrain carpet in the hall did not seem exactly the thing ; and , in fact , you know , mamma , Messrs. Ketchem & Co. showed us such a lovely pattern , designed to harmonize with our parlor-carpet . '' 
said Marianne . 
For , among my other confidences , you may recollect I stated to you that our Marianne was busy in those interesting cares and details which relate to the preparing and ordering of another dwelling . 
I had merely so arranged my affairs as to put into the hands of my bankers , subject to my wife 's order , the very modest marriage-portion which I could place at my girl 's disposal ; and Marianne and Jenny , unused to the handling of money , were incessant in their discussions with ever-patient mamma as to what was to be done with it . 
I say Marianne and Jenny , for , though the case undoubtedly is Marianne 's , yet , like everything else in our domestic proceedings , it seems to fall , somehow or other , into Jenny 's hands , through the intensity and liveliness of her domesticity of nature . 
Marianne is a soft , thoughtful , quiet girl , not given to many words ; and though , when you come fairly at it , you will find , that , like most quiet girls , she has a will five times as inflexible as one who talks more , yet in all family counsels it is Jenny and mamma that do the discussion , and her own little well-considered `` Yes , '' or `` No , '' that finally settles each case . 
If I were beginning as Marianne is , I should just set aside a thousand dollars for my silver , and be content with a few plain articles . 
She should buy all her furniture at Messrs. David and Saul 's . 
`` I shall try , '' she said ; `` but you know Marianne is inexperienced , and Jenny is so ardent and active , and so confident , too . 
Marianne had nestled close to her mother , and laid her head on her knee ; and though Jenny sat up straight as a pin , yet her ever-busy knitting was dropped in her lap , and I saw the glint of a tear in her quick , sparkling eye , -- yes , actually a little bright bead fell upon her work ; whereupon she started up actively , and declared that the fire wanted just one more stick to make a blaze before bedtime ; and then there was such a raking among the coals , such an adjusting of the andirons , such vigorous arrangement of the wood , and such a brisk whisking of the hearth-brush , that it was evident Jenny had something on her mind . 
`` Papa , '' said Marianne , `` I wish you would tell me exactly how youwould spend that money you gave me for house-furnishing . 
`` But then , papa , '' said Marianne , `` I ca n't help feeling sorry that one ca n't live in such a way as to have beautiful things around one . 
Our circle was enlightened this evening by the cheery visage of Bob Stephens , seated , as of right , close to Marianne 's work-basket . 
So , after the reading of my last article , we had a `` raking-up talk , '' -- to wit , Jenny , Marianne , and I , with Bob Stephens ; -- my wife , still busy at her work-basket , sat at the table a little behind us . 
`` Of course he has , '' said Marianne . 
`` I would not recommend , '' said I , `` a young housekeeper , just beginning , to rest much for her home ornament on plant-keeping , unless she has an experience of her own love and talent in this line , which makes her sure of success ; for plants will not thrive , if they are forgotten or overlooked , and only tended in occasional intervals ; and , as Marianne says , neglected plants are the most forlorn of all things . '' 
`` But , papa , '' said Marianne , anxiously , `` there , in those patent parlors of John 's that you wrote of , flowers acted a great part . '' 
`` Well , papa , '' said Marianne , `` in your chemical analysis of John 's rooms , what is the next thing to the sunshine ? '' 
`` I see what you are going to say , '' said Marianne . 
`` That 's true , '' said Marianne , reflectively . 
`` To tell the truth , '' said Marianne , `` I never did like the pattern exactly ; as to uniformity of tint , it might match with anything , for there 's every color of the rainbow in it . '' 
`` Well , Marianne , how many yards of this wonderfully cheap carpet do you want ? '' 
`` Well , Marianne , if you want a man 's advice in the case , mine is at your service . '' 
`` Papa , I 'll do it , '' said Marianne . 
Nothing would delight me more than to put an unlimited credit to Marianne 's account , and let her work out the problems of harmonious color in velvet and damask . 
`` Then , Marianne , '' said Bob , `` we have something to start with , at all events . 
`` Well , '' said Marianne , `` mamma and I were counting over my treasures the other day . 
`` But , papa , '' said Marianne , `` I am troubled about one thing . 
`` Well , '' said Marianne , `` unless one has a great deal of money , it seems to me that the investment in these pretty fragilities is rather a poor one . '' 
There is my advice for you , Marianne . '' 
At the same time , let me say , in parenthesis , that my wife , whose weakness is china , informed me that night , when we were by ourselves , that she was ordering secretly a tea-set as a bridal gift for Marianne , every cup of which was to be exquisitely painted with the wild-flowers of America , from designs of her own , -- a thing , by the by , that can now be very nicely executed in our country , as one may find by looking in at our friend Briggs 's on School Street . 
`` It will last her all her life , '' she said , `` and always be such a pleasure to look at , -- and a pretty tea-table is such a pretty sight ! '' 
Here Marianne shivered and drew up a shawl , and Jenny gaped ; my wife folded up the garment in which she had set the last stitch , and the clock struck twelve . 
`` And Marianne and I come out entirely at the little end of the horn , '' said Jenny , laughing ; `` yet I wash the breakfast-cups and dust the parlors , and have always fancied myself a notable housekeeper . '' 
`` One thing I know , '' said Marianne , -- `` and that is , I wish I had been brought up so , and knew all that I should , and had all the strength and adroitness that those women had . 
Just think ; how is Marianne to furnish her house here without French papers and English carpets ? 
said Marianne . 
Marianne and I have counted six new hats apiece of those girls ' , -- new , you know , just out of the milliner 's shop ; and last Sunday they came out in such lovely puffed tulle bonnets ! 
Were n't they lovely , Marianne ? 
`` They ca n't know anything about it , then , '' said Jenny , decisively ; `` for , certainly , nobody can be decent , and invest less in millinery than Marianne and I do . '' 
said Marianne . 
`` But , mamma , you know our allowance is n't anything like that , -- it is quite a slender one , though not so small as yours was , '' said Marianne . 
`` I do assure you that it is the easiest thing in the world for a girl to make away with a thousand dollars a year , and not have so much to show for it either as Marianne and Jenny . '' 
`` The thing is , '' said Marianne , `` how can any woman , I , for example , know what is too much or too little ? 
`` Yes , '' said Marianne , `` it 's the fashion to talk as if all the extravagance of the country was perpetrated by women . 
`` Certainly not , mamma , '' said Marianne . 
`` But , papa , '' said Marianne , with a twinge of that exacting sensitiveness by which the child is characterized , `` I think I am an economist , thanks to you and mamma , so far as knowing just what my income is , and keeping within it ; but that does not satisfy me , and it seems that is n't all of economy ; -- the question that haunts me is , Might I not make my little all do more and better than I do ? '' 
said Marianne . 
`` Well , papa , '' said Marianne , `` in the matter of dress now , -- how much ought one to spend just to look as others do ? '' 
Our Marianne has gone from us with a new name to a new life , and a modest little establishment not many squares off claims about as much of my wife 's and Jenny 's busy thoughts as those of the proper mistress . 
Marianne , as I always foresaw , is a careful and somewhat anxious housekeeper . 
Sour bread had appeared on the table , -- bitter , acrid coffee had shocked and astonished the palate , -- lint had been observed on tumblers , and the spoons had sometimes dingy streaks on the brightness of their first bridal polish , -- beds were detected made shockingly awry , -- and Marianne came burning with indignation to her mother . 
`` Such a little family as we have , and two strong girls , '' said she , -- `` everything ought to be perfect ; there is really nothing to do . 
`` As to that , '' said Marianne , `` I know nothing . 
My wife smiled , and said , -- `` You know , Marianne , I proposed to you to be our family bread-maker for one month of the year before you married . '' 
`` I believe , '' said Marianne , `` it 's a kind she makes herself . 
`` Now , '' said I , `` Marianne , if you want my advice , I 'll give it to you gratis : -- Make your own bread for one month . 
`` I did not think , '' said Marianne , `` that so simple a thing required so much attention . '' 
`` So it appears , '' said Marianne , gayly , `` that I must begin to study my profession at the eleventh hour . '' 
`` Do n't you think , mamma , '' said Marianne , `` that there has been a sort of reaction against woman 's work in our day ? 
OUR gallant Bob Stephens , into whose life-boat our Marianne has been received , has lately taken the mania of house-building into his head . 
During all his courtship as much time was taken up in planning a future house as if he had money to build one ; and all Marianne 's patterns , and the backs of half their letters , were scrawled with ground-plans and elevations . 
Marianne is exercised about china-closets and pantries , and about a bedroom on the ground-floor , -- for , like all other women of our days , she expects not to have strength enough to run up-stairs oftener than once or twice a week ; and my wife , who is a native genius in this line , and has planned in her time dozens of houses for acquaintances , wherein they are at this moment living happily , goes over every day with her pencil and ruler the work of rearranging the plans , according as the ideas of the young couple veer and vary . 
`` Well , then , '' says Marianne , `` let 's put two feet more into the width of the house . '' 
`` I say , '' says Bob , bending over her shoulder , `` here , take your two feet in the parlor , and put two more feet on to the other side of the hall-stairs '' ; and he dashes heavily with his pencil . 
exclaims Marianne , `` there are the kitchen-pantries ! 
There 's Bob been studying architectural antiquities , and nobody knows what , and sketching all sorts of curly-whorlies ; and Marianne has her notions about a parlor and boudoir and china-closets and bedroom-closets ; and Bob wants a baronial hall ; and mamma stands out for linen-closets and bathing-rooms and all that ; and so among them all it will just end in getting them head over ears in debt . '' 
So that evening , when Bob and Marianne had dropped in as usual , and while the customary work of drawing and rubbing-out was going on at Mrs. Crowfield 's sofa , I produced my paper and read as follows : -- OUR HOUSE . 
`` Do n't you remember , Marianne , how many dismal , commonplace , shabby houses we trailed through ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Marianne . 
`` One would willingly , '' said Marianne , `` dispense with frightful stone ornaments in front , and with heavy mouldings inside , which are of no possible use or beauty , and with showy plaster cornices and centre pieces in the parlor-ceilings , and even with marble mantels , for the luxury of hot and cold water in each chamber , and a couple of comfortable bath-rooms . 
`` One of the greatest reforms that could be , in these reforming days , '' she observed , `` would be to have women architects . 
`` I say , Marianne , '' said Bob , `` have we got fireplaces in our chambers ? '' 
`` Mamma took care of that , '' said Marianne . 
`` Papa 's hobby is sunshine , '' said Marianne . 
`` Well , papa , '' said Marianne , `` you have made out all your four elements in your house , except one . 
`` Papa , '' said Marianne , `` you are closing up your House and Home Papers , are you not ? '' 
`` But while the case is so , '' said Marianne , `` we ca n't help it . 
`` Well , now , '' said Bob , `` about this old question of Sunday-keeping , Marianne and I are much divided . 
I am always for doing something that she thinks is n't the thing . '' 
`` Well , you see , '' said Marianne , `` Bob is always talking against our old Puritan fathers , and saying all manner of hard things about them . 
`` There is a deal of nonsense about everything human beings have to deal with , '' said I. `` And , '' said Marianne , `` how to find out what is nonsense ? '' 
`` Marianne holds these as prime articles of faith . '' 
`` Yes , -- they doubtless are most worthy and merciful , in giving to the poor cook one day she may call her own , and rest from the heat of range and cooking-stove . 
`` Well , '' said Bob , `` here 's Marianne always breaking her heart about my reading on Sunday . 
`` But do n't you think , '' said Marianne , `` that there is danger in too much fiction ? ''
