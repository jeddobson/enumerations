-- On the present occasion , as only two of Mr W. 's children were at home , & one was always necessary as companion to himself , for he was sickly & had lost his wife , one only could profit by the kindness of their friends ; Miss Emma Watson who was very recently returned to her family from the care of an Aunt who had brought her up , was to make her first public appearance in the Neighbourhood ; & her eldest sister , whose delight in a Ball was not lessened by a ten years Enjoyment , had some merit in chearfully undertaking to drive her & all her finery in the old chair to D. on the important morng . 
-- As they splashed along the dirty Lane Miss Watson thus instructed & cautioned her inexperienc 'd sister . 
`` I think I have heard you speak of him before , said Emma . 
-- said Emma smiling . 
-- I have not been very well used Emma among them , I hope you will have better luck . '' 
A sigh accompanied these words , which Emma respected in silence -- but her sister after a short pause went on -- `` You will naturally ask why it did not take place , & why he is married to another Woman , while I am still single . 
-- Yes Emma , Penelope was at the bottom of it all . 
-- She thinks everything fair for a Husband ; I trusted her , she set him against me , with a veiw of gaining him herself , & it ended in his discontinuing his visits & soon after marrying somebody else . 
-- `` You quite shock me by what you say of Penelope -- said Emma . 
-- Emma shook her head in acquiescence . 
-- `` I am sorry for her anxieties , said Emma , -- but I do not like her plans or her opinions . 
I shall be afraid of her . 
-- She must have too masculine & bold a temper . 
I have been at school , Emma , & know what a Life they lead ; you never have . 
-- said Emma . 
-- I should like to look in upon you Emma . 
-- Emma for a moment made no answer -- at last she said -- `` I wish Elizabeth , you had not made a point of my going to this Ball , I wish you were going instead of me . 
-- `` My dearest Emma cried Eliz : warmly -- do you think I would do such a thing ? 
-- Beleive me Emma , I am not so selfish as that comes to . 
-- No Emma , whoever stays at home this winter , it sha n't be you . 
Emma expressed her gratitude , & for a few minutes they jogged on in silence . 
`` We must not all expect to be individually lucky replied Emma . 
Such were the last audible sounds of Miss Watson 's voice , before they passed thro ' the Turnpike gate & entered on the pitching of the Town -- the jumbling & noise of which made farther Conversation most thoroughly undesirable . 
-- The old Mare trotted heavily on , wanting no direction of the reins to take the right Turning , & making only one Blunder , in proposing to stop at the Milleners , before she drew up towards Mr Edward 's door . 
Emma had seen the Edwardses only one morng at Stanton , they were therefore all but Strangers to her , & tho ' her spirits were by no means insensible to the expected joys of the Evening , she felt a little uncomfortable in the thought of all that was to precede them . 
Her conversation with Eliz : too giving her some very unpleasant feelings , with respect to her own family , had made her more open to disagreable impressions from any other cause , & increased her sense of the awkwardness of rushing into Intimacy on so slight an acquaintance . 
-- Emma was soon left to know what they could be , by Eliz . 
-- After a cordial reception of Emma , he turned to his daughter with `` Well Mary , I bring you good news . 
-- Emma was shewn to a very comfortable apartment , & as soon as Mrs E. 's civilities could leave her to herself , the happy occupation , the first Bliss of a Ball began . 
-- The girls , dressing in some measure together , grew unavoidably better acquainted ; Emma found in Miss E. -- the shew of good sense , a modest unpretending mind , & a great wish of obliging -- & when they returned to the parlour where Mrs E. was sitting respectably attired in one of the two Sattin gowns which went thro ' the winter , & a new cap from the Milliners , they entered it with much easier feelings & more natural smiles than they had taken away . 
-- Their dress was now to be examined ; Mrs Edwards acknowledged herself too old-fashioned to approve of every modern extravagance however sanctioned -- & tho ' complacently veiwing her daughter 's good looks , wd give but a qualified admiration ; & Mr E. not less satisfied with Mary , paid some Compliments of good humoured Gallantry to Emma at her expence . 
-- The discussion led to more intimate remarks , & Miss Edwardes gently asked Emma if she were not often reckoned very like her youngest brother . 
-- Emma thought she could perceive a faint blush accompany the question , & there seemed something still more suspicious in the manner in which Mr E. took up the subject . 
-- `` You are paying Miss Emma no great compliment I think Mary , said he hastily -- . 
Mr Sam Watson is a very good sort of young Man , & I dare say a very clever Surgeon , but his complexion has been rather too much exposed to all weathers , to make a likeness to him very flattering . '' 
-- `` I know nothing of my Brother 's Beauty , said Emma , for I have not seen him since he was 7 years old -- but my father reckons us alike . '' 
-- Miss Emma Watson puts me very much in mind of her eldest Sister , & sometimes I see a look of Miss Penelope -- & once or twice there has been a glance of Mr Robert -- but I can not perceive any likeness to Mr Samuel . '' 
`` I see the likeness between her & Miss Watson , replied Mr E. -- , very strongly -- but I am not sensible of the others . 
-- I do not much think she is like any of the Family but Miss Watson ; but I am very sure there is no resemblance between her & Sam . '' 
-- `` Your Father , Miss Emma , is one of my oldest friends -- said Mr Edwardes , as he helped her to wine , when they were drawn round the fire to enjoy their Desert , -- We must drink to his better health . 
-- He had lived long enough in the Idleness of a Town to become a little of a Gossip , & having some curiosity to know more of the Circumstances of his young Guest than had yet reached him , he began with , `` I think Miss Emma , I remember your Aunt very well about 30 years ago ; I am pretty sure I danced with her in the old rooms at Bath , the year before I married -- . 
`` I hope so , I beleive so , Sir -- said Emma in some agitation . 
`` I forget what her name is now ? '' 
I remember -- & she is gone to settle in Ireland . 
-- I do not wonder that you should not wish to go with her into that Country Miss Emma -- but it must be a great deprivation to her , poor Lady ! 
-- After bringing you up like a Child of her own . '' 
-- `` I was not so ungrateful Sir , said Emma warmly , as to wish to be any where but with her . 
-- said Mrs E. gravely , with a quick glance at her daughter ; -- and Emma had just recovered from her own perturbation in time to see a blush on Miss E. 's cheek , & in remembering what Elizabeth had said of Capt. Hunter , to wonder & waver between his influence & her brother 's . 
Emma drew her hand across her eyes -- & Mrs Edwards on perceiving it , changed the subject to one of less anxiety to all . 
-- A very stiff meeting between these near neighbours ensued -- & as soon as they were all duely placed again , Emma in the low whisper which became the solemn scene , said to Miss Edwardes , `` The gentleman we passed in the passage , was Mr Musgrave , then ? 
-- & Emma , who could not but watch her at such a moment , saw her looking rather distressed , but by no means displeased , & heard an engagement formed for the two first dances , which made her think her Brother Sam 's a hopeless case . 
-- Emma in the meanwhile was not unobserved , or unadmired herself . 
-- A new face & a very pretty one , could not be slighted -- her name was whispered from one party to another , & no sooner had the signal been given , by the Orchestra 's striking up a favourite air , which seemed to call the young Men to their duty , & people the centre of the room , than she found herself engaged to dance with a Brother officer , introduced by Capt. Hunter . 
-- Emma Watson was not more than of the middle height -- well made & plump , with an air of healthy vigour . 
-- Her skin was very brown , but clear , smooth and glowing -- ; which with a lively Eye , a sweet smile , & an open Countenance , gave beauty to attract , & expression to make that beauty improve on acquaintance . 
-- Having no reason to be dissatisfied with her partner , the Eveng began very pleasantly to her ; & her feelings perfectly coincided with the reiterated observation of others , that it was an excellent Ball . 
Osborne , her son Ld Osborne , her daughter Miss Osborne ; Miss Carr , her daughter 's friend , Mr Howard formerly Tutor to Ld Osborne , now Clergyman of the Parish in which the Castle stood , Mrs Blake , a widow-sister who lived with him , her son a fine boy of 10 years old , & Mr Tom Musgrave ; who probably imprisoned within his own room , had been listening in bitter impatience to the sound of the Music , for the last half hour . 
In their progress up the room , they paused almost immediately behind Emma , to receive the Compts of some acquaintance , & she heard Ly . 
-- Emma looked at them all as they passed -- but chiefly & with most interest on Tom Musgrave , who was certainly a genteel , good looking young man . 
-- At the conclusion of the two Dances , Emma found herself , she knew not how , seated amongst the Osborne set ; & she was immediately struck with the fine Countenance & animated gestures of the little boy , as he was standing before his Mother , wondering when they should begin . 
-- On the other side of Emma , Miss Osborne , Miss Carr , & a party of young Men were standing engaged in very lively consultation -- & soon afterwards she saw the smartest officer of the sett , walking off to the Orchestra to order the dance , while Miss Osborne passing before her , to her little expecting Partner hastily said -- `` Charles , I beg your pardon for not keeping my engagement , but I am going to dance these two dances with Coln Beresford . 
If the poor little boy 's face had in it 's happiness been interesting to Emma , it was infinitely more so under this sudden reverse ; -- he stood the picture of disappointment , with crimson 'd cheeks , quivering lips , & eyes bent on the floor . 
-- Emma did not think , or reflect ; -- she felt & acted -- . 
said she , holding out her hand with the most unaffected good humour . 
-- Emma with perfect truth could assure her that she could not be giving greater pleasure than she felt herself -- & Charles being provided with his gloves & charged to keep them on , they joined the Set which was now rapidly forming , with nearly equal complacency . 
It gained her a broad stare from Miss Osborne & Miss Carr as they pased her in the dance . 
-- Tho ' rather distressed by such observation , Emma could not repent what she had done , so happy had it made both the boy & his Mother ; the latter of whom was continually making opportunities of addressing her with the warmest civility . 
-- At the end of these Dances Emma found they were to drink tea ; -- Miss E. gave her a caution to be at hand , in a manner which convinced her of Mrs E. 's holding it very important to have them both close to her when she moved into the Tearoom ; & Emma was accordingly on the alert to gain her proper station . 
It happened close by Lady Osborne 's Cassino Table ; Mr Howard who belonged to it spoke to his Nephew ; & Emma on perceiving herself the object of attention both to Ly . 
O. & him , had just turned away her eyes in time , to avoid seeming to hear her young companion delightedly whisper aloud `` Oh ! 
-- Charles instantly pointed him out to Emma -- `` There 's Lord Osborne -- Let you & I go & sit by him . 
-- `` No , no , said Emma laughing you must sit with my friends . '' 
-- tho ' she felt that she had no better reason to give than that Miss Osborne had not kept it before . 
Among these was Mr Howard -- his sister leaning on his arm -- & no sooner were they within reach of Emma , than Mrs B. calling her notice by a friendly touch , said `` Your goodness to Charles , my dear Miss Watson , brings all his family upon you . 
Give me leave to introduce my Brother -- Mr H. '' Emma curtsied , the gentleman bowed -- made a hasty request for the honour of her hand in the next two dances , to which as hasty an affirmative was given , & they were immediately impelled in opposite directions . 
-- Emma was very well pleased with the circumstance ; -- there was a quietly-chearful , gentlemanlike air in Mr H. which suited her -- & in a few minutes afterwards , the value of her Engagement increased , when as she was sitting in the Cardroom somewhat screened by a door , she heard Ld Osborne , who was lounging on a vacant Table near her , call Tom Musgrave towards him & say , `` Why do not you dance with that beautiful Emma Watson ? 
-- I want you to dance with her -- & I will come & stand by you . '' 
-- `` I was determining on it this very moment my Lord , I 'll be introduced & dance with her directly . '' 
-- `` Aye do -- & if you find she does not want much Talking to , you may introduce me by & bye . '' 
If she is like her Sisters , she will only want to be listened to . 
I shall find her in the Tea room . 
-- Away he went -- Ld Osborne after him -- & Emma lost no time in hurrying from her corner , exactly the other way , forgetting in her haste that she left Mrs Edwardes behind . 
Emma was saved the Trouble of apologizing , by their being joined at the moment by Tom Musgrave , who requesting Mrs E. aloud to do him the honour of presenting him to Miss Emma Watson , left that good Lady without any choice in the business , but that of testifying by the coldness of her manner that she did it unwillingly . 
The honour of dancing with her , was solicited without loss of time -- & Emma , however she might like to be thought a beautiful girl by Lord or Commoner , was so little disposed to favour Tom Musgrave himself , that she had considerable satisfaction in avowing her prior Engagement . 
-- The stile of her last partner had probably led him to beleive her not overpowered with applications . 
The Gentleman a little disconcerted , could only hope he might be more fortunate another time -- & seeming unwilling to leave her , tho ' his friend Ld Osborne was waiting in the Doorway for the result , as Emma with some amusement perceived -- he began to make civil enquiries after her family . 
-- `` My eldest Sister is the only one at home -- & she could not leave my Father '' -- `` Miss Watson the only one at home ! 
-- Emma 's calm curtsey in reply must have struck him as very unlike the encouraging warmth he had been used to receive from her Sisters , & gave him probably the novel sensation of doubting his own influence , & of wishing for more attention than she bestowed . 
The dancing now recommenced ; Miss Carr being impatient to call , everybody was required to stand up -- & Tom Musgrave 's curiosity was appeased , on seeing Mr Howard come forward and claim Emma 's hand -- `` That will do as well for me '' -- was Ld Osborne 's remark , when his friend carried him the news -- & he was continually at Howard 's Elbow during the two dances . 
-- The frequency of his appearance there , was the only unpleasant part of her engagement , the only objection she could make to Mr Howard . 
-- In himself , she thought him as agreable as he looked ; tho ' chatting on the commonest topics he had a sensible , unaffected , way of expressing himself , which made them all worth hearing , & she only regretted that he had not been able to make his pupil 's Manners as unexceptionable as his own . 
-- The two dances seemed very short , & she had her partner 's authority for considering them so . 
-- Emma & Mrs Blake parted as old acquaintance , & Charles shook her by the hand & wished her `` goodbye '' at least a dozen times . 
Emma could not help missing the party , by whom she had been , tho ' in some respects unpleasantly , distinguished , & the two Dances which followed & concluded the Ball , were rather flat , in comparison with the others . 
-- Mr E. having play 'd with good luck , they were some of the last in the room -- `` Here we are , back again I declare -- said Emma sorrowfully , as she walked into the Dining room , where the Table was prepared , & the neat Upper maid was lighting the Candles -- `` My dear Miss Edwards -- how soon it is at an end ! 
-- '' A great deal of kind pleasure was expressed in her having enjoyed the Eveng so much -- & Mr Edwards was as warm as herself , in praise of the fullness , brilliancy & Spirit of the Meeting . 
-- A great deal of goodhumoured pleasantry followed -- & Emma went to bed in charming Spirits , her head full of Osbornes , Blakes & Howards . 
It was the way of the place always to call on Mrs E. on the morng after a Ball , & this neighbourly inclination was increased in the present instance by a general spirit of curiosity on Emma 's account , as Everybody wanted to look again at the girl who had been admired the night before by Ld Osborne . 
With some her brown skin was the annihilation of every grace , & others could never be persuaded that she were half so handsome as Eliz : Watson had been ten years ago . 
-- The morngpassed quietly away in discussing the merits of the Ball with all this succession of Company -- & Emma was at once astonished by finding it Two o'clock , & considering that she had heard nothing of her Father 's Chair . 
After this discovery she had walked twice to the window to examine the Street , & was on the point of asking leave to ring the bell & make enquiries , when the light sound of a Carriage driving up to the door set her heart at ease . 
She stepd again to the window -- but instead of the convenient but very un-smart Family Equipage perceived a neat Curricle . 
-- Not at all dismayed however by her chilling air , he paid his Compts to each of the Ladies with no unbecoming Ease , & continuing to address Emma , presented her a note , which he had the honour of bringing from her Sister ; But to which he must observe that a verbal postscript from himself wd be requisite . 
-- '' The note , which Emma was beginning to read rather before Mrs Edwards had entreated her to use no ceremony , contained a few lines from Eliz : importing that their Father in consequence of being unusually well had taken the sudden resolution of attending the Visitation that day , & that as his Road lay quite wide from R. , it was impossible for her to come home till the following morng , unless the Edwardses wdsend her which was hardly to be expected , or she cdmeet with any chance conveyance , or did not mind walking so far . 
`` I received that note from the fair hands of Miss Watson only ten minutes ago , said he -- I met her in the village of Stanton , whither my good Stars prompted me to turn my Horses heads -- she was at that moment in quest of a person to employ on the Errand , & I was fortunate enough to convince her that she could not find a more willing or speedy Messenger than myself -- . 
-- '' Emma felt distressed ; she did not like the proposal -- she did not wish to be on terms of intimacy with the Proposer -- & yet fearful of encroaching on the Edwardes ' , as well as wishing to go home herself , she was at a loss how entirely to decline what he offered -- Mrs E. continued silent , either not understanding the case , or waiting to see how the young Lady 's inclination lay . 
Emma thanked him -- but professed herself very unwilling to give him so much trouble . 
-- Still she hesitated . 
She enquired into the particulars -- & then said `` We shall be extremely happy Miss Emma , if you can give us the pleasure of your company till tomorrow -- but if you can not conveniently do so , our Carriage is quite at your Service , & Mary will be pleased with the opportunity of seeing your Sister . '' 
-- This was precisely what Emma had longed for ; & she accepted the offer most thankfully ; acknowledging that as Eliz : was entirely alone , it was her wish to return home to dinner . 
-- Emma was not more disposed to oblige him for all this . 
-- Emma said this -- tho ' against her conscience . 
replied Emma , to whom all this was cheifly addressed . 
You can imagine nothing more naive or piquante ; & What do you thing of LdOsborne Miss Watson ? '' 
-- '' Emma gave him no Encouragement , & he was obliged to keep his friend 's secret . 
-- He was also obliged to put an end to his visit -- for Mrs Edwards having ordered her Carriage , there was no time to be lost on Emma 's side in preparing for it . 
-- Miss Edwards accompanied her home , but as it was Dinner hour at Stanton , staid with them only a few minutes , -- `` Now my dear Emma , said Miss W. , as soon as they were alone , you must talk to me all the rest of the day , without stopping , or I shall not be satisfied . 
-- For the life of me Emma , I can not help feeling for those that are cross 'd in Love . 
-- '' Emma obeyed her -- & Eliz : listened with very little interruption till she heard of MrH . 
-- Emma concluded her narration . 
`` My dearest Emma ! 
-- He is no favourite of mine , as you well know , Emma ; -- but you must think him agreable . 
-- '' As their quietly-sociable little meal concluded , Miss Watson could not help observing how comfortably it had passed . 
-- Emma had not foreseen any interest to herself in the occurrences of a Visitation -- but when she heard Mr Howard spoken of as the Preacher , & as having given them an excellent Sermon , she could not help listening with a quicker Ear . 
-- Tho ' Emma could not but take the compliment of the visit to herself , she was very far from enjoying it . 
She felt all the inconsistency of such an acquaintance with the very humble stile in which they were obliged to live ; & having in her Aunt 's family been used to many of the Elegancies of Life , was fully sensible of all that must be open to the ridicule of Richer people in her present home . 
-- Of the pain of such feelings , Eliz : knew very little ; -- her simpler Mind , or juster reason saved her from such mortification -- & tho ' shrinking under a general sense of Inferiority , she felt no particular Shame . 
Osborne near Emma , & the convenient MrMusgrave in high spirits at his own importance , on the other side of the fireplace with Elizth . 
-- He was at no loss for words ; -- but when Ld . 
Osborne had hoped that Emma had not caught cold at the Ball , he had nothing more to say for some time , & could only gratify his Eye by occasional glances at his fair neighbour . 
-- Emma was not inclined to give herself much trouble for his Entertainment -- & after hard labour of mind , he produced the remark of it 's being a very fine day , & followed it up with the question of , `` Have you been walking this morning ? '' 
`` If they knew how much it became them , they would all have the inclination , & I fancy Miss Watson -- when once they had the inclination , the means wdsoon follow . '' 
Her manner had been neither sententious nor sarcastic , but there was a something in it 's mild seriousness , as well as in the words themselves which made his Lordship think ; -- and when he addressed her again , it was with a degree of considerate propriety , totally unlike the half-awkward , half-fearless stile of his former remarks . 
-- It was a new thing with him to wish to please a woman ; it was the first time that he had ever felt what was due to a woman , in Emma 's situation . 
-- But as he wanted neither Sense nor a good disposition , he did not feel it without effect . 
-- He was rewarded by a gracious answer , & a more liberal full veiw of her face than she had yet bestowed . 
Unused to exert himself , & happy in contemplating her , he then sat in silence for some minutes longer , while Tom Musgrave was chattering to Elizth , till they were interrupted by Nanny 's approach , who half opening the door & putting in her head , said `` Please Ma'am , Master wants to know why he be ` nt to have his dinner . '' 
-- He recommended Exercise in defiance of dirt -- spoke again in praise of Half-boots -- begged that his Sister might be allow 'd to send Emma the name of her Shoemaker -- & concluded with saying , `` My Hounds will be hunting this Country next week -- I beleive they will throw off at Stanton Wood on Wednesday at 9 o'clock . 
-- '' To say that Emma was not flattered by LdOsborne 's visit , would be to assert a very unlikely thing , & describe a very odd young Lady ; but the gratification was by no means unalloyed ; His coming was a sort of notice which might please her vanity , but did not suit her pride , & she wd rather have known that he wished the visit without presuming to make it , than have seen him at Stanton . 
-- The first circumstance to break in on this serenity , was the receipt of a letter from Croydon to announce the speedy return of Margaret , & a visit of two or three days from Mr & Mrs Robert Watson , who undertook to bring her home & wished to see their Sister Emma . 
-- An absence of 14 years had made all her Brothers & Sisters Strangers to Emma , but in her expectation of Margaret there was more than the awkwardness of such an alienation ; she had heard things which made her dread her return ; & the day which brought the party to Stanton seemed to her the probable conclusion of almost all that had been comfortable in the house . 
-- She was now so `` delighted to see dear , dear Emma '' that she could hardly speak a word in a minute . 
-- Emma scarcely knew how to answer such a proposition -- & the manner in which it was spoken , she could not attempt to equal . 
-- Perhaps Emma may be tempted to go back with us , & stay till Christmas , if you do n't put in your word . '' 
-- Emma was greatly obliged . 
-- `` Very much '' -- replied Emma , who thought a comprehensive answer , most to the purpose . 
-- She saw that her Sister in law despised her immediately . 
-- Mrs R. W. was indeed wondering what sort of a home Emma cdpossibly have been used to in Shropshire , & setting it down as certain that the Aunt could never have had six thousand pounds . 
-- `` How charming Emma is ! 
-- Emma was quite distress 'd by such behaviour ; -- & she did not like it better when she heard Margt5 minutes afterwards say to Eliz : in a sharp quick accent , totally unlike the first -- `` Have you heard from Pen . 
since she went to Chichester ? 
-- I do n't find she is likely to make anything of it . 
I fancy she 'll come back ` Miss Penelope ' as she went . 
-- '' Such , she feared would be Margaret 's common voice , when the novelty of her own appearance were over ; the tone of artificial Sensibility was not recommended by the idea . 
`` I hope you will find things tolerably comfortable Jane '' -- said Elizth as she opened the door of the spare bedchamber . 
-- `` I suppose , said Margt rather quickly to Emma , you & I are to be together ; Elizth always takes care to have a room to herself . '' 
-- `` No -- Elizth gives me half her 's . '' 
-- -LRB- in a soften 'd voice , & rather mortified to find she was not ill used -RRB- `` I am sorry I am not to have the pleasure of your company -- especially as it makes me nervous to be much alone . '' 
Emma was the first of the females in the parlour again ; on entering it she found her brother alone . 
-- `` So Emma , said he , you are quite the Stranger at home . 
`` But that would have been trusting me with money , replied Emma , & I am a woman too . 
-- `` My Aunt may have erred -- said Emma warmly -- she has erred -- but my Uncle 's conduct was faultless . 
I was her own Neice , & he left to herself the power & the pleasure of providing for me . '' 
-- `` But unluckily she has left the pleasure of providing for you , to your Father , & without the power . 
`` You know , replied Emma struggling with her tears , my Uncle 's melancholy state of health . 
Emma was glad when they were joined by the others ; it was better to look at her Sister in law 's finery than listen to Robert , who had equally irritated & greived her . 
-- To put an end to this altercation , & soften the evident vexation of her sister in law , Emma -LRB- tho ' in no Spirits to make such nonsense easy -RRB- began to admire her gown . 
-- As it happened however , he did not give more surprise than he received , when instead of being shewn into the usual little sitting room , the door of the best parlour a foot larger each way than the other was thrown open , & he beheld a circle of smart people whom he cd not immediately recognise arranged with all the honours of visiting round the fire , & Miss Watson sitting at the best Pembroke Table , with the best Tea things before her . 
-- He shook hands with Robert , bowed & smiled to the Ladies , & did everything very prettily ; but as to any particularity of address or Emotion towards Margaret , Emma who closely observed him , perceived nothing that did not justify Eliz . 
-- And I was so excessively impatient to see Emma ; -- I dreaded the meeting , & at the same time longed for it . 
I could never dread a meeting with Miss Emma Watson , -- or any of her Sisters . '' 
-- said Emma , who had caught her own name . 
-- Fine open weather Miss Emma ! 
`` Emma is delightful , is not she ? 
I have found her more than answer my warmest hopes . 
-- Emma could not help entering into what she supposed her Sister in law 's feelings at that moment . 
-- When the Teathings were removed , Tom began to talk of his Carriage -- but the old Card Table being set out , & the fish & counters with a tolerably clean pack brought forward from the beaufit by Miss Watson , the general voice was so urgent with him to join their party , that he agreed to allow himself another quarter of an hour . 
Even Emma was pleased that he would stay , for she was beginning to feel that a family party might be the worst of all parties ; & the others were delighted . 
-- '' said Emma , as they were taking their seats . 
I fancy you must have a little cheek-glowing now & then Miss Emma . 
-- Says Howard to Ld Osborne -- '' At this interesting moment he was called on by the others , to regulate the game & determine some disputable point ; & his attention was so totally engaged in the business & afterwards by the course of the game as never to revert to what he had been saying before ; -- & Emma , tho ' suffering a good deal from Curiosity , dared not remind him . 
-- Margt in the joy of her heart under circumstances , which she chose to consider as peculiarly propitious , would willingly have made a confidante of Emma when they were alone for a short time the next morng ; & had proceeded so far as to say -- `` The young man who was here last night my dear Emma & returns today , is more interesting to me , than perhaps you may be aware -- '' but Emma pretending to understand nothing extraordinary in the words , made some very inapplicable reply , & jumping up , ran away from a subject which was odious to her feelings . 
-- As Margt would not allow a doubt to be repeated of Musgrave 's coming to dinner , preparations were made for his Entertainment much exceeding what had been deemed necessary the day before ; and taking the office of superintendance intirely from her sister , she was half the morning in the Kitchen herself directing & scolding . 
-- T. Musgrave never came , & Margt was at no pains to conceal her vexation under the disappointment , or repress the peevishness of her Temper -- . 
& the maids cd never do anything right -- & Emma , whom she seemed no longer to think about , found the continuance of the gentle voice beyond her calculation short . 
Eager to be as little among them as possible , Emma was delighted with the alternative of sitting above , with her father , & warmly entreated to be his constant Compn each Eveng -- & as Eliz . 
loved company of any kind too well , not to prefer being below , at all risks , as she had rather talk of Croydon to Jane , with every interruption of Margt 's perverseness , than sit with only her father , who frequently cd not endure Talking at all , the affair was so settled , as soon as she could be persuaded to beleive it no sacrifice on her Sister 's part . 
-- To Emma , the exchange was most acceptable , & delightful . 
Her father , if ill , required little more than gentleness & silence ; & , being a Man of Sense and Education , was if able to converse , a welcome companion . 
-- In his chamber , Emma was at peace from the dreadful mortifications of unequal Society , & family Discord -- from the immediate endurance of Hard-hearted prosperity , low-minded Conceit , & wrong-headed folly , engrafted on an untoward Disposition . 
-- She still suffered from them in the Contemplation of their existence ; in memory & in prospect , but for the moment , she ceased to be tortured by their effects . 
-- She was at leisure , she could read & think , -- tho ' her situation was hardly such as to make reflection very soothing . 
The Evils arising from the loss of her Uncle , were neither trifling , nor likely to lessen ; & when Thought had been freely indulged , in contrasting the past & the present , the employment of mind , the dissipation of unpleasant ideas which only reading could produce , made her thankfully turn to a book . 
-- The change in her home society , & stile of Life in consequence of the death of one friend and the imprudence of another had indeed been striking . 
-- From being the first object of Hope & Solicitude of an Uncle who had formed her mind with the care of a Parent , & of Tenderness to an Aunt whose amiable temper had delighted to give her every indulgence , from being the Life & Spirit of a House , where all had been comfort & Elegance , & the expected Heiress of an easy Independance , she was become of importance to no one , a burden on those , whose affection she cd not expect , an addition in an House , already overstocked , surrounded by inferior minds with little chance of domestic comfort , & as little hope of future support . 
-- Elizth gave them her interest , tho ' evidently against her own , in privately urging Emma to go -- `` You do not know what you refuse Emma -- said she -- nor what you have to bear at home . 
-- '' Emma was of course un-influenced , except to greater esteem for Elizth , by such representations -- & the Visitors departed without her . 
Mr. Watson was soon to die ; and Emma to become dependent for a home on her narrow-minded sister-in-law and brother . 
She was to decline an offer of marriage from Lord Osborne , and much of the interest of the tale was to arise from Lady Osborne 's Doubtless a slip for Miss Osborne . 
love for Mr. Howard , and his counter affection for Emma , whom he was finally to marry .
