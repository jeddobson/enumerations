And Kate would look up from her studies and say , `` Another one already ! 
Then at other times there was talk , -- often above my comprehension , and where I could only amuse myself with the different looks and tones of the speakers ; with Kate 's earnestness and my father 's coolness , and with Mrs. Howard 's smile at them both and at my listening face . 
`` It is well you are a little younger than Kate , Gracie , or I should do nothing but answer questions . '' 
Stephanie Holbrook -- a somewhat quicksilver ward of my father 's -- was to spend our moving-time with her aunt , Mrs. Eustace ; and as Kate had not been well , it was agreed that she should go too and escape the confusion . 
Yes -- there was one exception , -- Kate and I had a farewell drive , and stood watching the quick feet of our receding ponies as they trotted round the corner , with a feeling of sadness that would perhaps have been deeper , had we known how many a long day would pass before their successors appeared at Glen Luna . 
`` It is good that we can keep our saddle-horses , '' Kate said with a half sigh , -- `` I should be sorry to think we should never mount Puck and Mopsa again . 
Mrs. Howard was too busy , and too anxious ; and Kate 's untutored foot tried too hard to keep step with my father 's . 
`` Do you suppose , Kate , '' she would say , `` that we shall have any occasion for kid gloves in the backwoods ? 
A very decided refusal of this last title was expressed by Kate without words . 
`` I shall not see many of them , '' was Kate 's cool rejoinder . 
From that chief one -- the parting with Kate -- the rest seemed to stretch away in perspective . 
I said goodbye to Stephanie and saw her get into the carriage , unmoved ; but when Kate ready dressed for her journey came down stairs , and pausing in the hall took one look at the drawing-room -- one last survey of the things we had loved and the place where we had been so happy -- I felt a degree of sorrow that surprises me even now ; and when she slowly turned away and passed out of the front door , I felt that we had quitted our home , -- the after dismantling would be a less matter , -- the crisis was passed . 
There I sat , hour after hour and day after day , with nothing to do , with no one to speak to : sometimes watching the carpenter bees , who thought our rafters were laid for their express accommodation , -- sometimes looking over at the misty Moon across the lake ; and then wondering wearily what Kate was doing , and whether she wanted me as I wanted her . 
`` Because papa is going to Kellerton to-day , and Kate and Stephanie will come home with him to-morrow ; -- and I do so want to make a fuss . '' 
`` There would n't be much fun , papa , -- and I have n't seen Kate in so long -- and one ca n't have bonfires by daylight . '' 
My hand was never ruthless in the matter of picking , but I could hardly pass by such beauties ; and with some late anemonies , an early wild lily , and corydalis flowers , I soon had enough to dress a vase to put in Kate 's room . 
Kate had seen the flag miles away , and had received all the messages that I sent my absent sister through its white folds . 
`` Why nothing , I suppose , '' said Kate rather dubiously -- `` only I was thinking of what Mrs. Osborne said , ` that nobody lived here . ' '' 
`` Uncle Ned does not think very much of his neighbours , '' said Kate , `` and who are ours , papa ? 
`` Mr. Collingwood is only a farmer , '' said Kate . 
WE were happily resting from our long turmoil , -- enjoying the sweet quiet order of everything in and about our new house ; and the summer 's luxuriance came wafted through the open windows , and Kate was trying her harpstrings , but softly as if half unwilling to lose the merry choir without . 
said Kate . 
said Kate when the note was despatched . 
`` I wonder if there will be any one else there , '' said Kate . 
`` Mr. Rodney , '' said Miss Bain the moment he returned , and pointing out a place somewhat antagonistic to Captain De Camp who was talking to Kate . 
`` Why sir , Kate brought a little white cat from Kellerton , and it cried all the time for a day or two , and Kate declared she would call it ` Mew ' ; and then I said if she did I would call mine ` Purrer-purrer ' . '' 
But that has n't been all the reason , Mr. Collingwood , -- since Kate came home I have had her to think of -- and you know I would rather hold her hand than the cat . '' 
`` O to be sure '' -- I said ; -- `` but you would if you knew her -- I forgot that you did n't , sir . '' 
said Kate . 
`` But papa , '' said Kate , `` do you think it will have a good effect on the men ? '' 
`` They wo n't respect you so much -- you need n't think it , '' said Kate gravely . 
said Kate the moment he was out of the room . 
exclaimed Kate . 
`` No indeed you must not , '' said Kate earnestly . 
`` Now Kate my dear , '' said Mrs. Howard with a smile , `` you may as well make the best of it . 
`` But mamma , '' said Kate , `` in the abstract you know -- do n't you think it is very bad policy for ladies to do such things ? '' 
`` You 'll never practise anything else '' -- said Stephanie when we were left alone , -- her own disapprobation having faded before the amusement of seeing Kate 's . 
`` Stephanie , '' said Kate , `` you ought not to try to aggravate my notions till you are sure they are wise and right , -- or until I am . '' 
Mr. Howard 's chief support in the farming line has given me the pleasing title of ` Miss Ste Fanny ' -- I am curious as to the probable cognomen of Miss Howard a few years hence , -- in most circles of society one might guess -- but here -- '' `` I hope Miss Howard will always be herself , '' said Kate composedly . 
`` She might easily be a better thing , '' Kate said , so gravely that Miss Holbrook took up her gloves and was silent . 
Even Mr. Howard had adopted the prevailing fashion , -LRB- to the dismay of Kate and Stephanie -RRB- ; and was now watching the irregular mowing of the Irishmen , which formed a strong contrast to the long , steady , and even sweeps of Ezra Barrington . 
`` Now papa , '' said Kate , `` doyou think it is well for a gentleman to go about with his coat on his arm ? '' 
`` I thought you were so very notional and particular , papa '' -- Kate said in a low voice . 
Stephanie shook her head , and Kate walked on with a grave look that seemed to say she could neither give up her own position nor attack my father 's . 
Kate looked better satisfied . 
`` I do n't believe you know any too much of it now , papa , '' she said with a laugh , -- `` I daresay Ezra Barrington was not pleased with your performance . '' 
My father looked at her for a moment as if her words had not quite pleased him ; but whether he had some feeling for the notions that were in such a fair way to be rubbed off , or whether he thought Kate might indemnify herself for a morning 's discomfort , he at all events left her remark undisputed . 
Resentment Mrs. Howard did not feel ; but she remonstrated and Kate argued , and Mr. Ned only laughed the harder . 
Kate said when we went up to dress . 
`` No dear , '' she answered smiling , -- `` they are anything but that . 
Stephanie , Kate , and I were alone in the study , having resigned the sitting-room to my father 's slumbers and Mrs. Howard 's letter-writing ; and as the gentleman saw us in passing , we admitted him by the private side-door near which we sat . 
`` It is very strange they should feel it as they do , '' said Kate , -- `` that so nice a point of honour should be more universally recognised among those wild tribes than in any civilized society . '' 
exclaimed Kate and I together , half answering half anticipating a gesture . 
`` Then you think , Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate , `` that Wolfgang is a sort of animated Baku -- with a perpetual fire in his head . '' 
`` Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate , as Stephanie left the room to see what a knock at the front door might announce , `` will you let me ask you one question ? '' 
`` And you must please to explain , '' said Kate . 
`` But Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate , `` I do n't quite understand -- we have n't got to the point yet . '' 
`` We all liked her very much , '' said Kate , `` she is so very gentle and pleasant . '' 
I felt the shade gather upon my own face , and as I instinctively drew near Kate and looked up to hers , I saw the shade there -- saw my own tears reflected beneath her drooping eyelashes . 
And we sat down in the gathering twilight hand in hand , and thought ; until I , weary with the unusual excitement of feeling , laid my head in Kate 's lap , and knew nothing more till I felt her lips upon my cheek , and heard her voice say that it was bedtime . 
So morning visiters were left to my stepmother and to Miss Holbrook -- who was sufficiently amenable to the charms of society -- and Kate and I kept ourselves as usefully busy as Mr. Howard could desire . 
In the afternoon we were of course altogether and saw whoever came ; and as Kate 's habits became better known it did seem that the late circle increased at the expense of the early one . 
At all events we had company enough to keep us from loneliness , and for the rest we amused ourselves with Kate 's harp , reading , flowers , walks , and the moonlight reflections in our lake , -- `` Luna and Luna '' as we called them . 
`` But if we are to stay here , mamma , '' said Kate one morning , `` we must at least go to town for a few days , to get winter dresses , and all that , you know . '' 
`` I know that , dear Kate -- we can not wear those -- but I think we can do without any . 
`` Yes , -- to be sure , '' Kate said ; `` but it seems very strange mamma , and I do n't quite see the reason of it . '' 
And Kate looked up with an air that quite rivalled Don Quixote in his defiance to windmills . 
`` I do n't care much about the thing itself , '' Kate went on , -- `` it is not that , -- but the principle , mamma -- the reasonableness . '' 
I shall like to see how you will beautify them , '' she added with a smile . 
`` How many things which I call impossible or wrong , you prove to be possible and right , mamma , '' said Kate . 
`` To be sure of doing that , '' said my stepmother , fondly passing her hand over the fair brow that was looking so thoughtful ; `` to be quite sure of taking the right view of things , Katie , one must always take the right stand , -- upon duty and not upon inclination . 
`` There is first ` Lady Howard ' -LRB- she shall be yours Kate my dear -RRB- , -- a beautiful frosted Durham : I think she 's the finest creature I ever set eyes on . '' 
`` That 's well , '' said Kate laughing -- `` I should n't like to have mediocrity bear my name . '' 
`` But my dear father , '' said Kate , `` who did help you with that list of names ? 
`` They both happen to be in Scotland , '' said Mr. Howard ; `` and as to the names Kate , the cows may have dubbed themselves for all hand I had in it . 
She 's a perfect beauty . '' 
said Kate . 
Then Kate and Stephanie and I laughed , and Mrs. Howard looked grave and then joined us , -- in which merry mood we finished dinner . 
said Kate . 
said Kate . 
`` Let 's call her Lady Bulger , '' said Kate laughing , -- `` which is both an expression of politeness to the Squire and of our hopes that the cow may grow fat . '' 
`` I 've heard of a soap-bubble , but -- why Kate what do you mean by stopping my mouth ? 
`` You may be glad they had both walked away , '' said Kate gravely . 
said Kate . 
`` Nonsense '' -- said Kate coolly . 
At all events , '' added she as we entered the hall , `` their caps are at rest on the hat-stand . '' 
Kate gave her one reproving glance , and then composing her muscles , gravely entered the drawing-room . 
`` Very fine , '' said Kate . 
O no , '' said Kate smiling ; `` I think it is very pleasant . 
The officers stared , and Kate and I were on the verge of uncontrollable merriment , when Stephanie changed her ground . 
`` Ishould think it , '' said Kate quietly . 
`` Miss Howard , '' said he turning to her , `` you have not seen the new Sulphur spring near the Moon , and the fine building that is being erected for the water-drinkers ? '' 
`` No , '' said Kate . 
`` I will go , in a minute , '' said Stephanie , -- `` and so will Kate -- of course . '' 
`` I should like to go , '' said Kate ; and then rather hesitatingly she added , `` but I do n't think I can . '' 
Mr. Howard vouchsafed no reply but an impatient glance , and then hearing Kate as she came singing down stairs , he walked off into the study and shut the door . 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , `` I have got myself into such a scrape ! '' 
Mrs. Howard really looked startled for a moment , as if my father 's last words might have been prophetic , but Kate went on . 
She was as good as her word , and before the next week Kate was provided with a sufficiently nice bonnet ; but at the expense of what fitting and trying on , sewing and ripping out ! 
said Kate . 
Kate read his thought more truly than he read hers . 
`` I never could understand , '' she said , `` why gentlemen feel so much amusement whenever they find or think they find , fear in a woman . 
The Captain was quite willing she should say more about his mistakes , but she did not . 
`` The gentlemen ought to know , sir -- '' said Kate ; -- `` if they do not , how can I ? '' 
`` Come here , '' said the lady referred to , as Kate somewhat unwillingly left the fine view down the lake ; `` come here and look at the room -- I think it is the pleasantest in the house . '' 
`` Not for me , thank you Mrs. Crown , '' said Kate , to whose eyes the appeal had rather been made . 
And thereupon Mrs. Crown gave it as her opinion that `` there was nothing in the house too good for some of the ladies -- certainly ! '' 
Now with Miss Easy , now with Mrs. Howard , first with his father and then with mine , -- then coming to my quiet corner to smooth down my hair and ask after my little felina , and once to bring me forward and find me a seat by Kate . 
said Kate , -- `` youto say that ! 
`` Yes and no , '' said Kate laughing ; `` but you must remember Mr. Collingwood , that I was almost an entire stranger , and -- '' `` And you see that your shot glances , '' he said with a smile , for Kate had stopped short in some confusion . 
`` It should , '' said Kate hesitating a little , `` there is nothing I love better , only -- '' `` Only the laws of etiquette forbid ? '' 
But I ca n't talk about it Mr. Collingwood , '' she added laughingly , `` for you will make some other side-application of my words , and be as far from my opinion as you were at first . '' 
said Kate . 
-- he answered with a look of keenness and amusement that rather indisposed Kate to answer . 
`` I am sure you think you would not agree with mine , '' said Kate laughing and colouring a little ; -- `` but Mr. Collingwood there arecases of minor importance , and in such what would you do with public opinion ? '' 
he said with a smile and a bright lighting of the eye , -- `` defer to it always Miss Kate -- where I could without compromising better things ; and where I could not -- give it to the winds ! 
`` You have got back to the more important things again , '' said Kate . 
But Kate had sprung up , and placing her hand before my father 's mouth she exclaimed , `` Now papa ! 
`` I do n't believe he knows himself , '' said my father drily , as he took hold of Kate 's hands ; then looking up , he told her smiling , that `` she might either stand there handcuffed or go back to her seat ; '' and having so dismissed all opposition , he proceeded . 
And these two silly girls came over -LRB- shall I say what for , Kate ? -RRB- 
Stephanie quoted Captain De Camp , and Kate gave me an abstract of other people and fairly charged me with having left off to be notional ! 
-- which from her lips is a grave imputation . 
`` Well Mr. Howard , '' said the Farmer with a very indulgent smile , `` you have taught us at least one thing -- there are no mistakes in Miss Kate 's temper . '' 
`` But papa -- '' I said , `` Kate did not mean that shethought so , -- only that other people did . '' 
`` O papa , '' said Kate laughing and stopping short at the door , `` I have an indefinite recollection of a gentleman who always writes a page after he is called to dinner ! '' 
We were soon ready , and leaving the other ladies in consultation with Mrs. Crown , Kate and I went back to the room where we had spent the evening and to the three figures standing before the fire . 
`` And so Miss Kate , '' said Farmer Collingwood taking her hand as she came up to him , and looking in her face with a very gentle amusement and interest ; `` and so you think that books must of necessity grow mouldy in a farm-house ? '' 
`` I have said nothing of the sort , Katie , '' said my father laughing , as her quick glance brought the accusation . 
said her questioner , still detaining her hand , but very gently . 
`` No sir -- '' said Kate . 
`` At least , '' she added colouring exceedingly . 
`` I should not venture to be anything else here , sir , '' said Kate trying to rally a little , -- `` Mr. Rodney will think I have profited by his lessons . '' 
Mr. Rodney walked first with his two companions , then Kate and Stephanie , then Mr. and Mrs. Howard ; while Wolfgang and I joined them all by turns . 
`` O Kate my dear ! 
said Kate . 
And Kate bent down over me and gave me , as she said , the last kiss for that year . 
But I think she gave me another when I was half asleep . 
`` But some might come , mamma , '' said Kate , `` and it 's just as well to be ready . '' 
said Mr. Howard pausing before the table where Kate had just placed it , and coolly helping himself to a macaroon . 
`` Now papa , '' said Kate putting her little finger in his buttonhole , `` will you pleaseto let my cake-basket alone ? 
-- `` And Kate makes three , '' concluded Stephanie not noticing the interruption . 
`` Kate is nothing but a rosebud , '' said my father looking at her fondly and arranging her hair after his own fashion , -- `` you need not put her in your grown-up class ; and as I am in no haste to have her gathered , the longer she stays out of it the better . '' 
Surely if there had been any Newyear 's folly in Kate 's head , my father 's words had quite cured it . 
Though by the way , Kate , if your father had n't been sure of it too , he would n't have said all he did . 
But Kate 's mind lay too high for the subject -- as a mountain-top rears itself pure and fair above the lower strata of clouds . 
Kate was served with a still fainter performance ; and when my turn came , Squire Bulger so nearly stood upright , and gave me so little but `` the season , '' that I felt not at all flattered . 
`` No , '' said Kate , who would have laughed if she had n't been vexed ; `` papa wanted some kind of a frame for cauliflowers , but the ground froze before it was finished . '' 
``` Scarlet 's asy seen at a distance , anyway , ' '' said Kate laughing . 
`` I should hope so , '' said Kate , -- `` spoils from such expeditions are not creditable . '' 
`` And pray , '' said Squire Suydam glancing at the book which lay by her on the causeuse , `` is it the fashion now Miss Kate to humbug gentlemen into the belief that you read between visits ? '' 
`` The last Philadelphia novelty , sir , '' said Kate laughing . 
`` I should think more of him if he had been a gentleman , '' said Kate with a cool misapplication of his words , -- `` I have no great fancy for savage heroes . '' 
So you like modern heroes best , Miss Kate ? '' 
said Kate looking up . 
`` You know Miss Kate , a hound was one of the three animals that entitled their owner to the name of gentleman , or nobleman . '' 
said Mr. Collingwood , -- `` are you looking for some Utopian corner of the earth , Miss Kate ? '' 
said Kate quickly , and then looking down a little abashed at the smile which met her words . 
`` Then you do not call Napoleon a hero , Miss Kate ? '' 
Sacrifices do n't pay , Miss Kate . '' 
Kate laughed , but did not seem disposed to take up the cudgels . 
`` Why Mr. Suydam , '' said Kate , `` do you think it is right to treat your friends so ? '' 
`` And do you Miss Kate , think it is right to leave a little old lady at home , all alone , and waiting for me ? '' 
said Kate -- `` even little things that at another time one would hardly notice . '' 
`` Thatis not much like Mr. Freeman , '' said Kate smiling . 
`` Why that will be good fun , '' said Kate , -- `` I should like to see them again . 
`` One body will , '' said I. `` And another , '' said Kate . 
`` So I thought , '' said Kate . 
said Kate . 
`` But I think you are all wrong , '' I said , -- `` the flag made methink of Kate , so it must have looked like her . 
said Kate , -- `` the plan is the work , to all intents and purposes . '' 
`` I do n't think the squirrel was so far wrong after all , '' said Kate -- `` seeing he did n't know any better , -- blue mountains are some of the most attractive things in the world . '' 
`` But Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate rather timidly , `` do you think aerial perspective is meant to serve no purpose ? 
And yet Miss Kate it is good sometimes to look through a telescope , -- good always to approach hope 's blue mountains with a mind braced for possibilities . 
Miss Kate , will you not give us the result of this long meditation ? '' 
`` But one can always use those powerful simples , encouragement and sympathy , -- and Miss Kate , '' he added gently , `` one oughtto know how to apply the catholicon . '' 
`` I do , '' said Kate . 
`` I know that very well , '' said he smiling , `` but remember too , Miss Kate , the sun is felt where he can not be seen . '' 
said Stephanie while Kate and I laughed . 
`` And perhaps come and see us in turn , '' said Kate . 
`` We do not need it in the least , '' Kate said , -- `` you need not take the trouble -- we can wait till we get home . '' 
`` It is no trouble Miss Kate -- you will be quite safe if you stand here . 
The child looked up at Kate , but did not open her lips except to smile ; and the answer she got was so very smiling and pleasant , that her next question was somewhat startling -- though spoken low as at first . 
Stephanie took her tumbler from her lips and laughed , while Kate reversed that action and blushed ; and Mr. Collingwood with perfect gravity gave our names in the order of seniority . 
said the child folding her hands together . 
I am sure Miss Kate forgave me . '' 
`` Only half , '' -- said Kate , looking up as if she meant to have her question answered , -- `` it was not morethan half out of good nature to me , Mr. Collingwood ? '' 
-- We had paused upon a rising ground to look back , and the farmhouse dell showed very fairly in the distance ; but now we saw a figure approaching the door whom we all recognized at once , -- indeed as Kate said afterwards , `` it could be nobody but Miss Easy . '' 
Mr. Rodney said nothing , he neither called our attention to the lady nor told us who it was ; but as she reached the door and went in , among the little troop that had rushed out to meet her , his eye wore a look of singular brightness and pleasure ; and so much of the glow remained when we turned again to our walk , that Stephanie lost patience . 
said Kate . 
`` PERHAPS you remember , Kate , '' said Stephanie one morning , `` that very wise and sententious remark that your father made the other day about the properties of man ? '' 
said Kate , without looking up from her book , -- `` yes , I should think it quite probable . '' 
`` Overdoses never kill , '' said Kate smiling , -- `` I should come out a hermit . '' 
`` I doubt if my life would , anywhere , '' said Kate . 
`` I never do , '' said Kate , -- `` a grain of salt is to my liking ; and no one ever found thatin dissipation . '' 
`` You are altogether too profound for my light reading , '' said Kate , shutting her book . 
To say was to do , and she went . 
exclaimed Kate -- `` you are filling up my beautiful strawberry patch ! '' 
`` There are n't strawberries enough , '' said Kate . 
The subject of country neighbours was not quite laid asleep , for in spite of Kate and Stephanie 's precautions we were exposed to a visit now and then which did not please them , -- sometimes dictated by curiosity , sometimes by policy . 
Mrs. Howard bore it all with her usual gentleness towards human nature in whatever form ; but Kate found it very annoying , and would fain have made the visits begin and end at the front door . 
Kate said at length . 
said Kate laughing -- `` I never saw you in such good order before , -- you have excessively the air of having just come from the ruffle woman . 
`` I would exasperate you in a minute , '' said Kate still laughing , `` if I only knew how -- at present I have not the slightest idea who you are . 
`` Very likely '' -- said Stephanie , -- `` I can answer for Kate ; -- but Grace my dear , I do not wish to have my fancy entangled among flowers and sunshine . '' 
said Kate . 
`` Do separate them , '' said Kate a little impatiently , `` and give us the short cut of this rigmarole . 
Kate laid down her work . 
said Kate , laughing in spite of herself at the cool demureness of the reply . 
`` But not to Mr. Freeman , '' said Kate -- with a most innocent rendering of her thoughts into plain English . 
said Kate . 
Kate -- do you perceive how completely unstarched I am ? '' 
Kate smiled a little but with a rather grave face , and went on taking stitches in the most abstracted manner ; while Stephanie as half in argument with her silence continued . 
But you know , Kate , Inever was strong-winged enough to ` follow such a flight , ' -- that is reserved for -- somebody else . 
`` Well , '' said Kate , `` as I do not know Mr. Freeman I can not congratulate you . '' 
Kate said -- then checking herself she folded up her work , and sticking the needle in it with unusual care , remarked , `` I will do all you wish me to . '' 
And now Kate , '' she said springing off the floor and laying her hands on Kate 's shoulders , `` I know every word you were going to say , and you are altogether right and partly wrong , -- which is a charming combination . 
When Kate and I had talked over this strange conversation with a mingling of sorrow and wonder , we went into Mrs. Howard 's room and gave her the benefit of it . 
`` Papa , '' Kate began the next morning after his return , `` do you know that Stephanie is going to be married ? '' 
`` No I do n't , '' he replied , facing round upon Kate as if he wondered how the subject got into her head . 
`` Then I have the pleasure of informing you , '' said Kate with a laugh at the gravity with which she was eyed . 
exclaimed Kate as he reached the door , `` you must n't tell Captain De Camp why you want to know about Mr. Freeman , -- you must be very careful . '' 
Do you think I am a fool , Kate ? '' 
If it were Kate , indeed '' -- `` Kate ! '' 
`` But papa , '' said Kate composing her face , `` you have n't told us about Mr. Freeman ? '' 
Kate and Grace what are you laughing at ? '' 
said Kate and I together . 
It so happened that Caddie Mc In -- the only specimen of womankind who then inhabited our kitchen -- knew about as much of the mysteries of flour and spice , as she did of botany and Epicurus . 
Therefore on that eventful morning , which , as Stephanie expressed it , `` would bring a coolness among the members of our family , '' Kate and I rolled up our sleeves and `` went but , '' as the Scotch say ; for we had declared that Stephanie should play visiter , and see neither Charlotte nor Soufflé till they were on the table . 
I was busily engaged before the kitchen window , introducing ladies ' fingers to the most intimate acquaintance with the Charlotte mould ; and Kate in the shade of the wall sat quietly mixing an odoriferous compound ; when a quick , frosty step made me look up , -- and there , just before my open window , stood Squire Brown . 
`` Well my dear , '' with a turn of the head that convinced me he knew where Kate sat and was trying to see her ; `` well my dear , has your father got through haying ? '' 
`` He did n't see you Kate , after all ! '' 
`` I suspect they are modernized copies , '' said Kate : `` at least according to Mrs. De Camp . 
`` Then I have n't made enough soufflé said Kate despairingly . 
she added advancing into the kitchen . 
We both turned and looked at her . 
Pretty , very pretty she always was , and that day especially . 
Excitement had given even neck and arms a slight reflection of her pink dress , but the prevailing tint was kept down by her gracefully arranged black hair ; while in her eyes the expression -- half dance half defiance -- which usually shone there , was softened by other feelings -- the new and the timid . 
I even fancied that her eyelashes were wet , and that tears lay hid behind them as she returned our earnest gaze . 
`` Well Katie , well Gracie , '' she said at last , `` what are you thinking of ? '' 
I saw the sigh that might not be heard , as Kate answered , `` I was thinking of you dear , -- how nice you look ! '' 
He sat basking in the light of Stephanie 's pink dress , far beyond all disturbance from trifles ; but Miss Holbrook herself was well disposed to give the aforesaid finger a rap over the knuckles every time she encountered it ; and if she sometimes forbore in deference to Kate 's look of reproof , it was only to utter an energetic aside about `` the Bain of her life . '' 
`` I do n't know whether I must put her among the few , '' he said -- `` I suppose in reality Kate is just like that little intruder over there . 
`` But it is n't Kate 's . '' 
`` Does she like Miss Kate better than you ? '' 
`` O no , but she wants to get on somebody 's lap , -- if I had been sitting still she would have come right to me . 
She likes Kate very much though . '' 
Purrer-purrer seated herself in front of Kate , winked once or twice by way of recognition , turned her head , winked once at me , and then with a light spring she reached the desired resting-place . 
`` My dear Kate ! '' 
`` Why I like her very much , ma'am , '' said Kate , while she stroked the pleased little pussy . 
`` But you should n't like her -- I ca n't bear to see you waste your young affections on cats . '' 
Kate smiled -- `` I should not give it that name Miss Avarintha , -- may n't we apply to one sort of charity what Bunyan says of the other ? 
said Kate , looking up with a mingling of displeasure at his and trust in her own position , so bright that it quite dazzled the Captain ; `` and how are they unclassical ? 
`` But how is it classical , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` I can not undertake to prove my assertion as well as defend it , '' she said laughing and colouring , -- `` I suppose one of the things Sir Thomas More would have said ` women had better notdo , ' may be to argue with superior information . 
`` O , '' said Kate , `` I do n't think one has a measured amount , which must lose in depth what it gains in breadth . '' 
`` And I that she had no mice , '' said Kate . 
said Kate smiling -- `` and I have no time for canaries and like cats better . '' 
`` Do tell me now Kate -- Miss Stephanie -- I 've seen so little of her -- is shealways of your mind ? 
or has she tastes of her own ? '' 
`` Of her own , '' said Kate , trying hard not to smile . 
`` Indeed she has , '' said Kate . 
Henderson and I were trying to pronounce upon the flavour of Mrs. Shelton 's , and we decided that it ` wath pomatum ' Miss Kate , '' said the Captain laughing . 
`` O that was only because gentlemen do n't know things by their right names , '' said Kate . 
`` I assure you Miss Kate you would have thought I knew the name of one thing , if you had tasted that ice , '' said the Captain . 
`` I heard of a gentleman once , '' said Kate , `` who asked a lady if her blancmange was flavoured with eye-water . '' 
But Kate disapproved that with a very decided little shake of her head . 
`` Why not , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` They may -- if they will only ask in the right way , -- and when they really need information , '' she said with a look that half applied her words . 
`` I only said it did not matter so much , '' said Kate . 
`` We were talking of things agreeable and things disagreeable , '' said Kate . 
said Miss Avarintha , while Stephanie enforced her words by a slight pinch on the back of Kate 's neck . 
`` He is talking to my mother , '' said Captain De Camp , `` but I suppose there is such a class as things agreeabler , Miss Kate ? 
The `` cook-book '' was lost upon the gentlemen , but Kate and Stephanie were fain to pat the cat . 
said Kate . 
`` Mr. Freeman , '' said Kate getting up and opening a cabinet , `` did you ever see these shells ? 
`` And will you tell me the same thing , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` No sir , '' she answered with light gravity , `` I know too little of them and of you , -- your taste may not lie that way . '' 
Kate laughingly set out a cold collation of `` olives '' and `` pigs , '' `` poached eggs '' and `` thorny woodcocks , '' which Captain De Camp immediately declared he should choose , -- `` he went in for utility . '' 
`` Well here is the ear of King Midas , -- and more useful still '' -- But Kate took the shell out of her hand with a glance which Stephanie did not see fit to disregard . 
`` What is that , Miss Kate ? '' 
The shell was immediately restored to the cabinet , and Kate bestowed her attention upon Mr. Freeman . 
`` But it does not spread nor move on , '' said Kate , -- `` it burns steadily in one place -- there went somebody 's roof ! '' 
`` Exit , '' -- said Stephanie turning from the window ; `` it was probably one of Mr. Collingwood 's favourite farmhouses , so if we go to bed at once Kate , I do n't doubt but we shall dream that we saved all the furniture except a tumbler . '' 
`` Nobody -- the light , '' -- said Kate drawing her breath , -- `` Dear mamma do n't look pale about it ! 
-- `` Surely mamma , '' Kate began , `` papa has not interfered with anybody 's rights ? '' 
`` I know nothing about it my dear -- some one has interfered with his , most certainly : but for the rest we must be in the dark till he comes home , '' she added sighing . 
said Kate . 
`` It seems strange that such a thing should affect us so nearly , '' said Kate . 
`` Only because I 'd rather not cry , -- one must do something , and Kate always says it 's folly to be worried . '' 
`` I fear she has not persuaded herself of that , '' said Mr. Rodney approaching her . 
`` Miss Kate , are you thinking of those blue mountains ? '' 
`` But she is only worried for papa , '' I said , `` and because mamma looked so grave . '' 
`` And you are troubled for her , Gracie ? 
said Kate softly . 
-- he said , but her words had struck deep , -- through all the clouds of doubt , weariness and vexation , clear to the very springs of life and duty , -- they rose at once , and after a few minutes my father breathed freer . 
`` O we will papa , '' said Kate . 
said mamma and Kate . 
said Kate . 
`` And mine , '' said Mr. Rodney ; `` but if I live to come back Miss Kate , you shall have at least such a one-sided account as Mr. Howard refers to . '' 
-- said Kate and I together . 
`` But if you take away the power of pain Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate , `` the power of pleasure goes with it . '' 
It was Sunday afternoon ; and Kate and I sat alone in our little tea-room , singing hymns , -- going over with a strange pleasure the bright hopes and anticipations which we had no share in . 
But at length Kate exerting all her self-command , looked up and thanked him in a few earnest words for what he had said , -- while I , whose feelings were less under control , dared not trust my voice . 
It was clearly our duty to go to church , therefore it was a duty to have bonnets and cloaks to go in ; and little as Kate and I cared about dress , it waspleasant to feel free to go where we wished , like other people . 
`` You wo n't have any time for pruning , papa , '' I said , `` breakfast is just ready , and here come mamma and Kate . '' 
`` But do not look grave about it , still , papa , '' said Kate ; `` perhaps it can be mended , if it is bad ; and at all events let us take things quietly . '' 
said Kate . 
said Kate . 
And with one look of joy and tears Kate and I had put our arms round each other ; for we too could see the distant light which shone upon my father 's sea of troubles . 
said Kate when they had at last gone to bed , `` how could you let those men come here ? '' 
`` Certainly , that may make it all right and necessary , '' said Kate ; `` but then papa you must allow that it is bad in other respects . 
Kate , I know it will do you good , and your husband will be here to go with you -- your father I mean , '' she added as the flush on Kate 's cheeks disentangled her thoughts , -- `` la , child , I never think what I 'm saying . 
Now Kate my dear , never be afraid to put a bow of ribbon in your hair , or under your collar here , '' -- she said , touching the little crescent which fastened the band of lace round Kate 's throat , -- `` or loop up your sleeves with it -- so , -- pink , if you like it , or blue would look well -- you have such white arms -- it 's so sweet and becoming . 
And if you want a dress a littlenicer than usual , '' said Mrs. Willet , while Kate 's face took for a moment an expression of proud and somewhat scornful self-respect , `` just get tarleton , -- it costs very little , and it 's the prettiest thing a young girl can wear . 
said Kate as the door closed . 
was Kate 's uncompromising reply . 
And if any style could have told Mrs. Willet as much , Kate would probably have adopted it for that evening , -- as it was , she had to content herself with the negative teaching of beautiful hair , in its usual quiet arrangement . 
She herself in a white turban , came forward from a circle of new and old friends ; and receiving us very graciously , carried off Mrs. Howard to the circle ; while my father gazed abstractedly at the bisque on the mantelpiece , and Miss Suydam called Kate and me to take seats by her . 
But Kate , not well pleased with such manifest manœuvres , sat in absolute gravity as two of the gentlemen laughingly placed themselves on either side of her ; while Mr. La Roche perceiving that a sixth place was not , folded his arms and taking a position in front of me , remarked , `` Well Miss Grace , I suppose I am to stand upand do the agreeable to you . '' 
`` My dear Kate , '' said Mrs. Willet while I was drawing comparisons , `` do go and sing us something -- there 's nothing so pleasant as music . 
`` No ma'am , I do n't think I could , '' said Kate gravely . 
And as Kate went to the piano , Mrs. Willet with a touch and whisper sent Mr. La Roche in the same direction , while herself flitted about observantly . 
`` You see , '' said Mrs. Willet turning again to my father , `` I sent him to turn over the leaves for Kate -- I wanted to see if it would disturb her . '' 
`` But Kate is one of thesepeople , '' I said laughing , `` and that is quite different you know , Miss Easy . '' 
`` And yet one can not help being amused , '' said Kate -- `` I 'm sure I have been . '' 
`` But Miss Easy , '' said Kate , `` you do n't speak -- do n't you like to see people ? '' 
`` I 'm sure I do , '' said Kate . 
dear Miss Easy , '' said Kate . 
`` Yes , '' she answered affectionately , `` I am what most people call old , Katie -- yes . 
`` I do n't know whether I ought to say hope or fear , '' she said , with a tone that had lost its bright cheerfulness . 
said Kate ; `` that last letter was grave , certainly , but was it more sad than usual ? '' 
She was right . 
`` But for Kate and Grace , I would say yes , in a moment . '' 
said we both , and Kate added , `` You know papa what does it signify ? 
Towards evening the wind lulled , and though snow-flakes still fell doubtfully and at intervals , Kate and I resolved to walk to the Bird 's Nest . 
One might have fancied that they sang , I think if they had really put the question Kate and I might have answered `` yes '' ; but with a chirp , and a flutter that showered the snow from its resting-place , the flock sprang to their wings -- if I may use the expression -- and we silently walked on . 
said Kate , -- `` simple , pure , and quiet as she is . '' 
We had long given up knocking at Miss Easy 's door ; so opening it gently , Kate and I passed in and entered the parlour . 
We recognised him at once , though with his head sunk in his hands , he sat like one whose thoughts are travelling painfully the long-quitted roads of former life ; but after one glance at him Kate and I looked at each other -- yes , it was Mr. Rodney himself . 
she said , `` where did you come from ? 
`` Yes , perfectly , '' Kate said ; and I looked up rather wonderingly and asked , `` Why ? 
`` And you see what a present I had , '' said Miss Easy looking with glistening eyes at her guest . 
I declare , '' said Miss Easy wiping her eyes , `` it quite touched me . '' 
And Kate and I , listening with charmed ears , noticed not the waning light , till Miss Avarintha and candles came in , -- then we started up in surprise at our own forgetfulness . 
`` Yes ma'am , '' said Kate , `` but we must take another time to hear the twenty things . 
`` No , but we are not going with you , Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate -- `` at least you are not going with us . 
I must go to the Lea to-night , Miss Easy , '' he added , turning to her , `` but you shall see me again in the morning . '' 
Perhaps Kate 's mind had taken the same course , for after a while she said , `` It is strange that the snow can not keep its lightness , even where there has been no heavy weight to press it down ! '' 
`` I was thinking of a time years ago , when we said the newfallen snow was like our own spirits , '' said Kate with a scarcely perceptible sigh . 
`` A little experience -- a little more of real life than we ever had before , '' Kate answered . 
`` Miss Kate , '' said Mr. Rodney , `` the snow will as you say lose its lightness -- will melt away entirely ; and yet the earth is thereby much more fertilized than if that reflector for the sunbeams were abiding . '' 
`` Yes , '' she answered , though her voice trembled a little , `` I know -- I feel that to be true . 
`` Forget it because I have so little of it , '' Kate said presently . 
said Kate as we reached our own door . 
said Kate . 
`` I should n't think he would care to live at the Lea then , '' said Kate . 
`` But Mr. Carvill is going to be married Kate , so you need n't even look that way . 
`` I am not at all allied to the kangaroos , '' said Kate . 
`` Nay we did not touch upon that species , '' said Kate , `` she is French then ? '' 
We were such a pleasant number as matters stood , -- mamma and I on one side , Mr. Rodney and Kate on the other : my father armed with the carving knife ; while opposite to him sat Miss Easy with a face of such pleased affection , that none but those who knew her well , would have guessed that she had always at least one thought upstairs . 
I felt reproved for my secret joy every time I looked at her -- get rid of it I could not . 
Quietly , soberly , as people who have tasted life must be , to be happy at all ; though with Kate and me the taste was half sympathetic , and in return the older members of the company caught from us somewhat of the smack of young pleasure that yet lingered on our lips . 
My stepmother went to see the sick lady after dinner ; and leaving my father and Mr. Rodney to finish their conversation , Miss Easy walked into the drawing-room again , followed by Kate and me . 
said Kate . 
`` My dear Kate , '' said Miss Easy then , `` what are you thinking of ? 
Kate left her stand at the back of Miss Easy 's chair , and kneeling down at her feet lent her face to her friend 's kind and somewhat thoughtful scrutiny . 
`` Well dear Miss Easy , '' she said , `` can your mind find the path by which mine came down ? 
`` Tell me where it came to and I will try , '' said her friend smiling . 
said Kate laughing . 
said the gentleman in question as he came up and placed himself in Kate 's former position behind Miss Easy . 
Kate hesitated . 
`` I was thinking -- I was wishing that I could ask you -- that you would tell us something about Bermuda , '' she said in rather a low voice , as if afraid of giving pain . 
`` I love to think of it Miss Kate -- it is very pleasant to me . 
`` I do n't know enough about it to ask questions , '' said Kate as she took the offered chair , while Mr. Rodney left his stand for one by the mantelpiece ; `` I have just a general idea of a group of islands east of the United States . 
You are so fond of this little inland lake Miss Kate , what would you say to a lake in the midst of the ocean ? 
said Kate . 
`` O Mr. Rodney -- '' I said , `` that is just what I wanted to ask -- those channels '' -- `` Are among the islands , '' said Kate , -- `` did n't you understand ? '' 
But Miss Easy said that Kate 's eyes were just like those channels -- except the reefs -- is there anything peculiar about them Mr. Rodney ? '' 
said Kate , who by dint of strong imagination had conjured up a visionary Bermuda in the fire , and was surveying it intently . 
-- then adding more quietly , `` if you knew me better Miss Kate , you would better appreciate my love of friends and home . '' 
`` There are a great many false notions on that subject , '' said my father suddenly pausing his steps by Kate 's chair ; `` I am glad they are not yours . 
`` You remember papa , '' said Kate , `` what Cotton Mather says of old Governour Bradstreet -- ` death seemed rather conferred upon him , than life taken from him . ' '' 
I say we -- I was not a woman , hardly was Kate that in years ; but sympathy and circumstances did the work of Time , -- mowing down spring flowers and ripening the grain . 
And Kate laid down her work and looked up earnestly . 
`` But how '' -- said Kate , and she stopped . 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , `` what do you think of giving up sugar ? 
`` It would n't save a great deal , dear Kate , '' she answered -- `` however , I am willing , but do n't tell your father . '' 
Miss Easy seemed quite taken aback by our asking if she knew of a place for Caddie . 
she said , `` yes ma'am , I thought you liked her so much . '' 
`` I do like her , '' said Mrs. Howard smiling , `` but I do n't want her . '' 
said Kate laughing . 
`` No , '' she said with a smile -- `` not all the why , -- I really want her on my own account . '' 
said Kate . 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , `` if she is such a sort of person it is not worth our while to call upon her -- she would not care to see us . 
`` You know if we are to have no servants we could not ask her here , '' said Kate colouring a little . 
`` If this were either -- '' said Kate . 
And there was no more to be said ; though as Kate remarked , `` her forgetfulness had been very natural , -- she had but looked at Mr. Carvill where he had put himself , and that was , outof his family . '' 
`` I have heard Mr. Rod-e-ney speak of you , '' she said with that deliberate accentuation which the voluble French sometimes give to our mother tongue , and perhaps meaning to explain the long stare with which Kate and I had been honoured . 
said Mrs. Carvill to Kate . 
`` Not often , '' said Kate smiling . 
Well , '' she added , coming back to her seat , `` it can not be that you like these person about here -- in what you call the neighbourhood ? '' 
`` Some of them I like very much , '' said Kate . 
said she with a shrug of the shoulders ; and with this hopeful remark we `` tumbled into a well , '' as Dickens has it . 
`` Miss Howard , '' said Mr. Carvill rightly interpreting the slight compression of Kate 's under lip , `` is the honour of amusing you due to Rodney or to me ? '' 
My father saved her reply . 
`` I have just been wondering , '' said Kate , `` whether you kill the woodcock for the same reason that you say you would kill yourself -- if you were condemned to their habitat . '' 
`` No sir , I do n't mean to say anything about it , '' replied Kate . 
`` You need not try , '' said Mrs. Carvill whose cold eye had watched the laugh with which Kate and I indulged ourselves , `` it is none of your affair . '' 
`` Do n't look dismal either , '' pursued her husband , -- `` well it 's a comfort to one 's philanthropy to know that handsome young ladies can exist and be happy anywhere . 
`` Kate , '' said my father suddenly , `` it matters very little to Farmer Collingwood now , that the waves of health and riches rolled from instead of towards him . '' 
that his ` day and night and summer and winter ' -LRB- they must succeed each other , Kate -RRB- were of just the right temperature and proportion ? '' 
`` I believe it had some effect , papa , '' said Kate , her eyes filling as she spoke , -- `` I would not change place with the Carvills for anything in the world , and yet there seems to be a great deal of comfort in the abundance of means -- the perfect freedom from all embarrassments . '' 
`` And never to hear of a judge or a lawsuit -- '' said I. `` Dear Gracie , '' said Kate , `` do n't think of them now , -- I am too glad to have you go away for a while beyond their reach . '' 
`` Kate is going to spend one day in Philadelphia with you , '' said my stepmother , -- `` you will like to go in her company ? '' 
`` But I wish she would stay longer -- why should she go for one day ? '' 
`` It will do her good , and we want sundry things that your father will have no time to get , -- if he attends that meeting of the -- Society . '' 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , `` was it for that he said his coat was not fit ? '' 
`` O Kate ! '' 
`` We have another , you know , '' said Kate , `` and the old one is not a good shape . '' 
`` But see , '' said Kate , `` perhaps papa will be able to give us the money again before long , and then we can redeem our fruit-knives , -- would n't you like that as well ? '' 
So it was settled ; and when I went to Philadelphia , Kate and the basket went too , and from the trunk it was speedily transferred to the jeweller 's counter . 
The coat is long since worn out -- the `` other things '' have disappeared , but the fruit-knives have not been heard of ; and Kate and I sometimes say to each other , `` our poor basket ! 
`` You may as well tell her at once mamma , '' said Kate the day after I got home . 
said Kate -- `` books , shells and everything ! 
But your father was away , and this man Jenkinson came with the sheriff and knocked at the door , and Kate let them in ; for we did n't know that we could do otherwise . 
said Kate , `` he had put on green spectacles that mamma might not recognise him ! 
From Miss Easy we carefully hid all our troubles , for she had been and was still unwell ; and though she would sometimes look earnestly at Kate and me as we sat by her sofa , and sometimes sigh to herself as if she saw or imagined too much gravity in our faces ; we generally contrived to be so very bright during the rest of the visit , that she at least did not question us . 
`` THEM 'S come Miss Kate ! '' 
`` Thank you ` Dency , '' said Kate , `` but what is the news ? 
`` Mr. and Mrs. Carvill Miss Kate -- they all come to the Lea last night , and forty ` leven servants ! 
Do n't it beat all , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` Hope you 're pretty smart , Mrs. Howard and Miss Kate and Miss Grace , '' said the good woman , who was really one of the best and kindest of our neighbours . 
`` Mr. Carvill is very fond of gunning , '' said Kate . 
But they say one of the ladies is the beautifullest singer Miss Kate ! 
she 's got the loudest voice you ever heard . '' 
`` Has she ? '' 
said Kate smiling . 
`` That 's what they tell me ; and Ezra says he guesses it 's true , for she 's always a singin and never leaves off that he can find out . 
Why Miss Kate it 's as true as can be . '' 
`` I do n't doubt it in the least , Mrs. Barrington , '' said Kate , whose gravity had fairly given way , `` but I could n't help laughing . '' 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , `` what comes next ? 
And the basket grows empty and the horse grows full , -- and the forestick breaks , and we arrange the fire by turns ; and Kate takes her irons from the left end of the row , and I mine from the right . 
Then enter Purrer-purrer , and jumping on Kate 's table she seats herself on a small pedestal of warm nicely-ironed pocket-handkerchiefs , and winks with satisfaction ; and being dislodged with sundry gentle pats , she takes to the clothes-basket , and purrs forth her eulogium of damp sheets . 
And she replies , `` Is n't it verystrange that the Carvills never came to see us ? '' 
And then the irons being too cool , I seat myself upon the corner of my table while Kate occupies a like position upon hers , and gently swinging one foot -LRB- for mere variety 's sake -RRB- we look at the fire and make little remarks , till Mrs. Howard calls from the other room , `` Gracie , what if we should have a potatoe-pie for dinner ? '' 
`` O I should like it very much ; but you had better make it Kate -- you are tired . '' 
And after dinner we dress , and Kate sings at her harp `` I had ae horse and I had nae mair , '' and then we walk down to the Bird 's Nest , -- that is Kate and I , for my stepmother is still busy at the shirts . 
`` Well , '' said Miss Easy with her cheering smile , `` and what have you been tiring yourselves with to-day ? '' 
`` Because it is n't necessary at all , '' said Kate , -- `` it do n't do us any harm . '' 
`` And she will work so hard at it , '' said Kate ; `` she irons up all the clothes away from me . '' 
`` And this is a very gentle trial too , '' said Kate , -- `` only a little bit of real life -- enough to keep us from being butterflies . 
Miss Easy smiled , but shook her head . 
`` It is strange , '' she replied , `` that we can not always rest satisfied with God 's dealings -- they are so surely the best that can be ! 
said Kate . 
`` It 's well he has an honest man to deal with , '' said Kate . 
said Kate . 
she said . 
`` No ma'am , '' said Kate , `` there was breakfast you know , and Mrs. Barrington ; and this afternoon I sang for a while , and Grace studied German . '' 
said Mr. Ellis turning to Kate with a smile . 
`` Very much , '' said she smiling in turn . 
`` Do you know Italian Miss Kate ? '' 
Kate coloured a little -- `` I thought it would be of no use to me sir , and I parted with all my Italian books . 
`` And often justly , '' said Kate . 
Christians should give the world no handle , no occasion of reproach : and therefore Miss Kate I would set very wide bounds to the field of knowledge , and go over it in full career , -- being careful always not to encroach upon higher duties . 
`` You would have liked Whitefield Mr. Ellis , '' said Kate , -- `` you know he is said to have been so particular about everything , that even when dining quite alone , he would care for the whiteness of the cloth and the line-and-rule arrangement of the dishes . '' 
I do n't remember to have met with that ; thank you Miss Kate for furnishing me with such a precedent ; I am exactly of his mind . 
said Kate . 
`` Yes it is , '' said Kate , -- `` if you fold up a black sheet of paper it will look very dark indeed ; but open and hold it before our faces papa , it wo n't be more than grey at the most , and who knows what bright specks may appear ? '' 
said Kate , for my stepmother sat silently looking at the little fire which sighed and flickered like our waning fortunes . 
The law is an excellent battery for gold and silver , Kate ; but it 's rather too strong to be played upon poor flesh and blood that has lost its wall of defence . 
said Kate smiling . 
`` But papa , '' said Kate , `` wo n't you try to get somebody else ? 
So in reply to Kate 's request he only laughed and said , `` Do n't libel your sex , my dear -- I should be sorry to think all old women were like Adam McKee . 
My father went off , and Kate and I assumed bonnets and baskets , and with Andy for escort began to thread the woods , -- keeping carefully to our own grounds however . 
said Kate . 
`` But see , Miss Kate , there 's the chestnuts sure ! 
said Kate . 
`` Never mind the chestnuts , '' said Kate . 
Leaving Andy to transfer these to his basket , and to refresh himself with cracking and eating , Kate and I sat down upon a lichened rock , and took in our refreshment at eye and ear . 
said Kate , with that half sigh that comes from the hidden recesses of enjoyment . 
`` We often have hazy weather in October , '' replied Kate . 
Mrs. Howard hesitated , but at last gave her consent upon condition of Kate 's bearing me company , and we set forth with the basket between us . 
said Kate . 
`` Why child you need not look frightened , '' said Kate ; `` do n't you suppose papa knows enough to take care of himself ? '' 
called Kate . 
`` I do n't know , '' said Ezra , looking at his hands as Kate offered him a sandwich , `` my wife says ashes is clean dirt , but I 'd like to hear what she 'd call t ` other ! 
The weather was so fine , that after they had gone Mrs. Howard and Kate and I , took books and work , and went to spend the morning out of doors : choosing for our retreat a little thicket which was open enough to admit the air 's freshness , while yet it sheltered us from the sun . 
`` As your memory is so good , Mr. Carvill , '' said Kate , `` wo n't you please to remember where our house is , and to keep as far from it as possible in future , when you are shooting ? '' 
exclaimed Kate . 
Thither we followed her , but more leisurely ; and Mr. Rodney assuming at least an appearance of cheerfulness , asked Kate and me to take a walk with him . 
But Kate presently recollected it . 
`` Mr. Rodney , '' she said when we were a little way from the house , `` what were you all talking about when we came down ? 
`` Will you forgive me Miss Kate , if I do not answer you now ? '' 
`` I suppose I shall have to , '' said Kate laughing -- `` happily curiosity is not one of my ruling passions . 
`` Mr. Rodney , '' said Kate , `` if I thought you would not be displeased , I should advance an opinion . '' 
-- `` I agree to that perfectly Miss Kate -- with this slight qualification : one has as good a right in fair weather as in foul . '' 
said Kate with the kind of look that the sun sends through a fog . 
`` This is one of the prettiest of our wild shrubs , '' said Kate , as we broke off some of the twigs that displayed alternately their bright yellow flowers and large brownish yellow leaves . 
`` And yet , '' said Kate , whom I half suspected to have a secret purpose in what she said , `` and yet Mr. Rodney if I could tell -- if I were sure of happiness to-morrow , to-day 's grief would not so much affect me . '' 
His eye had brightened and his brow cleared , and Kate 's smile as she turned from the bush and went on , made me sure that I had guessed right . 
`` Here is somebody who has got used to several things , I should think , '' said Kate . 
`` Apparently she has not your ideas of self-esteem Mr. Rodney . '' 
`` Certainly , '' Kate said , in a tone of such quiet good-breeding as sounded strangely after Miss Brown 's rattle ; and for which she was rewarded by as many examining looks as that lady could spare from her older acquaintance . 
`` Confess that you are out of patience , for once , '' said Kate laughingly as we overtook him , -- `` but Mr. Rodney , there is no one left in the road to run away from now . '' 
`` Nor I , '' said Kate ; `` but perhaps you are ? '' 
He said ` he guessed Mr. Carvill would have felt cut up , if he had seen Miss Kate and Miss Grace sitting on the stones and looking at the fire . ' 
said Kate . 
`` I think you are wrong , Mr. Rodney , '' said Kate , `` she may be just carried away by her own flightiness . 
`` My dear Miss Kate if you were anywhere near that , I am afraid I shouldtell you all I think of it , -- more perhaps than I have any right to . 
I said , -- `` look Kate -- this little round place at the foot of the pine tree , with the branches hanging all over it . 
`` We have had such a pleasant walk , '' Kate and I said as we shook hands with him . 
-- I do not know -- there seems a mist over that day when my father came in from his walk and told us , what she herself had said : that the life-current of the best friend we had at Glen Luna , would perhaps not last out the tide of that swift-running year . 
Yet still Kate and I hoped ; in spite of the grave certainty on my father 's face -- the steadfast sorrow on Mrs. Howard 's ; with a hope that Phœnix like , died and sprung up again from its own ashes . 
`` I wish you would let us stay here all the time , dear Miss Easy , '' said Kate . 
`` We love to be here , '' said Kate softly ; and I looked up and added , `` Very much ! '' 
-- and Miss Easy smiled her belief of our words , but still repeated , `` Not at present . '' 
how happy to want her bustling attentions ! 
and though Miss Easy never said as much , we were sure she thought it . 
Indeed she could hardly help feeling the different manner in which my stepmother did everything ; for putting heart out of the question , Mrs. Howard was perfect in that very point where Miss Bain was most deficient -- `` the not too much . '' 
and by such counsels and example , Kate and I became as Miss Easy declared , `` the two best little mice she had ever seen . '' 
And then after an early breakfast , Kate and I would have a quick frosty walk in the morning air , to find my stepmother at her friend 's side , reading or talking in a voice that carried comfort with it . 
Many a time did Kate and I go weeping home , after one of those long looks of affection from Miss Easy , so full of sympathy for our trembling words , so unshrinking , so undoubting for herself . 
We had gone rather late to the Bird 's Nest , hoping first to get some message ; for without this the walk was always one of painful forebodings : but no message came , and not willing to wait longer Kate and I set out . 
We could not breathe freely in that perfect stillness ; and as we passed the white curtains -- hanging listlessly and unlooped-up now -- our steps were quickened , and I saw Kate 's hand pressed upon her heart , as if to silence that too . 
She appeared to be half sleeping , and with more weariness and prostration in her attitude than we had ever seen -- the position of the very fingers seemed involuntary . 
She was a little raised up , supported by pillows , and my stepmother 's gentle hands had arranged her hair , and tied over it one of those handkerchiefs which it had become second nature to wear ; and a very slight motion of the fringed ends was the only token that breath yet came through the parted lips . 
said Kate after another pause . 
Another short silence , and then without opening her eyes , Miss Easy said , `` Sing to me . '' 
In vain Kate strove -- the words would not come unless tears came with them ; and then , thoughtfully kind as ever , Mr. Rodney gave us time , and himself began the hymn . 
And hastily going down stairs Kate and I went into the little parlour , and wept out all the smothered feelings of that afternoon . 
-- she spoke true . 
When we met my stepmother in the morning there was no need to ask tidings -- they were written on her face . 
It was there to the last , -- the soul 's own gilding on its broken temple -- the written receipt of all the blessings to which she had looked forward . 
The same golden light , the same soft haze , the same sun sending his slant beams over the Brown bluff ; while along the little path that wound about its base , rising and falling with the broken ground , went the little train of dark figures . 
For Kate and I still loved to go there , and to look up at the windows and imagine the light that once came from them ; and never did we leave the little far-off church , without going to the one spot near it that we loved best . 
I leaned forward to look at Kate . 
She sat on a low seat at the other side of the chimney , her head bent down and resting on her knees ; but though absolutely motionless I felt sure she was awake ; and though the firelight shone but upon the hand that shielded the side of her face , it seemed to me that I read its look , even in those very closed fingers . 
I knew with what steady , sobering effect our changed circumstances had wrought , in spite of the young life that had often rebelled against it , -- I knew how very deeply she had felt this last sorrow , -- and I thought of her in our old parlour in Philadelphia , and then as she was soon after she came to the Glen , when she talked with my father about our neighbours ! 
How little her attitude now spoke of that touch of pride which my father had called her only fault ! 
But surely the pride had taken other things with it , -- I could not look at her for a while -- it grieved me . 
She had not stirred when I again turned my head ; but as I watched her , a slight motion at her side caught my eye , and as the fire blazed up I saw Wolfgang 's paw , stretched out and lying upon her dress . 
`` And as Grace says , '' remarked Kate , `` perhaps Wolfgang will get tired of us . '' 
Kate and I had determined that the little rose-hedged garden should not be left to utter desolation -- we could not bear the thought . 
`` O no , we ca n't do that , '' said Kate ; `` we are only making it look a little nice . '' 
`` But you have n't time , '' said Kate . 
Miss Kate , '' he added energetically , and surveying the little patch of ground with great contempt , `` why if I had a team in here , I 'd put through it afore you could say gee ! '' 
said Kate smiling . 
`` Miss Kate , '' said Ezra one afternoon , as he gave the last blow to a support for a Lady Banks rose , `` I hope there ai n't much of the cat about me , as is always lookin into other people 's cupboards ; but do n't you think this here garden could live along without you for a spell ? 
`` Why yes , I suppose so , '' said Kate looking at him inquiringly . 
said Kate . 
`` If you 'd asked me where he would n'tbe Miss Kate , I could ha ' telled ye , and that 's to home , -- walk over there any time o ' day when you 'd calculate to find him , and ` tai n't likely you will . 
He ai n't quite a coon yet neither -- so I thought likely he might take you and Miss Kate for pigeons . '' 
After a chill , cloudy day which had persuaded us to remain in the house , a few late sunbeams struggled forth , and Kate and I ran out to enjoy them . 
`` Yes , for the present , '' Kate said . 
`` No sir , '' Kate answered quietly , but with no concession in her voice . 
`` I hope fewer than that will content you Mr. Carvill , '' replied Kate in the same cool and quiet manner . 
The smile with which Kate had greeted Wolfgang 's reappearance in front of her , gave place to a somewhat bright colour , but she made no reply . 
said Kate as she turned and confronted her tormentor . 
With such an air of deference too , of admiration , of amusement -- it was hard to tell whether he was most glad to have roused her or most vexed that she had thwarted him . 
Kate hesitated , and the sparkling glance of her eye spent itself upon a tuft of violets . 
`` Nothing you can say sir , will make any difference , '' she went on , -- `` I wish you would understand that , once for all . '' 
`` Because I am tired of the subject , '' said Kate , `` and do n't mean to talk about it any longer . '' 
said Kate ; `` he is to stay with us till Mr. Collingwood comes for him . '' 
`` But papa , '' said Kate , `` you know we are never sad nor cast down if you are not ; and as you told me once these are but trifles -- just think how well we are , and how happy , in spite of it all . 
And as to being checkmated , '' she added smiling , `` the queen can make any number of diversions , and Grace and I are the willingest of all little pawns , -- it would be a wonder if we could n't uncheckmate ourselves papa . '' 
And bringing the little hand appreciatingly to his lips , my father looked brightly towards Kate and me ; and our tears were not the less ready that their source was sweetened . 
`` O papa , '' said Kate as he reached the door , `` what if you were to take a basket and bring us some eggs ? '' 
said Kate . 
She walked to the window and stood looking out . 
`` Katie , '' I said following her , `` do you feel disposed to go with me to the peach-trees now ? '' 
`` Yes I will go , '' she said ; `` but here is another of the small delusions poor people are under . 
`` My dear mamma , '' said Kate laughing , `` pray do n't be sorry that I must do something I do n't like -- it 's very good for me , -- what I care most about is that I ca n't do something I like better . 
said Kate . 
-- I wish you had my dislike of exclamation points , Kate . '' 
`` But you see papa , '' I said , `` she has tired herself with the peaches this morning , and we were thinking that perhaps you would find somebody that could do it . '' 
`` I will before long , '' said Mr. Howard , taking her hand in his . 
`` It has n't hurt us papa , '' said Kate , her eyes giving quick answer to his change of tone . 
`` A good reason for being always patient , Kate -- even when one is left by a stage-coach . 
said Kate . 
said Kate . 
Kate laid down her work . 
`` You could not do it so easily papa ; '' and with a whispered word or two that brought her cheek very near his , she passed on to the other end of the room ; while even Mr. Mulhawl drew up his foot out of her way and Mr. Self had nearly risen from his seat ; and the posse looked shy when she turned to them and said , `` I will show you the things now . '' 
And leading the way with as much composure as if they had been invited guests , she pointed out the cabinet of shells to their inspection , and stood waiting their readiness to go further ; but her eye had gone out of the window then , to the fair blue sky beyond ; and her thoughts were very far from the unscientific debate at her elbow . 
I dared not look at mamma and Kate , but I stood by him and said , `` I will do it papa . '' 
Then came sofa and tables , and then Kate pushing aside a large easy-chair brought the appraisers face to face with Hebe . 
Mr. Boggs shook his head dubiously and glanced towards Kate as if inclined to ask in his turn , but she gave no encouragement . 
By the time Kate had taken them upstairs to try their ingenuity upon beds and bureaus , I had finished my copying , and my father and Mr. Cross took the lists to compare them . 
Kate and I carried the copy list upstairs to Mrs. Howard , and then went back and forth with her decisions and suggestions . 
As Kate said , `` It was a blessed thing all the world were not like some of it . '' 
said Kate , `` unless they 've a mind to break the house down ! 
Then there was another long talk , finished off by a question from Kate as to whether `` any one else could do anything ; '' and the somewhat dubious reply from my father that `` he hoped not . '' 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate just as they were setting out , `` Grace and I thought of going to the Bird 's Nest -- do you think we may without you ? '' 
said Kate coming up to me and taking my face in her hands , `` how tired you are to be sure ! 
So I lay down , and Kate covered me up ; and for some time I watched her as she sat on a low seat reading , with the afternoon sun glancing across her head -- her only extrinsic ornament . 
The sun had long left the horizon when I awoke , and in its place the firelight shone darkly upon Kate as she knelt before me . 
`` Gracie , '' she said , `` are you quite determined not to wake up ? 
`` That was rather odd , '' said Kate smiling . 
said Kate as she laid her cheek against mine -- `` what put such a dream into your head , love ? '' 
`` There is no particular need of your losing everything , even in imagination , dear Gracie , '' she said . 
`` Ah I am not asleep now to suppose any such thing -- I 'm in the full possession of all my senses Miss Kate , '' I said , stroking back her hair . 
`` Thank you dear Gracie , '' he answered , `` I am very glad to see you . '' 
`` I do n't believe I could , '' he said with a smile , -- `` except that I came while you were asleep . '' 
It is Mr. La Roche -- do n't you remember Kate Mrs. Willet said he should bring back your book ? '' 
said Kate laughing . 
`` Singular mood we are all in to-night -- Mrs. Howard talkative , Mr. Rodney meditative , Kate speculative , and Grace sportive -- if one may judge by her face . 
said Mrs. Howard , after a glance of entreaty at my father ; while the new comer laid the book on a side-table behind Kate . 
and how Kate said there might be good things in him ? '' 
`` Very likely , '' said my father replacing the tongs , `` but I presume Kate has found out by this time that my first estimate of people is quite as apt to be right as hers . 
`` Come sing with me Gracie , '' Kate said . 
`` Yes papa , '' said Kate laying down a shirt-collar and exchanging her needleful of thread for one of silk . 
Kate sat leaning forward with the tulip fingers abstractedly piercing the air . 
Why Kate ! 
`` Better than spending it in this way , '' said Kate again displaying the glove -- `` and we need not do it too steadily , -- it ca n't harm us if we take exercise enough . '' 
said Kate . 
Mrs. Suydam has not been here this spring -- to be sure she is not very well -- and neither has Mrs. Egerton ; and Mrs. Willet came but once in all the last year ; and I do n't believe , '' said Kate laughing , `` that Mrs. De Camp recollects where we live . '' 
I dropped the cravat and Kate paused with uplifted needle , and we both declared it would be `` dismal ! '' 
`` I never would do that , '' said Kate -- `` I had rather be a governess and have the comfort of thinking that the rest of you were enjoying yourselves . '' 
And laying down her work Mrs. Howard rested her head on her hand in an attitude of rather sad thoughtfulness . 
`` But my dear mamma , '' said Kate , `` how many pupils do you suppose it would take to support us ? 
we wanted to make some cake for Kate 's birthday , -- but if it is not convenient , never mind . 
And for the same reason Kate I did not bring your shoes . '' 
said Kate , `` you never would have thought that adding water to that thin soap would make it thicker . '' 
Kate replied with some difficulty that `` she really could not tell . '' 
said Kate , with a sudden recollection of that antidote for alcohol . 
Kate hastily went for some , and he drank it with a look that seemed benignly aware of her intention . 
The somewhat eager eye with which Candlish had first looked up at us , became singularly trustful ; and before the evening was over he was on my stepmother 's lap , as in a very sure and tried resting-place ; while Archie detailed to Kate and me some intricate fishing operations in which he had lately been engaged , with no doubt of our sympathy . 
It was `` Miss Kate couldyou show me about this problem ? '' 
Kate and I walked and talked and listened till we were tired , -- no such blessing ever befell the two boys . 
`` Did you ever hear that old proverb , '' said Kate looking up , `` which says , ` the way not to have a thing known of you is never to do it ' ? '' 
`` Now Miss Kate ! 
Kate and I look at each other , and for a little while feel stunned . 
-- just this second verse , -- it begins , But Kate laughingly stopped his mouth and declared he should not go on . 
We paid dear for our popularity , for it having been once discovered that `` Miss Kate could explain everything , and that `` Miss Grace knew where everything was , '' besides being a sort of conjuror in the way of knots and difficulties ; all knots and difficulties whether physical or mental were brought home to us . 
We were out walking one afternoon , and the two boys had been excursionizing to their heart 's content , when Archie came up with , `` O Miss Kate ! 
Kate and I stood looking out when the sun had hid his face behind the woods , and a little train of gold-coloured clouds were reversing the custom of French courtiers , and quitting their master without the `` grand coucher . '' 
`` Dear Kate ! '' 
said Kate smiling . 
`` Yes , '' -- she said with a quick change of colour . 
said Kate leaning her head upon mine . '' 
And seating her before the fire , I stood behind her playing with her hair while she read . 
She had not finished when Mr. Howard called me to look for something he wanted , and it was some time before I could return to the sitting-room . 
Kate was alone there still , in the easy-chair with her back to the window . 
She was leaning her head upon her hand ; but as I came up she put one arm round me , and drawing me down to her lap made my head the resting-place for hers . 
`` Well , '' I said , putting my arms about her in turn , `` do n't you think I am a fine dreamer ? 
She made me no answer , except by laying her lips instead of her cheek upon my forehead . 
I said sorrowfully , for I felt that my forehead was wet with her tears . 
she said after a while , -- `` it made me think that you love me a little too much Gracie -- that was all . '' 
`` Do n't you make yourself sad with thinking of anything , '' said Kate kissing me . 
`` Now what harm does it do , Miss Kate ? '' 
Archie would say , -- `` and it 's such fun to see her put round the house . '' 
`` The cat , sir -- I say it 's such fun to see her put round the house . '' 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate one morning as we sat at work , `` are we making any headway by means of this teaching business ? '' 
`` I shall have to go back to my old plans , '' said Kate , -- `` we must get some maps to colour . 
said Kate patting him , `` why do n't you lie still ? '' 
He gave her such a smile as a dog could , and lowered his ears in acknowledgement of her hand ; but in a moment they were raised again , and with one bound he was at the door . 
It was with a changing expression of face that he looked on as Candlish came bounding into the room , and then subsiding a little at sight of the stranger knelt down by Kate , with a whispered entreaty that she would explain something . 
The seat next her was taken in a moment , and gently withdrawing the book from her lap , Mr. Rodney said , `` Suppose you let me play the part of assistant for to-day . 
`` Miss Kate can explain it , indeed sir . '' 
`` But is n't it a possible thing for Miss Kate to get tired ? '' 
`` I do n't believe she ever got tired helping me , '' said Candlish affectionately . 
`` She has n't had a chance to-day , '' said Kate as she held out her hand for the book . 
But Mr. Rodney gave her no answer except a smile ; and with one arm drawing the boy a little nearer to his side , he again inquired what he wanted to know ? 
Neither Kate nor I was suffered to look at a study-book that day ; but I really thought the little learners found hard passages for the mere pleasure of having them explained . 
said Kate when one of the many intrusions had come to an end . 
`` O no , '' said Kate , -- `` you can not think what a comfort he has been to us . 
`` My dear Miss Kate ! 
`` You have not been to the Bird 's Nest , Mr. Rodney , '' said Kate presently . 
-- And silently our thoughts had gone there , and were viewing it as it appeared when we stood on some of the stepping-stone years that we had passed over ; when Andy out his head in at the door and said , `` If ye plase Miss Kate -- thin it was Caddie should ha ' tolt ye and would n't ! '' 
`` Misther Carvill Miss , -- he says would ye be afther lettin him have the dog now or will he take him , he says , Miss. '' `` Ask Mr. Carvill to walk in , '' said Kate . 
Kate and I sat looking at each other with some surprise and concern . 
`` In a long talk with Kate after you had gone to bed one night . '' 
`` Papa , '' said Kate looking up somewhat anxiously , `` you are not at liberty to break confidence -- I never gave you leave to repeat what I said . '' 
`` But papa -- you do not mean -- '' `` I will tell what I mean Kate , if you will allow me . 
`` Was that one of Miss Kate 's propositions ? '' 
Kate and I did raise the question , and we do truly love several people . '' 
`` Why papa -- take Kate for instance -- ought she to do anything to make herself happy if it made me miserable ? 
`` My dear Kate , '' said my father laughing and going round to her when we left the table , `` what are you so grave about ? 
`` An acquaintance of mine Miss Kate , '' said Mr. Rodney with a smile , as he followed us into the drawing-room , `` says that there is this great comfort in writing to a friend who knows her thoroughly , -- if perchance there is a word left out or put in , or another illegible , or her meaning be but half expressed , that friend has a clue to set it right . 
`` Mr. Rodney , '' said Kate , `` I wanted to tell you '' -- `` You did or did not want to tell me ? '' 
said he smiling , for Kate hesitated . 
`` O Miss Kate ! '' 
`` You 'll recover by to-morrow morning , '' said Kate laughing . 
Much you know about it , Miss Kate ! 
`` You are ever so little of a fast talker Master Candlish , '' said Kate , laying her hands upon the little face that was raised very benignly towards her . 
-- `` How much you look like your sister , '' said Kate . 
`` You have n't told me anything about this same sister of your since you came back , '' said Kate . 
Archie said : while Candlish opening his eyes in grave astonishment , exclaimed , `` Why Miss Kate ! 
This tribute to Kate 's simplicity was honoured with a very frank burst of merriment . 
he said , the hue of his cheeks nearly rivalling Kate 's , `` but I did n't ! 
She never talks about such things as other girls do , nor Miss Grace neither . '' 
Most unpleasantly startled I crept out of bed and going to my father 's door tapped gently -- he was already aroused ; and I went back with all quietness that I might not wake Kate . 
I had no mind that any encounter should come off without my powerful presence ; so dressing myself with all haste and stealthiness , I gave one glad look at Kate 's closed yes , listened a moment to make sure that Mrs. Howard was not up -- a fair proof she was not awake -- and then tipped my way down , -- the gladness of my heart thrown back , and the sorrow thrown forward . 
By this time mamma and Kate came down ; and we asked and told and consulted , till Caddie brought in breakfast and we had taken the brace of a cup of hot coffee . 
`` Very well , '' said Kate , `` let them come -- they wo n't get in . '' 
said Kate . 
`` Indeed an ' I do Miss Kate ! 
Well Miss Kate sure enough they giv this knock , and little Pat -LRB- that 's sister 's son to my brother-in-law Miss Kate -RRB- he just undid it ; and my father never knew a hate about it till they was all in , and he lighting the fire ; and the turf would n't burn ; and my father says ` Weary on it ! ' 
For ourselves we were afraid to venture out except all together , lest as Kate said , they should take advantage of our being out and beset the door . 
Kate spoke first , and softly . 
said Kate -- `` What should Mr. McLoon have to write to papa at this time of night ? 
`` But mamma , '' said Kate , `` what if they should come again ? 
`` Suppose we let Caddie come and sleep in our room , mamma , '' said Kate . 
So Caddie took up her mattress , and placing it in the middle of the room where we were all together that night , she presently went to sleep thereon . 
`` I do n't like to have you go into the garden alone , '' Kate would say . 
And if ever we cooled down a little , Caddie would strike in with , `` Why Miss Kate , I 've seen 'em keep watch day and night round a house , nor never lave it till they 'd get in ! '' 
said Kate . 
`` But then papa , '' said Kate gently , `` we must do as we can you know ; and consider what is best rather than what is pleasant . 
`` I do not intend to stay here in idleness Kate , -- the thing is how to leave you alone . '' 
`` Mamma , '' said Kate , after our minds had several times made the tour of circumstances ; `` would n't it be almost worth while for us to get board somewhere for the time papa wants to be gone ? '' 
`` Why that is a brave thought , Gracie , '' said Kate , -- `` I daresay she would , for their house has much more room in it than they can use . '' 
`` My dear Kate , '' said Mrs. Howard smiling , `` when you are at the head of a house always remember , that words spoken when they can do no good are worse than wasted . 
Kate looked as if she thought it a doubtful saving of expense . 
`` O yes , '' said Kate , `` we can manage the shirts well enough ; but that is such hard work for you mamma -- you had better let us take it . '' 
Quietly , steadily we worked ; Kate and I sometimes bending over the shirts , sometimes sitting up to look out at the blowing trees for recreation . 
Nevertheless Kate says I looked peaked , and I tell her that she looks pale ; and Mrs. Howard is only too ready for bed . 
Kate says she would about as lieve run the risk of breakage -- for `` when shall we ever give dinner-parties ? '' 
And Kate and I make a rush upstairs lest our sympathy should be testified in a very extraordinary manner . 
Kate seized a carpet-bag and ran down again , and I followed her with a bandbox . 
he said with an inquiring look towards Kate and me as we stood holding the door . 
`` You need n't be so skeery about the door Miss Kate -- if he gets in I 'd just as soon pitch him out as not , and a notion rather . 
said Kate . 
Our simple table and chairs looked very pleasant upon Mrs. Barrington 's bran new carpet , wherein were all the colours of the rainbow in most un-rainbow-like order ; and our books , Kate 's harp , and Wolfgang , made us feel at home . 
In some of the intervals of business Kate and I always gave the table a slight rearrangement , for it was impossible to get ` Dency out of her own style and into ours ; and she might have been born and bred a Southerner for the way she left the doors open -- she made a perfect avenue for herself from our room to the kitchen . 
her mother would call out from the pyroligneous quarter , `` come back and shut that door ! 
said Kate . 
`` But they told me you had left Glen Luna for the summer -- and of course -- I see you 've got your harp here too , Kate . '' 
`` Yes ma'am , '' said Kate gravely -- `` we always patronize dusting-brushes . '' 
`` I think it is ` Dency singing , '' said Kate with a smile . 
said Kate . 
`` Yesterday , '' said Kate . 
I need not explain it to you my dear Kate -- who are so systematic and make such admirable use of your time -- you understand it , do n't you ? '' 
said Kate with sparkling eyes . 
`` Yes , I thought so , '' said she giving Kate a most affectionate kiss . 
`` You must come and see her -- come all of you , it 'll be a nice walk , -- you might come every day as well as not . '' 
`` It is part of our discipline , '' said Kate as she turned away from the window . 
`` We wo n't eat a thing to-day but bread and butter and strawberries , '' said Kate laughing -- `` if you get ever so much , Mrs. Barrington . 
`` But the chickens , Miss Kate ! 
And Kate would look at me as with Miss Easy 's eyes , and tell me she wished I would wear a brighter face . 
`` This is Mrs. Egerton 's seal , I know , '' said Kate as she handed the note to my stepmother , `` What can she want of us ? '' 
said Kate . 
`` You see , '' said Mrs. Howard when she had entrusted the fatigued footman with her answer , `` you see my dear Kate it is never best to form a hasty judgment on any subject . '' 
`` We had some apparent reason in her case , mamma . 
Kate went of course ; with an additional touch of wonder at the new state of things ; and Mrs. Howard and I went pleasantly on with our work , speculating the while upon the benefits mind and body may gain by the aid of wheels and a good pair of horses . 
`` Let me see '' -- said Kate , -- `` if I only could tell it as it was told me ! 
Kate stopped to laugh , in spite of herself . 
Now mamma , '' she added , kneeling down by her , `` you shall not look grave about it ! '' 
said Kate . 
`` We have better friends left than Mrs. Egerton could be , dear Kate -- that is one comfort . 
`` They make the rest look all the darker , '' said Kate as she rose and turned away . 
`` Why , really ma'am , '' said Kate to another `` friend '' , who `` wished she could tempt us to visit her in town , '' -- `` I am very easily tempted . '' 
Their breath of hope and faith was not lost , it applied a strong brace to our weariness ; and Kate would often say , `` I can not imagine what people do that have no trust in the particular providence of God , -- who look to nothing beyond this world ! '' 
`` Why here are little green huckle-berries , '' said Kate . 
`` O Kate ! '' 
`` It 's only elder-blows Miss Kate . 
`` But they are harmless , '' said Kate . 
`` Not yet , '' said Kate smiling . 
`` You might look in at almost any window and say that , '' said Kate laughing . 
`` A family Miss Kate who know so much about hard times , that many other people seem ignorant in comparison , -- that 's why I want you to see them . 
Kate smiled with a full understanding of his words , and we were soon ready to set out . 
`` I do n't believe he 's very hungry , '' said Kate , -- `` he had his dinner before we came away . '' 
said Kate to a little tow mop in the corner , near which she had seated herself . 
`` O we do n't want anything to eat , '' said Kate , -- `` I should like a glass of water if you please Mrs. Flinter . '' 
`` A teacup would do perfectly , '' said Kate ; and out of two most unmated specimens of crockery we at last satisfied our thirst . 
`` It must be rather hard living up here indeed , '' said Kate 's gentle voice , which had all the sweetness of sympathy ; `` I wish we could do something to make it pleasanter . '' 
Nobody answered her -- nobody could , -- Kate 's head had sunk on her hands , and for a few moments we sat in absolute silence . 
You see Miss Kate , there is ` neither Greek nor Jew , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free , but Christ is all ! ' 
`` We will certainly , '' said Kate , `` and bring Wolfgang . '' 
`` Now Mr. Ellis , '' said Kate , speaking for almost the first time since we left Pillimaquady ; `` will you promise to apply to us if we can do any good ? 
`` Well I do n't know , '' said Mr. Ellis looking kindly at her and then at me . 
`` How does that happen , I wonder , '' said Kate . 
said Kate , in a sort of abstracted aside from the letter . 
`` We shall have to go back to our old economy in the sweet line , '' said Kate . 
`` It very seldom comes here , '' said Kate . 
`` I hope not sir , '' said Kate quietly . 
`` You know Mr. Carvill , '' said Kate , colouring a little but still speaking with the same quiet steadiness , `` the essence of an offence lies in the intention . 
said Kate smiling , `` though one of your items is a little indistinct , Mr. Carvill , -- but for your good decyphering we should have been puzzled . '' 
`` There 's plenty of room , '' said Mrs. Egerton -- `` we can sit close you know -- Cary and Amelia will take Kate between them , and -- O Michael take care of those horses ! 
And Mrs. Howard and Kate fairly put me in -- not because I was wanted but because I was tired . 
But I reached home in safety , and spent all my indignation in quieting that of mamma and Kate . 
During her residence at the Moon , she had found an old-country-man to whom for some hidden cause she took a fancy ; and they were to be married in November . 
said Kate . 
As it was , Kate and I went off in quick time . 
said Kate . 
`` And so would I , '' said Kate . 
Kate and I followed her to the door , but when we came back Mrs. Howard sat with her hands over her face , shedding some more sorrowful tears than she often indulged in . 
`` We shall be taken care of , '' Kate said though her own eyes were overflowing , -- ``` They that fear the Lord shall not want any good thing . ' '' 
My dear Kate ! 
`` There is n't much reality of it anywhere , '' said Kate . 
said Kate -- `` there 's only one ! '' 
`` I have been almost too angry to laugh , '' said Kate . 
said Kate , `` no indeed ! 
`` It was brought , '' said Kate , with a little indignant colour coming into her cheeks , `` by Mrs. Willet 's footman in full livery -- and he handed the basket in with as much daintiness as if it had been sugar-plums . 
My dear Kate ! '' 
ONE afternoon late in October , when it was already drawing towards dusk , Mr. Howard had gone into the woods to chop and mamma and Kate were disposing of the dinner dishes and talking to me as I sat on a bench by the fire . 
Not particularly pleased with their appearance I promised to call him , and then closed the door ; and going round to another entrance I set off for the woods , followed by Kate . 
`` Do not go in there Gracie , '' said Kate , `` it will only trouble you . 
The door closed behind them , and another one admitted Mrs. Howard and Kate . 
said Kate . 
`` But the house is left us yet , papa , '' said Kate -- `` and home lies not in tables and chairs . 
And she put her arm round me as if to ward off at least part of the burden . 
Then Kate and I went to get another of those careful teas -- not this time of welcome but of comfort . 
`` Papa , '' said Kate when we had been musingly gazing at our empty tea cups , `` had n't Grace and I better take out everything of our own to-night ? '' 
said Kate , looking down from the book-steps . 
`` Well '' -- said Kate , -- `` hand me up those books again Gracie . 
`` O never mind asking questions papa , '' said Kate . 
`` Those belong to mamma and me , '' said Kate . 
`` You had better let me go round too , papa , '' Kate whispered ; `` I do n't believe you know which the things are . '' 
So she and I followed with Mr. Howard the motions of the list-holder . 
`` We were cleaning house when that list was made , '' explained Kate , `` and the chairs stood all together in here . 
``` One Hebe ' -- there she stands . 
`` You understand Miss Howard , '' he added turning to Kate , `` whatever belongs to yourself or your sister I leave , of course . '' 
Kate and I brought it . 
-- `` Part of them are dead , and the rest are in the ground , '' said Kate -- `` There may be half a dozen . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Kate . 
Kate had left the room . 
`` Mr. Pratt , '' said Kate coming into the room , `` it would be a great convenience to us to keep our dictionaries at least till this business is finally settled . '' 
She stood listening to him with a little of her old look of superiority , and some very slight contempt for the pain that was so readily undertaken . 
said Kate . 
I brought the baskets , and Kate and I packed up the silver , wondering to ourselves if we should ever see it again , and thinking curiously of the times that were gone . 
`` Do you remember , '' said Kate as she stood holding in her hand Mr. Howard 's favourite Scalaria , `` do you remember Gracie when papa brought this home ? '' 
said Kate . 
`` It 's better that she do n't , '' said Kate -- `` she has enough to be sorry for I dare say , or will have . 
But these poor little harps -- '' and she pulled out the drawer . 
-- `` One look at you has almost reconciled me to parting with them , '' said Kate smiling . 
Meantime Kate and I sat quietly at our copying , having made the last necessary arrangements and persuaded Mrs. Howard to keep herself out of the way of all trouble and confusion . 
I had hardly ever seen it so pretty , and summoning Kate from her work we stood and looked at it together . 
We remembered that Hebe almost as long ago as thought went back -- my father had brought her from Italy when we were little children ; and into how many a conversation had she been wrought -- how many a gathering of loved faces had we seen near her . 
Yet there she stood with the same graceful attitude , the same sweet brightness of face , the same joyousness -- so like what we had been , so unlike what we were now ! 
Kate went away with full eyes . 
The four maple-chairs , -LRB- which were tea-room extras -RRB- stood there certainly -- the only chairs in the room ; but Kate and I immediately quitted the two we had in use , and informed Mr. Flagler that his list was correct . 
`` O no '' -- said Kate smiling ; `` they may as well go with the rest . 
The men had no words to answer ; and while the chairs were carried off in silence , I perched myself upon a four-legged stool , and Kate wheeled in one of the blue easy-chairs which belonged to us by virtue of inheritance , and so were out of Mr. McLoon 's power . 
said Kate . 
`` My dear Kate ! '' 
`` So does somebody else I know of , '' replied Kate as she untied the handkerchief that was over her head . 
`` I wish we could enact Miss Brown , I am sure , '' said Kate , `` so far as to have a good ride , -- there has a small portion of this dust settled upon my mind and spirits . 
said Kate kissing me . 
said Kate , `` how lovely you look ! 
`` Not quite presentable , '' she said with a smile ; `` and the sooner you are in order the sooner you can sit down and rest . '' 
`` It is a remarkable thing how tastes may change , '' said Kate , -- `` I used to have rather a despising of calico dresses , and now that clean one of mamma 's looked positively delightful ! '' 
said Kate . 
`` Why -- Miss -- Kate ! '' 
`` Yes sir , '' said Kate laughing , `` we have been all ready for some time , expecting you . '' 
`` My girls , '' he said , as he cleared the reins and gave himself two or three little preparatory wraps in his great coat ; `` my girls Miss Kate , my nieces that is , are so fashionable that they wo n't hear of a buffalo skin anywhere but in a sleigh , -- they 'd rather be cold . 
Everybody seemed to be abroad , -- the Squire was perpetually nodding or touching his hat , -- calling out to one man about grain , and to another about boards , and to another about his wife and children ; while Kate and I sat quietly smiling at the odd answers and sometimes questions that were returned to him . 
`` If I do n't mistake , '' said Squire Suydam , `` yonder comes one of your friends Miss Kate . '' 
-- `` Now Miss Kate , '' he said as we came upon high ground again , `` do n't you see a horseman away off on the turnpike ? 
said Kate laughing , as our increased rate of progress made us and the mud fly in almost equal proportion . 
-- `` Yes sir , '' said Kate as she sprang out ; `` we have enjoyed the ride too much not to want another . '' 
Kate and I glanced at each other in some uncertainty , -- how were we to tell what it would give our friend so much pain to hear ? 
`` We were very glad to get back '' -- said Kate hesitating a little , -- `` but -- you know ` the mind is its own place ' -- and things are not always just what they seem . '' 
`` No indeed , '' said Kate stopping short as we neared the threshold . 
`` No , stop , '' said Kate touching his arm with her hand , `` do n't go in yet -- I want to talk to you . 
`` But the difficulty is , '' I said , `` they can never be got in again -- those that Kate means . '' 
`` And what does she mean ? '' 
Come Miss Kate , '' he added , taking hold of the hand which had hitherto detained him , `` what is the matter ? 
`` I am thinking , '' said Kate , half laughing because she would not cry , and with her eyes apparently fixed upon the lake ; `` I am thinking of a man who forgot that he was wounded until he had to tell his friend of it . '' 
-- `` Mr. Rodney , '' she said , `` do you remember Mr. Freeman 's definition of a family in moving time ? 
he said looking earnestly at her . 
And turning hastily round , Kate opened the door and we entered . 
`` Only a little profitable amusement , '' said Kate looking laughingly up at him . 
`` No I am not -- '' said Kate with some effort after voice and smile together , -- `` it is only a reflection -- induced by these papers . 
-- `` Maybe it was Kate 's . '' 
`` Now , '' said Kate , `` if you will just sit down in that great chair and look at the fire , you will forget all that is or is not behind you . '' 
`` Put yourself in it Miss Kate , and you Gracie in that other ; and I will sit here and look at what I like . 
`` Happy and peaceful we have been in spite of it , '' said Kate ; -- `` a little wearied , a little tried -- enough to make us appreciate friendly faces ; but the confusion of the house did not reach far into our minds , and we have been much less cast down than I could have believed beforehand . 
His eye glanced round the room , and Kate and I could not help smiling . 
`` You wo n't find the ameliorating circumstances if you look for them , '' said Kate , -- `` they address themselves chiefly to the ear . 
`` We have proved that , '' Kate said with full eyes . 
`` If you would only take my advice and look at the fire , '' said Kate , `` it would cheer you up amazingly -- the walls of this room are not enlivening . '' 
`` Papa , '' said Kate softly and laying her hand on his forehead , `` have you any idea where your eyebrows are ? '' 
KATE and I had a busy early morning of it . 
`` If one could only get here without coming through that empty drawing-room -- '' Kate said . 
We gave him our lips by way of good-morning and answer ; but while I seated myself at the corner of the fire my father held Kate fast , and repeated his question . 
`` I have been -- among the flours -- just now , '' said Kate looking down and smothering a laugh . 
And covering her face with her hands , the laugh burst forth in good earnest . 
My father drew her to him for another kiss , but looked as if he had found less than a little . 
`` O they are safe -- '' said Kate smiling , though the bright tears were ready to fall . 
said Kate , `` you have certainly taken up -- whose rule was it -- for obtaining information , this morning ! 
Mr. Howard passed his hand once or twice very fondly over her head , pushing the hair off her forehead and looking at her in a way that made reply hardly necessary . 
Kate laughed , and the snow-drop was very quickly supplanted . 
`` Why really , '' she said , `` I did not think of that before -- Gracie does look something like one , down there in the corner . 
`` Nobody answers my questions , '' said Kate , `` and I am expected to answer everybody ! '' 
Kate preferred another mode of tactics , -- choosing rather to abolish the shadows than to find her way through them She stood still for a moment after Mr. Howard had gone , and then looking up at the referee with a gravity which somewhat impaired his own , she said , `` Did you ever study botany , Mr. Collingwood ? '' 
But she could not raise her eyes again for a minute after his glance . 
Mr. Rodney said , gently installing her in one of the easy-chairs , and taking his stand at the back of it . 
`` Perhaps you know then , '' said Kate , her lips trembling a little but steadying themselves by degrees , `` that it is a particular little flower , and needs particular soil and care . 
said Kate when some ten minutes had passed . 
said Kate springing from her chair . 
or was Miss Kate talking entirely from imagination ? '' 
`` If anybody is curious on the subject of Muffinaria , '' said Kate opening the door , `` they are at present ready for inspection . '' 
She made a very bright connecting link between the room we left and the room we were going to , and I half hoped that Mr. Collingwood might notice nothing else on the way ; but though I could not see that he looked about him , I yet felt sure that his eye sought one or two familiar places to find whether they were filled or empty . 
Kate and I both read it in his face when we first sat down to breakfast ; but either other influences wore that off , or Mr. Collingwood thought there was enough thoughtfulness afloat without his , for there was no appearance of it afterwards . 
-- `` No occasion to be frightened Miss Kate -- if I run over anybody it wo n't be you -- I believe there is a contingent barrier somewhere . 
`` Do you think now Miss Kate that anybody -- that is to say Mrs. Howard of course -- would object to Mr. Collingwood 's dining at the Lea to-day ? 
`` If you had only taken the trouble to go in and see mamma , sir , '' said Kate , `` she could have saved so severe a trial of his patience , and satisfied you at once . '' 
`` I am extremely sorry Miss Kate to have frightened you into anything like paleness -- I shall not soon forget it , -- but so far as I am concerned this interview has been perfectly satisfactory and well worth waiting for . 
`` This is but a tiny visit , '' said Kate . 
Wolfgang wagged his tail , and looked at Kate . 
`` He will do anything she tells him to , and will mind none of the rest of us if Kate is by . '' 
`` I think he will be almost as sorry to part with Kate as she will be to part with him , Mr. Rodney . '' 
said Kate . 
Kate smiled . 
`` We will give them to you nicely done up and sealed , that none of them may get lost , '' said Kate . 
`` Now Mr. Rodney , '' she said , answering his look with a most fair one , `` please do not ask any questions , -- see how long the shadows are -- it is quite time for you to go . 
-- I asked Kate but she did n't seem to understand it any better than I did . 
So you perceive that if I had plenty of money and half a dozen silly children , I should be a poorer man than I am now with only you and Kate . '' 
they would be poorer children too -- unless one of them was Kate . '' 
said Kate . 
`` Every true woman Kate , carries about with her a sort of india-rubber framework that fits itself to any niche where she may be placed ; but at the same time one niche is better adapted to her than another . 
As one woman needs the drapery of wealth and circumstance ; while another takes all the adorning upon herself , and makes you forget to look at her niche . '' 
But Kate would not hear of it , and even Mrs. Howard and I could not say that it would be wise , or that we could not better live without music than without tables and chairs and carpets . 
Then at some word from us he would come up to be patted , and for five minutes walk very gravely by Kate ; until the discipline of circumstances became too irksome , and he dashed off by himself seeing that no one would go with him . 
Kate had gone upstairs and the rest of us were in the sitting-room , when Mr. Barrington , finding no one in the kitchen to answer his summons , came round and tried the front door . 
`` Here 's some sort of a concern for you , Squire , '' he said -- `` leastways for Miss Kate . 
`` Something for Kate ? '' 
My father stayed not to ask further questions but followed Ezra to his cart , whence they presently brought in the only thing that short description suited , and the only thing I thought it could not be -- Kate 's harp . 
In all this time Kate had not come down ; and I did not call her yet , that she might have the full surprise of seeing her harp in perfect order and in open view when she entered the room . 
We took off all its wrappings , placed it just to our satisfaction , and then stood to watch the door as Kate came singing down stairs . 
The knob was turned and she came in . 
Her eye saw the harp at once , and she stopped short with such a bright flush of pleasure as did us all good to see . 
But the next look was rather sorrowful , and she came forward saying , `` My dear papa ! 
she continued , but giving her old favourite many kind looks and touches the while . 
she repeated gently -- `` it was not quite right : there were so many other things wanted ! '' 
said Kate raising her head and looking at us all by turns . 
If it ever faded amid the keen pleasure of hearing Kate play , of seeing her pleasure , of sitting in the twilight as we had so often done , to hear the old favourite songs with which we had such loved associations ; it revived in double force afterwards ; and the very strong love and thankfulness that I had for somebody , went on increasing at the rate of compound interest because the principal could not be paid . 
Kate seldom mentioned the subject ; but , as I remarked , she spent all her thanks for the harp in her frequent and happy use of it . 
When she was tired , when she had a spare five minutes , above all if she felt sad , this was the favourite rest and amusement ; and none of us had realized the comfort we had lost till it came back again . 
Partly because the sitting-room was thus taken up , partly because the coming of strangers had made us a little nervous , Kate and I went out to walk ; and , as we often did when our spirits wanted composing , we took our way to one of the many little brown huts that spotted the beautiful country in summer . 
said Kate looking into the cradle . 
`` Mamma made you some more broth , '' said Kate producing a pitcher from under her cloak , -- `` you said your husband relished it . '' 
`` You are not well , '' said Kate , -- `` and this poor little thing does not like to be left alone when it 's sick . 
Mrs. O'Keefe protested , but Kate was determined , and throwing her wrappers into my arms -LRB- there was no other clean place -- we had not even ventured to sit down -RRB- she began mixing and working in good earnest . 
said Kate as she stood by the stove to dry her hands in preference to using a towel . 
`` Well do n't make any more '' -- said Kate with a slight shudder at the thought of any sick person 's taking such a compound , -- `` I 'll send you some . 
`` No it is n't a bit '' -- said we bestowing them as Kate had proposed . 
was her earnest reply , given with true Irish adaptation . 
I many a time dreaded my father 's visits , -- Mamma and Kate were so constantly about me , that we were in a measure used to each other . 
As for ` Dency -- the satisfaction with which she entered my room was great , and would lead one to suppose that she would be rather sorry than otherwise when I got well . 
`` We shall have you down stairs again to-morrow , dear Gracie , '' Kate said to me one morning . 
`` You wo n't think so when you are able to move about yourself , '' she said kissing me . 
Again her lips touched my forehead from which she was brushing back the hair . 
`` I could n't bring my harp upstairs very well , '' said Kate smiling . 
said Kate . 
said the little handmaid after she had set down her load and stationed herself to survey my general appearance . 
said Kate . 
But Kate I want you to tell me everything that was said this morning while you were down stairs . '' 
`` Not much , '' said Kate smiling . 
Once in a while Kate was persuaded to take a ramble but generally she would not leave me , unless I was in one of those deep slumbers with which I tried to make up for lost time and rest . 
Nor always then ; and glad as I was to have her go , my eyes always sought her the moment they were open ; and perhaps it was well that she could only see the expression they wore when successful in their search . 
`` Gracie , '' he said to me one day , when I had exchanged a waking-up smile with both himself and Kate , `` you remind me of those flowers that contrive to look at the sun all the time -- no matter where he is . 
`` And you think Kate is the centre of attraction ? '' 
said Kate 's voice and hand at once . 
-- `` That question may as well be settled as the other has been , '' said Kate -- `` I think I will have nothing to say about it . '' 
Did Kate tell you ? '' 
`` She said something to me about it . '' 
Kate said yesterday that if papa could have got her a new one she should n't have loved it half so well . '' 
But I am very glad Miss Kate is of that mind -- since she has this and not another . '' 
I was in my usual place on the sofa next morning , when Kate came down dressed in her habit . 
she said . 
Kate , you look lovely ! '' 
she said with a laugh . 
I thought anybody might have been proud to ride with her ! 
`` The sunlight has dazzled your eyes , '' said Kate . 
Gracie , I hope you have a picture of Miss Kate to look at while she is away ? '' 
Miss Kate has been looking at you , and the consequence is that she has but one glove on . '' 
I looked round at Kate , and I suppose my face again told my thoughts , for they both laughed , and Kate after one farewell kiss declared herself ready . 
I would not have it supposed that Kate was all this time in mounting her horse . 
The horse destined for Kate had been held by a groom until she came out , but the other one stood quietly by himself a few steps off , with the bridle thrown over his head as if he could be trusted . 
A long period of what the Spaniard called `` walking on the earth '' had lost Kate none of her old skill as a horsewoman , -- her hand was as steady , her spring as light and fearless as ever , -- I thought I had never seen her do the business so well ; but that might be because she had such very perfect assistance . 
Her part was perfect too , -- and I thought I was not the only one who appreciated it ; for a few words which I did not hear had called forth a somewhat heightened colour , and a not at all displeased little laugh . 
I had often seen her on horseback , but never with so much pleasure -- never before with anything like pain , -- yet there it was now at my heart ; -- I could not mistake it . 
The particular pleasure was easily fathomed , -- she had not ridden for a great while -- it would do her much good -- and as much pleasure , -- I knew that from her face . 
I was not sorry to have her go and leave me -- tears started at the very idea of such selfishness . 
I was not afraid , -- Mr. Rodney 's every look and touch told what care he would take of her and his qualifications for the office . 
If I had not been sure she would enjoy herself I would not have urged her going . 
There seemed some mystified notion in my mind which I could neither seize nor lose sight of , -- some singular feeling of grief that she could be so very happy independently of me . 
But papa -- has Kate got home ? '' 
`` I have seen nothing of her my dear , since I got home myself . '' 
`` O do you think she will get wet ? '' 
`` I am afraid she will Gracie -- if this rain falls upon her . '' 
Sleep had restored my mind to its usual quietness , and I was all anxious to see Kate come back , and to be sure that the rain had done her no harm . 
At the first sound I raised myself up , just in time to see Kate ride up to the door , and at the same moment Mr. Carvill moved forward as if he meant to go to help her off -- then stepped back again with a look I could not comprehend . 
She would have been off without help had not her companion been too quick for her ; and after that light spring down , she came in , holding up her habit , and looking as I had said before , lovely . 
Her first smile was a perfect cure of the soreness that yet remained from those strange thoughts . 
she said , `` you are -- Mr. Carvill ! '' 
-- and she stopped short with a colour that was by no means hesitating . 
`` You should not have seen me this some time , Miss Kate , '' -- said that gentleman . 
Then here is my brother -- '' Kate came and knelt down by me . 
`` I hope you enjoyed your ride , Miss Kate , '' said Mr. Carvill . 
-- Will you ask why , if I inquire whether you got wet , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` I believe I should , '' she said smiling , -- `` because you must see that I did not . '' 
But as Miss Kate very justly remarks -- one must see what one must -- '' `` And never what one must not , '' -- said Mr. Rodney . 
-- Miss Kate -- I salute your shadow , -- Mr. Collingwood -- will your visionship appear in full proportions at my dinner-table ? '' 
Miss Kate -- the bright eyes of shadows are proverbial , -- will you give me ocular demonstration of yours ? 
said Kate . 
Did you leave her there ? '' 
`` O have been , '' I said , feeling soothed -- `` and my sleep rested me , -- and I was so glad to see Kate again . '' 
`` If you had been well , and at the other side of me , '' he went on , `` Miss Kate would have enjoyed the ride exceedingly -- so she said . '' 
`` O she did as it was ! '' 
I said earnestly -- `` I know she did ! 
She was looking so well when she came in . '' 
`` And so she did all the time she was out , '' said Mr. Collingwood . 
Sometimes with Mrs. Howard sometimes with Kate , I used to walk myself tired , come in and rest , and go out again . 
I had come in from my morning walk one day , and Kate had left the room ; and bonnet in hand I stood half deliberating whether I would not go once more down the walk -- it looked so pleasant . 
-- And she answered , `` Mr. Collingwood and Kate . '' 
There I sat me down and tried to think , -- but it was like the rush of the whirlpool ; from which every now and then came up myself as a half wreck , with this one colour nailed to the mast -- `` Kate going to leave me ! '' 
`` No -- for you do not know what Kate is yet . '' 
`` I think I know a little about it ; but dear Gracie I am not going to take Kate far away from you . '' 
`` No sir -- but -- you have never lived in the house with her , -- you do not know what it would be to have her even half a mile off . '' 
There was no one in the sitting-room , but as I ran up stairs Kate met me . 
she said with an anxious look , and laying her hand upon my shoulder . 
`` Yes , '' I said , giving her one kiss ; and then quickly escaping I ran up to my room -- but it was to throw myself on the bed in a new burst of tears , -- again so sorrowful , so bewildered . 
Nothing could have stayed them , but my promise and the fear of Kate 's coming for me . 
But I must compose myself and go down , and I did ; and seating myself on a low seat by her 's , I laid my head on Kate 's lap without a word , and with her hand drawn round my neck . 
For a while they talked on , -- of Miss Easy and all her love and loveliness , of the years before and the years since we came to Glen Luna ; but now and then the slight tremor in Kate 's voice , or the clasp of the fingers I held , told where her thoughts were -- and it almost broke my heart to have her grieved for me . 
I did not venture to do that ; but Mr. Rodney had touched the most powerful spring of self-control , and I did raise my head and leaned it against Kate . 
And then -- it might have been because I thought myself so strong in my resolution -- something in the touch of her arms as she put them round me , threw down all my defences ; and I burst into such tears as I never meant she should see . 
-- '' `` Please do not think that you love Kate a bit too much ? '' 
`` I am in no danger of it , though you give me the credit of knowing so little about her . 
And as to her love for you -- I 'm afraid I must submit to that as a necessary part of human nature . 
I had no desire to ask many questions , nor in truth much need , -- it seemed as if my mind had answered them all to itself ; and I lay silent and quiet in Kate 's arms for a long time , going over the last two years wonderingly . 
she said at length . 
My arm which was round her waist answered for me that I was awake . 
And wrapping her in an embrace so close that it half belied my words , and with her head bent down and resting upon mine , sleep came to me without asking . 
Seldom as I was left alone to my musings , I was never indulged in them unless alone ; and often with my hand and Kate 's held together in his , Mr. Rodney made me talk whether I would or not . 
Never had Kate seemed to love me so much , -- never had I so clung to her . 
But I was right -- I could not be miserable if she was happy . 
I sprang away to give the message , choking down my thoughts that Kate might not see them , and with the full intention of not coming back ; but she would take no denial , and I could only get ready and follow her down stairs . 
But the appearance of Kate was considered invitation enough , -- the dog rushed in , and after making of himself a frisking barrier for some moments , sat gravely down and presented his paw to Kate before she could even shake hands with his master . 
To see Kate anything but happy had been almost the greatest trial I had ever thought of ; and now to have her happiness so well secured -- even to my jealous fears -- was very pure delight . 
It was easy to read Mrs. Barstow 's wish , -- the expression of her face was sometimes a little too much for Kate 's equanimity ; and her eyes went from one to the other with a look that said her own trials were all out of sight . 
There could hardly have been a better cure for them than the conversation she had with Mr. Rodney , or than his prayer before we came away . 
`` He often comes , '' she said when Kate and I were bidding her goodbye , and our companion was speaking to Mrs. Flinter . 
`` That is a singularly happy person , '' Kate said when we had sat musing for a while . 
-- `` Is it strange dear Kate , that now and then one should reach a point which all may attain ? '' 
The starting tears were her only answer . 
`` It will do for me to talk about it , '' he said presently , -- `` I , who have nothing left to wish for in this world , -- I fear I should have been a poor example of my own precepts . 
said Kate . 
`` Gracie dear , '' said Kate after a pause , `` what are you looking so grave about ? '' 
`` Thinking -- '' I said , starting out of my reverie which had fastened upon her last words . 
said Kate , who having missed the clue , had taken it all in straightforward simplicity . 
But Mr. Rodney only smiled , and telling her that it would be hard to account for it except by the association of ideas , we got up and pursued our walk , -- warned by one or two little pats on the forehead that April showers might come down in May . 
said Kate . 
`` But we never saw you in a hay-field , '' said I -- for Kate did not seem disposed to speak . 
`` Yes , very , '' said Kate laughing -- `` I do n't believe you ever were there , for my part . 
she said with a half laughing half doubtful shake of the head . 
The smile which answered her might have been translated , `` And as it is , for ` anything ' read everything . '' 
She looked up in surprise , but then finding the clue she had wanted before , her resemblance to the very delicatelytinted `` Odorata '' decidedly decreased ; and as her eyes went back to the view before us , Kate gravely remarked that it `` was raining very fast at Wiamee . '' 
`` Do n't you remember , Kate ? 
she said , adroitly slipping off Kate 's shoe and displaying the sole of it . 
`` But our feet are quite warm , '' said Kate , `` and the shoes dry enough . '' 
And carefully setting up our shoes in the fireplace , Kate and I had no resource but to put our feet in the same region ; for the currents of air were rather cool with stockings for a medium . 
`` But he is only going to Ethan , '' said Kate , -- `` we hope to see him very often . '' 
`` I do n't believe that will ever happen to Mr. Ellis and Mr. Collingwood , '' said Kate smiling , -- `` they like each other too well . '' 
`` So I have been told , '' said Kate . 
Mr. Collingwood laughed , and telling her that it had given him a great deal of pleasure to find out how well Mr. Ellis was appreciated , he opened the door ; but Mrs. Houghton pulled Kate and me back to the fire . 
Are you thinking still of that remark of Kate 's ? '' 
The day of our involuntary visit to Mrs. Houghton , when Kate and I came down after a somewhat long and talkative dinner-toilet we found Mrs. Willet in the drawing-room . 
`` How long have you been home , Kate ? '' 
`` That 's a beautiful silk of yours , Kate -- a new one I suppose . 
`` In the neighbourhood of Wiamee , '' said Kate , by no means choosing to give an exact answer . 
`` My dearest Kate ! 
`` No ma'am , '' said Kate again , with a little flush of vexation at this string of cross-questions . 
Never make a mystery of anything -- and in this case there was no need , -- if you had lived a little more in the world Kate , you would know that nothing is more common than for a gentleman to join any of his lady-friends he may meet ; -- and I do n't know that his being your pastor need make any difference . '' 
`` Not before our own house was in sight , '' said Kate , with a look that promised small information . 
Kate said when he came in from handing the lady to her carriage . 
`` The first thing you know , papa , '' said Kate laughing , `` you will have to give me one of your old lectures on pride . '' 
`` No I shall not , '' he answered gravely and looking down at her upturned face ; `` because you know my dear , pride is always considered very unbecoming in a clergyman 's wife -- so I am sure you would have too much good sense to indulge in it . 
I thought -- it half seemed to me as if Mr. Howard thought too -- of that Newyear 's morning years ago when he had stood just there and called Kate his rosebud , -- the eyes that rested on her wore so much the same expression -- and her 's cast down , as they were then . 
But it was with a graver face now that my father kissed her and walked away . 
said Kate laughing . 
`` As many as feel disposed -- but not without my consent asked and obtained , Miss Kate . '' 
Mr. Collingwood came and bent down by Kate . 
said Kate when she could compose her face . 
`` If you have any scruples concerning Wednesday , Mr. Rodney , I being quite disinterested , can perhaps resolve them better than Kate . '' 
said Kate . 
`` You are altogether too botanical '' -- said Kate . 
said Kate -- `` teazle , I think . 
Miss Kate , I am particularly sorry to have given youany cause to dislike me . '' 
Kate could very well have dispensed with the repetition . 
`` I must confess -- I have had a presentiment for a long time Miss Kate -- if not from the first day I had the honour of seeing you -- that we should by some means or other become at least better acquaintances , -- not to say friends -- or any thing else . '' 
said Kate , with some effort after her usual composure . 
-- it will give me a little chance to talk to you ; and allow me to say , Miss Kate , I wish it might give you a little desire to talk to me -- as the nearest representative of the said Admiral , -- or is he better known to you by the synonyme of Lord Rodney ? '' 
said Kate , who felt a little doubtful concerning the best means of self-defence , -- `` the weather ? 
Have you a good supply , Miss Kate , or may I have the pleasure of furnishing you with some new ones ? '' 
`` Thank you , Mr. Carvill , '' said Kate , in whose face there were indeed `` beautiful contrasts '' she could by no means keep down , `` but I think we have varieties enough -- at least as many as we can take care of . 
Ah Miss Kate ! 
The effect was seen by one person at least , and roused her to an unwonted piece of boldness in the way of diversion . 
`` That is rather a free translation , '' said Kate . 
said the gentleman displaying an immense lump of sugar for her approval . 
Did you ever learn , Mr. Carvill , '' said Kate , `` the name of the next principle that is usually developed after the saccharine ? '' 
said Kate from behind her coffeecup , if `` I hadthe power of transformation you never saw a veritable mouse 's ear run away as I would do ! 
`` Miss Kate , '' said Mr. Ellis coming up to us , `` I never saw you looking so well ! '' 
`` You have seen me feeling a great deal better , sir , '' said Kate half laughing . 
`` I never look at him , Miss Kate , '' said Mr. Ellis , `` without thinking of the old sailor 's remark about a ship 's sails -- ` how quietly they do their work ! ' '' 
`` That could not be said of everybody in there , '' said Kate , as she looked through quite an atmosphere of gestures and exclamations . 
Miss Kate , may I ask you a very rude question ? 
`` Yes , '' she said with a smile . 
said Kate gravely . 
Miss Kate , you shall excuse me if I enter into no unnecessary explanations as to whichmember of the family was in my mind . 
Then rising , Mr. Rodney gave the lady his arm , and bringing her across the room fairly placed her by Kate , with the simple remark , `` Mrs. Carvill wishes to renew her acquaintance with you , Miss Kate . '' 
`` Yes , I care for it very much , '' said Kate smiling . 
she said most expressively , -- `` there is very little that I should call that in this country -- there can not be . '' 
said Kate . 
she said with an expression of disgust . 
`` I do appreciate those faults , though , '' said Kate -- ``` some do not know and some do not talk , '' -- they are not always faults , either -- they are oftener mistakes . '' 
`` Miss Kate will you enlighten my ignorance ? '' 
Mr. Rodney , '' she said , her eye almost unconsciously seeking one where she felt sure of sympathy , `` you remember what Addison says -- ` as few of his thoughts are drawn from business , they are most of them fit for conversation ' ? '' 
`` And which has been my mistake this evening , Miss Kate ? '' 
said Mr. Rodney interposing , for Kate 's face gave rather a quick answer . 
`` If you talked about guns and dogs , I do n't wonder Miss Kate had nothing to say to you . '' 
said Mr. Carvill -- `` never shall make a distant allusion to thatsubject again -- do n't think she likes it . 
I would n't even dare to ask her to look at Canis major . '' 
`` And yet now I think of it -- since it has been touched upon -- Miss Kate -- I believe you have the dog-rose in your collection ? '' 
She had been watching every word and look of Kate 's as if she wanted to make up her own mind about her ; now giving most grave attention , now smiling a little that anybody could be confused about anything . 
Perhaps she thought this last point wanted a remedy , or else the kindliness which I had seen growing in her eyes wished to show itself ; for touching Kate 's cheek as if she had been a child , Mrs. Carvill said with a half smile , `` Est-ce que vous mettez votre rouge toujours ainsi ? '' 
`` Elle sera amie à toute épreuve , '' continued the lady , looking up at Mr. Rodney as if it never entered her head that Kate could dislike the subject , -- `` si belle ! 
`` But Mrs. Carvill , '' said Kate , trying to rouse herself and clinging to English as if she thought French ground dangerous , `` do n't you think it is right sometimes to bestow things where they are not quite deserved ? '' 
I believe for once Kate was not sorry to see Mr. Carvill come back . 
`` I think Mr. Ellis will provide him with one , ma'am , '' said Mr. Carvill with a glance at Kate , who though she was talking to some one else gave most unwilling notice that she heard him . 
said Mr. Howard looking towards Kate and Mrs. Carvill . 
Now sit down there like a nice man and keep yourself quiet -- I 'm going to make Kate sing . '' 
`` Kate my dear , you must come and sing for us . '' 
`` Never mind , my dear -- suppose you persuade Miss Kate to sing ` Où peut on être mieux qu'au sein de son famille ' -- it 's a remarkably fine air ! '' 
And Kate by a rather quick and skilful movement escaped Mr. Carvill 's vigilance , and escorting herself to the piano sang whatever was called for , -- even , at last , Mr. Carvill 's song ; for everybody took it up so warmly that she could not get off . 
And Mr. Rodney and I stood close behind her to listen . 
`` Miss Kate , '' he said , offering her his arm as she hastily left the music-bench , `` Mrs. Howard commissioned me to tell you that you would find her in the dressing-room . '' 
And leading her up to Mrs. Willet while my father and I followed , we made our adieus , and emerged first into the hall and then into the cool starlight , -- how refreshing to both mind and body ! 
THE days flew like a flock of robins in the sunshine -- every one showing some bright touch of gold or crimson ; and though it was `` summer weather , '' even I could not be sad : Kate blew away every cloud as fast as it rose , and Mr. Rodney half deluded me into the belief that they were but the remnants , not the beginnings of bad weather . 
if ever people were happy self-denyingly , we were ; and Kate looked at me sometimes with eyes that were all tearful in their gratitude . 
Not quite , -- for even with the feeling my hand sought Kate 's and they were fast clasped together . 
`` I shall add another ` and then ' , '' said Kate . 
`` I was thinking most of that -- thinking , my dear Kate , with unspeakable pleasure ! 
There was no more said then , for some time , except as the clasp of Kate 's hand told me that the word `` both '' had for her a double bearing . 
Then she said in those very quiet , low tones where several feelings as it were moderate each other , `` How strongly in a few simple words , the Bible draws a portrait , while men with their numberless tints and touches sometimes almost cover up what they attempt to make plain . '' 
`` But not to you , my dear Daphne , '' he added , and laying a very gentle hand upon her brow -- `` I should not think your spirits needed schooling . 
But she gave him no answer except a slight shake of the head , with a very little bit of a smile to bear it company . 
Kate said softly , and laying her head on his shoulder . 
`` Of pleasure , my dear child , '' he said passing his arm round her . 
And not even the weakest among us , '' he added , resting his lips on her forehead , `` would evade the one to-morrow -- for the sake of those which shall follow it . '' 
Kate said , looking up despairingly . 
But that trying and yet blessed relief , necessity -- the call for immediate action -- came to my help ; and with one kiss and word I roused Kate from the dream which had half given her a shadow of my waking thoughts . 
Her eye met mine -- and as instantly her arms were about me and my face drawn down to hers , -- then quickly disengaging myself , I went to the window and looked out into the early twilight . 
I stood a minute -- long enough for the mind to draw one of those quick , heart-felt comparisons that an hour 's study could hardly retouch , and then turned to find Kate close by me . 
`` Gracie , '' she said , with lips that would scarce be controlled , `` if you are going to look so pale to-day , I shall not quite know what to do . 
I should have been long getting them had there been time , -- as it was , I thought gladly that Kate could not tell dewdrops from tears . 
With what pleasure I dressed her hair ! 
One other sprig , that I thought hidden among its more showy neighbours , Kate saw with tears that were hard to check , -- the little blue forget-me-not . 
she said , taking me in her arms , `` never -- till I forget myself ! '' 
And I could answer her almost calmly , braced now , with excitement . 
I could even watch -- it was not very steadily -- the looks that met her when she came down stairs ; and I laughed with the rest , though no thanks to myself , at the wondering exclamation of little ` Dency Barrington , `` Do n't it beat all , Mrs. Howard ! '' 
Not now , -- I was as calm outwardly as Kate herself . 
And as the sun rising higher and higher drove away the last shadow , and poured a full stream of light through the open church-door , even Mr. Rodney and Kate seemed a vision , in that bright halo . 
But Kate heard their carriage approach , with a look that was only half resigned and the other half fearful . 
`` Perhaps my sense will come back to me , '' Kate said , trying to reassure herself with a laugh , -- `` at all events do n't think any more about it . '' 
`` Miss Kate , it gives me extreme satisfaction to find that the torch which has been so recently waved over your head has not in the least impaired the freshness and profusion of your roses . 
`` And I think , '' said Mr. Rodney , `` that ` Miss Kate ' as you call her would like your conversation quite as well if it were a little less flowery . '' 
`` My dear sir , '' said Mr. Carvill , `` if you are not classical , that can not be helped , -- I perceive Miss Kate understands me perfectly . 
If she were in England , of course -- I might say Lady Rodney at once , -- but here -- '' `` Je ne sais quelle finesse vous entendez à celà , '' said Mrs. Carvill , glancing from one to the other in uncertainty . 
`` Tant soit peu , '' Kate said with a smile , and raising her eyes `` to order , '' though the lady 's look of examination and interest was rather hard to bear . 
Kate might have been thankful for the quick look which protected her from Mr. Carvill 's commentary on his wife 's remark . 
`` Miss Kate , '' he said in a disconsolate tone , `` I am forbidden to talk to you ! '' 
`` Not by me , sir , '' she said so gently and steadily that Mr. Carvill for the second time in his life looked a little like the rest of his family . 
But waving all rights of precedence , Mr. Rodney had given Kate the next place -- much to her satisfaction . 
And then as we reached the breakfast-room Mr. Rodney quietly frustrated his brother 's intentions , and placed me in the third seat , by himself and Kate . 
`` I am sure that Miss Kate is saying mentally , ` ni de près ni de loin ! ' '' 
`` I think the will has a good deal to do with it , Mrs. Carvill , '' said Kate , -- `` on garde ce qu'on aime et passe par les autres . '' 
Are you fond of that cordial , Miss Kate ? '' 
`` I declare , '' he said then , `` I will not speak another word to you to-day Miss Kate , if you will only settle that difficult question -- que faut-il que je vous appelle ? '' 
`` Votre sujet , ce matin , '' said Kate smiling . 
Miss Kate -- if you will permit me to pay my respects at some future day , I hope I shall have recovered the power of speech . '' 
I was proud and surprised and amused to see the way his wife looked at Kate . 
Of a singularly untrusting disposition -- perhaps because she had been brought up among poor specimens of human nature -- she seemed to have been half fascinated with the very true and trustful eyes which were my delight , -- nor mine only . 
With all Mrs. Carvill 's respect and liking for Mr. Rodney there was perhaps mingled a little reserve ; but there was nothing about Kate to call for it , and Mrs. Carvill treated her as if she were the prettiest little natural curiosity she had ever seen , -- and the most loveable . 
`` Toujours '' -- Kate said , with no lack of cordiality in look or voice , but colouring at the same time so much , that Mrs. Carvill fairly laughed at her . 
And laying her hands on Kate 's shoulders and looking at her for half a minute , Mrs. Carvill dismissed her with a summary little kiss and `` mille amitiés . '' 
Kate said as they left the room , `` I have not had a chance to say three words to you . 
said Kate . 
`` That was rather a dubious look that passed from Kate to me . 
`` I should like to see you at one of those times , '' said he smiling , -- `` I shall be a very uncompromising guardian , now that I have taken upon myself a part of Kate 's care for you . 
`` I was thinking of the unreasonable wish you had just expressed , '' said Kate raising her eyes from a very grave contemplation of her bouquet -- `` at least if all wishes be unreasonable which can not be fulfilled . 
Yes -- they have not changed a bit , -- except that there is no dew on them , '' I said looking hastily from her eyes to the flowers . 
And after dinner we were to accompany Kate to her new home . 
But once only my fortitude gave way , -- it was when Kate paused for a moment as I had seen her do so many years before , to take one look at the home she was leaving . 
`` The path will take its old look again , very soon , Gracie , -- ` the grass will not grow under your feet ' when you are coming to see Kate . '' 
`` I wonder , '' I said , `` what ever made him take such a special fancy to Kate ? '' 
I was very calm again ; and keeping close by Kate 's side could look at all within doors and without that was so hung with associations , and talk of the many pleasant things we remembered in that place . 
-- nay in those bright days beyond the line , there was no place for the something which at last began to assert its power , as I sat by Kate looking up and listening -- happy in spite of that weight . 
-- With the weight a little lightened now , by the gentle directing of my thoughts and by Kate 's loving kiss , which said the jewel was still the same ; and not least , by seeing how precious it was in other eyes than mine ; I again sat quietly listening , -- learning as Mr. Ellis had said , to cling to brother as well as sister . 
At length as two or three tears had fallen upon the roses , and I had nearly laid my own face there , for very weariness and grief ; Kate softly put her arm round me and said , `` They are calling you , Gracie love ; -- good-night . '' 
I looked up , but without seeing a thing , -- felt their kisses upon my face , knew that Kate held me very close in her arms for a moment , and then that I was out of the house . 
Again the Cherokee roses were in full bloom , again the Baltimore birds fluttered about their nest ; again the long sunbeams came over the lake and fell softened upon the pretty bay-window ; -- but now at the open sash stood Mr. Rodney and Kate , watching me .
