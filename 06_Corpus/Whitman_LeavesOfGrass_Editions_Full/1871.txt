  INSCRIPTIONS. ONE'S-SELF I SING.1 
          ONE'S-SELF I sing—a simple, separate Person;Yet utter the word Democratic, the word  En-masse .2 
          Of Physiology from top to toe I sing;Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for         the muse—I say the Form complete is worthier         far;The Female equally with the male I sing.3 
          Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,Cheerful—for freest action form'd, under the laws di-         vine,The Modern Man I sing. AS I PONDER'D IN SILENCE.1AS I ponder'd in silence,Returning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,A Phantom arose before me, with distrustful aspect,Terrible in beauty, age, and power,The genius of poets of old lands,As to me directing like flame its eyes,With finger pointing to many immortal songs,And menacing voice,  What singest thou?  it said; Knowest thou not, there is but one theme for ever-enduring           bards?  And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,  The making of perfect soldiers? 2 Be it so,  then I answer'd, I too, haughty Shade, also sing war—and a longer and           greater one than any,  Waged in my book with varying fortune—with fight, ad-           vance, and retreat—Victory deferr'd and wavering,  (Yet, methinks, certain, or as good as certain, at the last,)           —The field the world;  For life and death—for the Body, and for the eternal Soul,  Lo! I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,  I, above all, promote brave soldiers . IN CABIN'D SHIPS AT SEA.1IN cabin'd ships, at sea,The boundless blue on every side expanding,With whistling winds and music of the waves—the         large imperious waves—In such,Or some lone bark, buoy'd on the dense marine,Where, joyous, full of faith, spreading white sails,She cleaves the ether, mid the sparkle and the foam of         day, or under many a star at night,By sailors young and old, haply will I, a reminiscence         of the land, be read,In full rapport at last.2 Here are our thoughts—voyagers' thoughts,  Here not the land, firm land, alone appears,  may then by         them be said; The sky o'erarches here—we feel the undulating deck be-           neath our feet,  We feel the long pulsation—ebb and flow of endless mo-           tion;  The tones of unseen mystery—the vague and vast sugges-           tions of the briny world—the liquid-flowing sylla-           bles,  The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melan-           choly rhythm,  The boundless vista, and the horizon far and dim, are all           here,  And this is Ocean's poem .3Then falter not, O book! fulfil your destiny!You, not a reminiscence of the land alone,You too, as a lone bark, cleaving the ether—purpos'd I         know not whither—yet ever full of faith,Consort to every ship that sails—sail you!Bear forth to them, folded, my love —(Dear mariners!         for you I fold it here, in every leaf;)Speed on, my Book! spread your white sails, my little         bark, athwart the imperious waves!Chant on—sail on—bear o'er the boundless blue, from         me, to every shore,This song for mariners and all their ships. TO FOREIGN LANDS.I HEARD that you ask'd for something to prove this         puzzle, the New World,And to define America, her athletic Democracy;Therefore I send you my poems, that you behold in         them what you wanted. TO A HISTORIAN.YOU who celebrate bygones!Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the         races—the life that has exhibited itself;Who have treated of man as the creature of politics,         aggregates, rulers and priests;I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is         in himself, in his own rights,Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited         itself, (the great pride of man in himself;)Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,I project the history of the future. FOR HIM I SING.FOR him I sing,I raise the Present on the Past,(As some perennial tree, out of its roots, the present on         the past:)With time and space I him dilate—and fuse the im-          mortal laws,To make himself, by them, the law unto himself. WHEN I READ THE BOOK.WHEN I read the book, the biography famous,And is this, then, (said I,) what the author calls a         man's life?And so will some one, when I am dead and gone, write         my life?(As if any man really knew aught of my life;Why, even I myself, I often think, know little or noth-         ing of my real life;Only a few hints—a few diffused, faint clues and indi-         rections,I seek, for my own use, to trace out here.) BEGINNING MY STUDIES.BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so         much,The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power         of motion,The least insect or animal—the senses—eyesight—         love;The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,I have hardly gone, and hardly wish'd to go, any far-         ther,But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic         songs. TO THEE, OLD CAUSE!1 
          To thee, old Cause!Thou peerless, passionate, good cause!Thou stern, remorseless, sweet Idea!Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands!After a strange, sad war—great war for thee,(I think all war through time was really fought, and         ever will be really fought, for thee;)These chants for thee—the eternal march of thee.2 
          Thou orb of many orbs!Thou seething principle! Thou well-kept, latent germ!Thou centre!Around the idea of thee the strange sad war revolv-         ing,With all its angry and vehement play of causes,(With yet unknown results to come, for thrice a thou-         sand years,)These recitatives for thee—my Book and the War are         one,Merged in its spirit I and mine—as the contest hinged         on thee,As a wheel on its axis turns, this Book, unwitting to         itself,Around the Idea of thee.  STARTING FROM PAUMANOK.11 
          STARTING from fish-shape Paumanok, where I was         born,Well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother;After roaming many lands—lover of populous pave-         ments;Dweller in Mannahatta, my city—or on southern sa-         vannas;Or a soldier camp'd, or carrying my knapsack and gun—         or a miner in California;Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat,         my drink from the spring;Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep re-         cess,Far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt         and happy;Aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri—         aware of mighty Niagara;Aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains—the         hirsute and strong-breasted bull;Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers, experienced—         stars, rain, snow, my amaze;Having studied the mocking-bird's tones, and the         mountain-hawk's,And heard at dusk the unrival'd one, the hermit thrush         from the swamp-cedars,Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New         World.22 
          Victory, union, faith, identity, time,The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.3 
          This, then, is life;Here is what has come to the surface after so many         throes and convulsions.4 
          How curious! how real!Underfoot the divine soil—overhead the sun.5 
          See, revolving, the globe;The ancestor-continents, away, group'd together;The present and future continents, north and south,         with the isthmus between.6 
          See, vast, trackless spaces;As in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill;Countless masses debouch upon them;They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts,         institutions, known.7 
          See, projected, through time,For me, an audience interminable.8 
          With firm and regular step they wend—they never stop,Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;One generation playing its part, and passing on;Another generation playing its part, and passing on in         its turn,With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me, to         listen,With eyes retrospective towards me.39 
          Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian;Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!For you a programme of chants.10 
          Chants of the prairies;Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to         the Mexican sea;Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and         Minnesota;Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and         thence, equi-distant,Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.411 
          In the Year 80 of The States,My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this         soil, this air,Born here of parents born here, from parents the same,         and their parents the same,I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health, begin,Hoping to cease not till death.12 
          Creeds and schools in abeyance,(Retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are, but         never forgotten,)I harbor, for good or bad—I permit to speak, at every         hazard,Nature now without check, with original energy.513 
          Take my leaves, America! take them, South, and take         them, North!Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your         own offspring;Surround them, East and West! for they would sur-         round you;And you precedents! connect lovingly with them, for         they connect lovingly with you.14 
          I conn'd old times:I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might return         and study me!15 
          In the name of These States, shall I scorn the an-         tique?Why These are the children of the antique, to jus-         tify it.616 
          Dead poets, philosophs, priests,Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,Language-shapers, on other shores,Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or         desolate,I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you         have left, wafted hither:I have perused it—own it is admirable, (moving awhile         among it;)Think nothing can ever be greater—nothing can ever         deserve more than it deserves;Regarding it all intently a long while—then dismiss-         ing it,I stand in my place, with my own day, here.17 
          Here lands female and male;Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world—here         the flame of materials;Here Spirituality, the translatress, the openly-avow'd,The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms;The satisfier, after due long-waiting, now advancing,Yes, here comes my mistress, the Soul.718 
          The SOUL:Forever and forever—longer than soil is brown and         solid—longer than water ebbs and flows.19 
          I will make the poems of materials, for I think they         are to be the most spiritual poems;And I will make the poems of my body and of mor-         tality,For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems         of my Soul, and of immortality.20 
          I will make a song for These States, that no one State         may under any circumstances be subjected to         another State;And I will make a song that there shall be comity by         day and by night between all The States, and         between any two of them;And I will make a song for the ears of the President,         full of weapons with menacing points,And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces:—And a song make I, of the One form'd out of all;The fang'd and glittering One whose head is over all;Resolute, warlike One, including and over all;(However high the head of any else, that head is over         all.)21 
          I will acknowledge contemporary lands;I will trail the whole geography of the globe, and sa-         lute courteously every city large and small;And employments! I will put in my poems, that with         you is heroism, upon land and sea;And I will report all heroism from an American point         of view.22 
          I will sing the song of companionship;I will show what alone must finally compact These;I believe These are to found their own ideal of manly         love, indicating it in me;I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that         were threatening to consume me;I will lift what has too long kept down those smoulder-         ing fires;I will give them complete abandonment;I will write the evangel-poem of comrades, and of love;(For who but I should understand love, with all its sor-         row and joy?And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)823 
          I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races;I advance from the people in their own spirit;Here is what sings unrestricted faith.24 
          Omnes! Omnes! let others ignore what they may;I make the poem of evil also—I commemorate that part         also;I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation         is—And I say there is in fact no evil;(Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to         the land, or to me, as anything else.)25 
          I too, following many, and follow'd by many, inau-         gurate a Religion—I descend into the arena;(It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there,         the winner's pealing shouts;Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above         every thing.)26 
          Each is not for its own sake;I say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are         for Religion's sake.27 
          I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough;None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and         how certain the future is.28 
          I say that the real and permanent grandeur of These         States must be their Religion;Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur:(Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without Reli-         gion;Nor land, nor man or woman, without Religion.)929 
          What are you doing, young man?Are you so earnest—so given up to literature, science,         art, amours?These ostensible realities, politics, points?Your ambition or business, whatever it may be?30 
          It is well—Against such I say not a word—I am         their poet also;But behold! such swiftly subside—  burnt up for Reli-         gion's sake;For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the         essential life of the earth,Any more than such are to Religion.1031 
          What do you seek, so pensive and silent?What do you need, Camerado?Dear son! do you think it is love?32 
          Listen, dear son—listen, America, daughter or son!It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess         —and yet it satisfies—it is great;But there is something else very great—it makes the         whole coincide;It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous         hands, sweeps and provides for all.1133 
          Know you! solely to drop in the earth the germs of         a greater Religion,The following chants, each for its kind, I sing.34 
          My comrade!For you, to share with me, two greatnesses—and a third         one, rising inclusive and more resplendent,The greatness of Love and Democracy—and the great-         ness of Religion.35 
          Melange mine own! the unseen and the seen;Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering         around me;Living beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the         air, that we know not of;Contact daily and hourly that will not release me;These selecting—these, in hints, demanded of me.36 
          Not he, with a daily kiss, onward from childhood         kissing me,Has winded and twisted around me that which holds         me to him,Any more than I am held to the heavens, to the spir-         itual world,And to the identities of the Gods, my lovers, faithful         and true,After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.37 
          O such themes! Equalities!O amazement of things! O divine average!O warblings under the sun—usher'd, as now, at noon,         or setting!O strain, musical, flowing through ages—now reaching         hither!I take to your reckless and composite chords—I add to         them, and cheerfully pass them forward.1238 
          As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walkI have seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, sat         on her nest in the briers, hatching her brood.39 
          I have seen the he-bird also;I have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his         throat, and joyfully singing.40 
          And while I paused, it came to me that what he         really sang for was not there only,Nor for his mate, nor himself only, nor all sent back by         the echoes;But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,A charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being         born.1341 
          Democracy!Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and         joyfully singing.42 
          Ma femme!For the brood beyond us and of us,For those who belong here, and those to come,I, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out         carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet         been heard upon earth.43 
          I will make the songs of passion, to give them their         way,And your songs, outlaw'd offenders—for I scan you         with kindred eyes, and carry you with me the         same as any.44 
          I will make the true poem of riches,To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres,         and goes forward, and is not dropt by death.45 
          I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all—and         I will be the bard of personality;And I will show of male and female that either is but         the equal of the other;And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me         —for I am determin'd to tell you with courageous         clear voice, to prove you illustrious;And I will show that there is no imperfection in the         present—and can be none in the future;And I will show that whatever happens to anybody, it         may be turn'd to beautiful results—and I will         show that nothing can happen more beautiful         than death;And I will thread a thread through my poems that time         and events are compact,And that all the things of the universe are perfect mira-         cles, each as profound as any.46 
          I will not make poems with reference to parts;But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says,         thoughts, with reference to ensemble:And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with         reference to all days;And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a         poem, but has reference to the Soul;(Because, having look'd at the objects of the universe,         I find there is no one, nor any particle of one,         but has reference to the Soul.)1447 
          Was somebody asking to see the Soul?See! your own shape and countenance—persons, sub-         stances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the         rocks and sands.48 
          All hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them:How can the real body ever die, and be buried?49 
          Of your real body, and any man's or woman's real body,Item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse-         cleaners, and pass to fitting spheres,Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of         birth to the moment of death.50 
          Not the types set up by the printer return their im-          pression, the meaning, the main concern,Any more than a man's substance and life, or a wo-         man's substance and life, return in the body and         the Soul,Indifferently before death and after. death.51 
          Behold! the body includes and is the meaning, the         main concern—and includes and is the Soul;Whoever you are! how superb and how divine is your         body, or any part of it.1552 
          Whoever you are! to you endless announcements.53 
          Daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poet?Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indica-         tive hand?54 
          Toward the male of The States, and toward the fe-         male of The States,Live words—words to the lands.55 
          O the lands! interlink'd, food-yielding lands!Land of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands of cot-         ton, sugar, rice!Land of wheat, beef, pork! Land of wool and hemp!         Land of the apple and grape!Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the         world! Land of those sweet-air'd interminable         plateaus!Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of         adobie!Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where         the south-west Colorado winds!Land of the eastern Chesapeake! Land of the Dela-         ware!Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! Land         of Vermont and Connecticut!Land of the ocean shores! Land of sierras and peaks!Land of boatmen and sailors! Fishermen's land!Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passion-         ate ones!The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the         bony-limb'd!The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced         sisters and the inexperienced sisters!Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd!         the diverse! the compact!The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Caro-         linian!O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations!         O I at any rate include you all with perfect love!I cannot be discharged from you! not from one, any         sooner than another!O Death! O for all that, I am yet of you, unseen, this         hour, with irrepressible love,Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer rip-         ples, on Paumanok's sands,Crossing the praries—dwelling again in Chicago—dwel-         ling in every town,Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,Listening to the orators and the oratresses in public         halls,Of and through The States, as during life—each man         and woman my neighbor,The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as         near to him and her,The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me—and I         yet with any of them;Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river—yet in my         house of adobie,Yet returning eastward—yet in the Sea-Side State, or         in Maryland,Yet Kanadian, cheerily braving the winter—the snow         and ice welcome to me,Yet a true son either of Maine, or of the Granite State,         or of the Narragansett Bay State, or of the         Empire State;Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same—yet         welcoming every new brother;Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones, from         the hour they unite with the old ones;Coming among the new ones myself, to be their com-         panion and equal—coming personally to you         now;Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.1656 
          With me, with firm holding—yet haste, haste on.57 
          For your life adhere to me!Of all the men of the earth, I only can unloose you         and toughen you;I may have to be persuaded many times before I con-         sent to give myself really to you—but what of         that?Must not Nature be persuaded many times?58 
          No dainty dolce affettuoso I;Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have         arrived,To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of         the universe;For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.1759 
          On my way a moment I pause;Here for you! and here for America!Still the Present I raise aloft—Still the Future of The         States I harbinge, glad and sublime;And for the Past, I pronounce what the air holds of         the red aborigines.60 
          The red aborigines!Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds,         calls as of birds and animals in the woods,         syllabled to us for names;Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez,         Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-         Walla;Leaving such to The States, they melt, they depart,         charging the water and the land with names.1861 
          O expanding and swift! O henceforth,Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and         audacious;A world primal again—Vistas of glory, incessant and         branching;A new race, dominating previous ones, and grander         far—with new contests,New politics, new literatures and religions, new in-         ventions and arts.62 
          These! my voice announcing—I will sleep no more,         but arise;You oceans that have been calm within me! how I         feel you, fathomless, stirring, preparing unpre-         cendented waves and storms.1963 
          See! steamers steaming through my poems!See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and         landing:See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut,         the flat-boat, the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude         fence, and the backwoods village;See, on the one side the Western Sea, and on the         other the Eastern Sea, how they advance and         retreat upon my poems, as upon their own         shores.See, pastures and forests in my poems—See, animals,         wild and tame—See, beyond the Kansas, count-         less herds of buffalo, feeding on short curly         grass;See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved         streets, with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless         vehicles, and commerce;See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press—See,         the electric telegraph, stretching across the         Continent, from the Western Sea to Manhat-         tan;See, through Atlantica's depths, pulses American,         Europe reaching—pulses of Europe, duly re-         turn'd;See, the strong and quick locomotive, as it departs,         panting, blowing the steam whistle;See, ploughmen, ploughing farms—See, miners, dig-         ging mines—See, the numberless factories;See, mechanics, busy at their benches, with tools—         See, from among them, superior judges, philo-         sophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in working         dresses;See, lounging through the shops and fields of The         States, me, well-belov'd, close-held by day and         night;Hear the loud echoes of my songs there! Read the         hints come at last.2064 
          O Camerado close!O you and me at last—and us two only.65 
          O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!O something extatic and undemonstrable! O music         wild!O now I triumph—and you shall also;O hand in hand—O wholesome pleasure—O one more         desirer and lover!O to haste, firm holding—to haste, haste on, with me. 27 THE SHIP STARTING.Lo! THE unbounded sea!On its breast a Ship starting, spreading all her sails—         an ample Ship, carrying even her moonsails;The pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds         so stately—  below, emulous waves press forward,They surround the Ship, with shining curving motions,         and foam. 28 UNFOLDED OUT OF THE FOLDS.UNFOLDED out of the folds of the woman, man comes         unfolded, and is always to come unfolded;Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth,         is to come the superbest man of the earth;Unfolded out of the friendliest woman, is to come the         friendliest man;Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman, can         a man be form'd of perfect body;Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of the wo-         man can come the poems of man—(only thence         have my poems come;)Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love,         only thence can appear the strong and arrogant         man I love;Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled         woman I love, only thence come the brawny em-         braces of the man;Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain, come         all the folds of the man's brain, duly obedient;Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice is         unfolded;Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sym-         pathy:A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through         eternity—but every jot of the greatness of man         is unfolded out of woman,First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be         shaped in himself. 28 TO YOU.STRANGER! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak         to me, why should you not speak to me?And why should I not speak to you?  WALT WHITMAN.11 
          I CELEBRATE myself;And what I assume you shall assume;For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to         you.2 
          I loafe and invite my Soul;I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of sum-         mer grass.3 
          Houses and rooms are full of perfumes—the shelves         are crowded with perfumes;I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it;The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall         not let it.4 
          The atmosphere is not a perfume—it has no taste ofthe distillation—it is odorless;It is for my mouth forever—I am in love with it;I will go to the bank by the wood, and become undis-         guised and naked;I am mad for it to be in contact with me.25 
          The smoke of my own breath;Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread,         crotch and vine;My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart,         the passing of blood and air through my lungs;The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the         shore, and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in         the barn;The sound of the belch'd words of my voice, words         loos'd to the eddies of the wind;A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around         of arms;The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple         boughs wag;The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or along         the fields and hill-sides;The feeling of health, the full noon-trill, the song of me         rising from bed and meeting the sun.6 
          Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you         reckon'd the earth much?Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of         poems?7 
          Stop this day and night with me, and you shall pos-         sess the origin of all poems;You shall possess the good of the earth and sun—(there         are millions of suns left;)You shall no longer take things at second or third         hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead,         nor feed on the spectres in books;You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take         things from me:You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from your-         self.38 
          I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk         of the beginning and the end;But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.9 
          There was never any more inception than there is         now,Nor any more youth or age than there is now;And will never be any more perfection than there is         now,Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.10 
          Urge, and urge, and urge;Always the procreant urge of the world.11 
          Out of the dimness opposite equals advance—always         substance and increase, always sex;Always a knit of identity—always distinction—always a         breed of life.12 
          To elaborate is no avail—learn'd and unlearn'd feel         that it is so.13 
          Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights,         well entretied, braced in the beams,Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,I and this mystery, here we stand.14 
          Clear and sweet is my Soul, and clear and sweet is all         that is not my Soul.15 
          Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by         the seen,Till that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its         turn.16 
          Showing the best, and dividing it from the worst         age vexes age;Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things,         while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and         admire myself.17 
          Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of         any man hearty and clean;Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none         shall be less familiar than the rest.18 
          I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side         through the night, and withdraws at the peep of         the day, with stealthy tread,Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels, swelling         the house with their plenty,Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and         scream at my eyes,That they turn from gazing after and down the road,And forthwith cipher and show me a cent,Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of         two, and which is ahead?419 
          Trippers and askers surround me;People I meet—the effect upon me of my early life, or         the ward and city I live in, or the nation,The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies,         authors old and new,My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman         I love,The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or ill-         doing, or loss or lack of money, or depressions         or exaltations;Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of         doubtful news, the fitful events;These come to me days and nights, and go from me         again,But they are not the Me myself.20 
          Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I         am;Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, uni-         tary;Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable         certain rest,Looking with side-curved head, curious what will come         next;Both in and out of the game, and watching and won-         dering at it.21 
          Backward I see in my own days where I sweated         through fog with linguists and contenders;I have no mockings or arguments—I witness and wait.522 
          I believe in you, my Soul—the other I am must not         abase itself to you;And you must not be abased to the other.23 
          Loafe with me on the grass—loose the stop from         your throat;Not words, not music or rhyme I want—not custom or         lecture, not even the best;Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.24 
          I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer         morning;How you settled your head athwart my hips, and gently         turn'd over upon me,And parted my shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged         your tongue to my bare-stript heart,And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you         held my feet.25 
          Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and         knowledge that pass all the argument of the         earth;And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my         own,And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my         own;And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,         and the women my sisters and lovers;And that a kelson of the creation is love;And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields;And brown ants in the little wells beneath them;And mossy scabs of the worm fence, and heap'd stones,         elder, mullen, and poke-weed.626 
          A child said,  What is the grass?  fetching it to me with         full hands;How could I answer the child? I do not know what it         is, any more than he.27 
          I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of         hopeful green stuff woven.28 
          Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that         we may see and remark, and say,  Whose? 29 
          Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced         babe of the vegetation.30 
          Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic;And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and nar-         row zones,Growing among black folks as among white;Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the         same, I receive them the same.31 
          And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of         graves.32 
          Tenderly will I use you, curling grass;It may be you transpire from the breasts of young         men;It may be if I had known them I would have loved         them;It may be you are from old people and from women,         and from offspring taken soon out of their         mothers' laps;And here you are the mothers' laps;33 
          This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of         old mothers;Darker than the colourless beards of old men;Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.34 
          O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of         mouths for nothing.35 
          I wish I could translate the hints about the dead         young men and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, and the         offspring taken soon out of their laps.36 
          What do you think has become of the young and         old men?And what do you think has become of the women and         children?37 
          They are alive and well somewhere;The smallest sprout shows there is really no death;And if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not         wait at the end to arrest it,And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.38 
          All goes onward and outward—nothing collapses;And to die is different from what any one supposed,         and luckier.739 
          Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die,         and I know it.40 
          I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-          wash'd babe, and am not contain'd between my         hat and boots;And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every         one good;The earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts         all good.41 
          I am not on earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;I am the mate and companion of people, all just as         immortal and fathomless as myself;(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)42 
          Every kind for itself and its own—for me mine, male         and female;For me those that have been boys, and that love         women;For me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings         to be slighted;For me the sweet-heart and the old maid—for me         mothers, and the mothers of mothers;For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears;For me children, and the begetters of children.43 
          Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor         discarded;I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether         or no;And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and         cannot be shaken away.844 
          The little one sleeps in its cradle;I lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently         brush away flies with my hand.45 
          The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up         the bushy hill;I peeringly view them from the top.46 
          The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-         room;I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair—I note         where the pistol has fallen.47 
          The blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-          soles, talk of the promenaders;The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating         thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the         granite floor;The snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of         snow-balls;The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd         mobs;The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside, borne         to the hospital;The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows         and fall;The excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly         working his passage to the centre of the crowd;The impassive stones that receive and return so many         echoes;What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sun-         struck, or in fits;What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who         hurry home and give birth to babes;What living and buried speech is always vibrating         here—what howls restrain'd by decorum;Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,         acceptances, rejections with convex lips;I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I         come, and I depart.948 
          The big doors of the country barn stand open and         ready;The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-         drawn wagon;The clear light plays on the brown gray and green         intertinged;The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.49 
          I am there—I help—I came stretch'd atop of the         load;I felt its soft jolts—one leg reclined on the other;I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and         timothy,And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of         wisps.1050 
          Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the         night,Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game;Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves, with my dog and         gun by my side.51 
          The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails—she cuts         the sparkle and scud;My eyes settle the land—I bend at her prow, or shout         joyously from the deck.52 
          The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt         for me;I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and         had a good time:(You should have been with us that day round the         chowder-kettle.)53 
          I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in         the far west—the bride was a red girl;Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and         dumbly smoking—they had moccasins to their         feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their         shoulders;On a bank lounged the trapper—he was drest mostly in         skins—his luxuriant beard and curls protected         his neck—he held his bride by the hand;She had long eyelashes—her head was bare—her coarse         straight locks descended upon her voluptuous         limbs and reach'd to her feet.54 
          The runaway slave came to my house and stopt out-         side;I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the wood-         pile;Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him         limpsy and weak,And went where he sat on a log, and led him in and         assured him,And brought water, and fill'd a tub for his sweated         body and bruis'd feet,And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and         gave him some coarse clean clothes,And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his         awkwardness,And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck         and ankles;He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and         pass'd north;(I had him sit next me at table—my fire-lock lean'd in         the corner.)1155 
          Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lone-         some.56 
          She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of         the window.57 
          Which of the young men does she like the best?Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.58 
          Where are you off to, lady? for I see you;You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in         your room.59 
          Dancing and laughing along the beach came the         twenty-ninth bather;The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved         them.60 
          The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it         ran from their long hair:Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.61 
          An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies;It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.62 
          The young men float on their backs—their white bel-          lies bulge to the sun—they do not ask who seizes         fast to them;They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant         and bending arch;They do not think whom they souse with spray.1263 
          The butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or         sharpens his knife at the stall in the market;I loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and         break-down.64 
          Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ         the anvil;Each has his main-sledge—they are all out—(there is         a great heat in the fire.)65 
          From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their         movements;The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their         massive arms;Over-hand the hammers swing—over-hand so slow—         over-hand so sure:They do not hasten—each man hits in his place.1366 
          The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses         —the block swags underneath on its tied-over         chain;The negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard—         steady and tall he stands, pois'd on one leg on         the string-piece;His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and         loosens over his hip-band;His glance is calm and commanding—he tosses the         slouch of his hat away from his forehead;The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache—falls         on the black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.67 
          I behold the picturesque giant, and love him—and I         do not stop there;I go with the team also.68 
          In me the caresser of life wherever moving—back-         ward as well as forward slueing;To niches aside and junior bending.69 
          Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the         leafy shade! what is that you express in your         eyes?It seems to me more than all the print I have read in         my life.70 
          My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on         my distant and day-long ramble;They rise together—they slowly circle around.71 
          I believe in those wing'd purposes,And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,And consider green and violet, and the tufted crown,         intentional;And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is         not something else;And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet         trills pretty well to me;And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of         me.1472 
          The wild gander leads his flock through the cool         night; Ya-honk!  he says, and sounds it down to me like an         invitation;(The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen         close;I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry         sky.)73 
          The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the         house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,The brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-         spread wings;I see in them and myself the same old law.74 
          The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred         affections;They scorn the best I can do to relate them.75 
          I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or         woods,Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders         of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses;I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.76 
          What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me;Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will         take me;Not asking the sky to come down to my good will;Scattering it freely forever.1577 
          The pure contralto sings in the organ loft;The carpenter dresses his plank—the tongue of his         foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp;The married and unmarried children ride home to their         Thanksgiving dinner;The pilot seizes the king-pin—he heaves down with a         strong arm;The mate stands braced in the whale-boat—lance and         harpoon are ready;The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches;The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the         altar;The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of         the big wheel;The farmer stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-         day loafe, and looks at the oats and rye;The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, a confirm'd         case,(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in         his mother's bedroom;)The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works         at his case,He turns his quid of tobacco, while his eyes blurr with         the manuscript;The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,What is removed drops horribly in a pail;The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand—the         drunkard nods by the bar-room stove;The machinist rolls up his sleeves—the policeman trav-         els his beat—the gate-keeper marks who pass;The young fellow drives the express-wagon—(I love         him, though I do not know him;)The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in         the race;The western turkey-shooting draws old and young—         some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his         position, levels his piece;The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf         or levee;As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer         views them from his saddle;The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run         for their partners, the dancers bow to each         other;The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret, and         harks to the musical rain;The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the         Huron;The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth, is offer-         ing moccasins and bead-bags for sale;The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with         half-shut eyes bent sideways;As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat, the plank         is thrown for the shore-going passengers;The young sister holds out the skein, while the elder         sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and         then for the knots;The one-year wife is recovering and happy, having a         week ago borne her first child;The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-         machine, or in the factory or mill;The nine months' gone is in the parturition chamber,         her faintness and pains are advancing;The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer—the         reporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book—         the sign-painter is lettering with red and gold;The canal-boy trots on the tow-path—the book-keeper         counts at his desk—the shoemaker waxes his         thread;The conductor beats time for the band, and all the per-         formers follow him;The child is baptized—the convert is making his first         professions;The regatta is spread on the bay—the race is begun—         how the white sails sparkle!The drover, watching his drove, sings out to them that         would stray;The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the pur-         chaser higgling about the odd cent;)The camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit         for her daguerreotype;The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand         of the clock moves slowly;The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-         open'd lips;The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on         her tipsy and pimpled neck;The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer         and wink to each other;(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths, nor jeer         you;)The President, holding a cabinet council, is surrounded         by the Great Secretaries;On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly         with twined arms;The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of hal-         ibut in the hold;The Missourian crosses the plains, toting his wares and         his cattle;As the fare-collector goes through the train, he gives         notice by the jingling of loose change;The floor-men are laying the floor—the tinners are         tinning the roof—the masons are calling for         mortar;In single file, each shouldering his hod, pass onward         the laborers;Seasons pursuing each other, the indescribable crowd is         gather'd—it is the Fourth of Seventh-month—         (What salutes of cannon and small arms!)Seasons pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the         mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the         ground;Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by         the hole in the frozen surface;The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter         strikes deep with his axe;Flatboatmen make fast, towards dusk, near the cotton-         wood or pekan-trees;Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river,         or through those drain'd by the Tennessee, or         through those of the Arkansaw;Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chatta-         hooche or Altamahaw;Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and         great-grandsons around them;In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and         trappers after their day's sport;The city sleeps, and the country sleeps;The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their         time;The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young hus-         band sleeps by his wife;And these one and all tend inward to me, and I tend         outward to them;And such as it is to be of these, more or less, I am.1678 
          I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the         wise;Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff'd with the         stuff that is fine;One of the Great Nation, the nation of many nations,         the smallest the same, and the largest the same;A southerner soon as a northerner—a planter non-         chalant and hospitable, down by the Oconee I         live;A Yankee, bound my own way, ready for trade, my         joints the limberest joints on earth, and the stern-         est joints on earth;A Kentuckian, walking the vale of the Elkhorn, in my         deer-skin leggings—a Louisianian or Georgian;A boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts—a         Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;At home on Kanadian snow-shoes, or up in the bush, or         with fishermen off Newfoundland;At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest         and tacking;At home on the hills of Vermont; or in the woods of         Maine, or the Texan ranch;Comrade of Californians—comrade of free north-west-         erners, (loving their big proportions;)Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen—comrade of all who         shake hands and welcome to drink and meat;A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thought-         fullest;A novice beginning, yet experient of myriads of sea-         sons;Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and reli-         gion;A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker;A prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.79 
          I resist anything better than my own diversity;I breathe the air, but leave plenty after me,And am not stuck up, and am in my place.80 
          (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place;The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are in their         place;The, palpable is in its place, and the impalpable is in its         place.)1781 
          These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and         lands—they are not original with me;If they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing,         or next to nothing;If they are not the riddle, and the untying of the riddle,         they are nothing;If they are not just as close as they are distant, they are         nothing.82 
          This is the grass that grows wherever the land is, and         the water is;This is the common air that bathes the globe.1883 
          With music strong I come—with my cornets and my         drums,I play not marches for accepted victors only—I play         great marches for conquered and slain persons.84 
          Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?I also say it is good to fall—battles are lost in the same         spirit in which they are won.85 
          I beat and pound for the dead;I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest         for them.86 
          Vivas to those who have fail'd!And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!And to those themselves who sank in the sea!And to all generals that lost engagements! and all over-         come heroes!And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the         greatest heroes known.1987 
          This is the meal equally set—this is the meat for         natural hunger;It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous—I         make appointments with all;I will not have a single person slighted or left away;The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited;The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited—the venerealee is in-         vited:There shall be no difference between them and the rest.88 
          This is the press of a bashful hand—this is the float         and odor of hair;This is the touch of my lips to yours—this is the mur-         mur of yearning:This is the far-off depth and height reflecting my own         face;This is the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet         again.89 
          Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?Well, I have—for the Fourth-month showers have, and         the mica on the side of a rock has.90 
          Do you take it I would astonish?Does the daylight astonish? Does the early redstart,         twittering through the woods?Do I astonish more than they?91 
          This hour I tell things in confidence;I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.2092 
          Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?93 
          What is a man, anyhow? What am I? What are you?94 
          All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own;Else it were time lost listening to me.95 
          I do not snivel that snivel the world over,That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow         and filth;That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at         the end but threadbare crape, and tears.96 
          Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for         invalids—conformity goes to the fourth-remov'd;I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out.97 
          Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be         ceremonious?98 
          Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair,         counsell'd with doctors, and calculated close,I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.99 
          In all people I see myself—none more, and not one a         barley-corn less;And the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them.100 
          And I know I am solid and sound;To me the converging objects of the universe perpetu-         ally flow;All are written to me, and I must get what the writing         means.101 
          I know I am deathless;I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the car-         penter's compass;I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with         a burnt stick at night.102 
          I know I am august;I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be         understood;I see that the elementary laws never apologize;(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant         my house by, after all.)103 
          I exist as I am—that is enough;If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;And if each and all be aware, I sit content;104 
          One world is aware, and by far the largest to me,         and that is myself;And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten         thousand or ten million years,I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness         I can wait.105 
          My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;I laugh at what you call dissolution;And I know the amplitude of time.21106 
          I am the poet of the Body;And I am the poet of the Soul.107 
          The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains         of hell are with me;The first I graft and increase upon myself—the latter I         translate into a new tongue.108 
          I am the poet of the woman the same as the man;And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man;And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of         men.100 
          I chant the chant of dilation or pride;We have had ducking and deprecating about enough;I show that size is only development.110 
          Have you outstript the rest? Are you the Presi-         dent?It is a trifle—they will more than arrive there, every         one, and still pass on.111 
          I am he that walks with the tender and growing         night;I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the night.112 
          Press close, bare-bosom'd night! Press close, mag-         netic, nourishing night!Night of south winds! night of the large few stars!Still, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night.113 
          Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breath'd earth!Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees;Earth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains,         misty-topt!Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged         with blue!Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river!Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clearer         for my sake!Far-swooping elbow'd earth! rich, apple-blossom'd         earth!Smile, for your lover comes!114 
          Prodigal, you have given me love! Therefore I to         you give love!O unspeakable, passionate love!22115 
          You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what         you mean;I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers;I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;We must have a turn together—I undress—hurry me         out of sight of the land;Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse;Dash me with amorous wet—I can repay you.116 
          Sea of stretch'd ground-swells!Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!Sea of the brine of life! sea of unshovell'd yet always-         ready graves!Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty         sea!I am integral with you—I too am of one phase, and of         all phases.117 
          Partaker of influx and efflux I—extoller of hate and         conciliation;Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in each others'         arms.118 
          I am he attesting sympathy;(Shall I make my list of things in the house, and skip         the house that supports them?)119 
          I am not the poet of goodness only—I do not decline         to be the poet of wickedness also.120 
          Washes and razors for foofoos—for me freckles and a         bristling beard.121 
          What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me—I stand         indifferent;My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait;I moisten the roots of all that has grown.122 
          Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging         pregnancy?Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd         over and rectified?123 
          I find one side a balance, and the antipodal side a         balance;Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine;Thoughts and deeds of the present, our rouse and early         start.124 
          This minute that comes to me over the past decil-         lions,There is no better than it and now.125 
          What behaved well in the past, or behaves well to-         day, is not such a wonder;The wonder is, always and always, how there can be a         mean man or an infidel.23126 
          Endless unfolding of words of ages!And mine a word of the modern—the word En-Masse.127 
          A word of the faith that never balks;Here or henceforward, it is all the same to me—I         accept Time, absolutely.128 
          It alone is without flaw—it rounds and completes         all;That mystic, baffling wonder I love, alone completes         all.120 
          I accept reality, and dare not question it;Materialism first and last imbuing.130 
          Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demon-          stration!Fetch stonecrop, mixt with cedar and branches of         lilac;This is the lexicographer—this the chemist—this made         a grammar of the old cartouches;These mariners put the ship through dangerous un-         known seas;This is the geologist—this works with the scalpel—and         this is a mathematician.131 
          Gentlemen! to you the first honors always:Your facts are useful and real—and yet they are not         my dwelling;(I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.)132 
           Less the reminders of properties told, my words;And more the reminders, they, of life untold, and of         freedom and extrication,And make short account of neuters and geldings, and         favor men and women fully equipt,And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives,         and them that plot and conspire.24133 
          Walt Whitman am I, a Kosmos, of mighty Manhat-         tan the son,Turbulent, fleshy and sensual, eating, drinking and         breeding;No sentimentalist—no stander above men and women,         or apart from them;No more modest than immodest.134 
          Unscrew the locks from the doors!Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!135 
          Whoever degrades another degrades me;And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.136 
          Through me the afflatus surging and surging—         through me the current and index.137 
          I speak the pass-word primeval—I give the sign of         democracy;By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have         their counterpart of on the same terms.138 
          Through me many long dumb voices;Voices of the interminable generations of slaves;Voices of prostitutes, and of deform'd persons;Voices of the diseas'd and despairing, and of thieves         and dwarfs;Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,And of the threads that connect the stars—and of         wombs and of the father-stuff,And of the rights of them the others are down upon;Of the trivial, flat, foolish, despised,Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.139 
          Through me forbidden voices;Voices of sexes and lusts—voices veil'd, and I remove         the veil;Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigur'd.140 
          I do not press my fingers across my mouth;I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the         head and heart;Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.141 
          I believe in the flesh and the appetites;Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part         and tag of me is a miracle.142 
          Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy what-         ever I touch or am touch'd from;The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer;This head more than churches, bibles, and all the         creeds.143 
          If I worship one thing more than another, it shall         be the spread of my own body, or any part of it.144 
          Translucent mould of me, it shall be you!Shaded ledges and rests, it shall be you!Firm masculine colter, it shall be you.145 
          Whatever goes to the tilth of me, it shall be you!You my rich blood! Your milky stream, pale strippings         of my life.146 
          Breast that presses against other breasts, it shall be         you!My brain, it shall be your occult convolutions.147 
          Root of wash'd sweet flag! timorous pond-snipe!         nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be         you!Trickling sap of maple! fibre of manly wheat! it shall         be you!148 
          Sun so generous, it shall be you!Vapors lighting and shading my face, it shall be you!You sweaty brooks and dews, it shall be you!Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me, it         shall be you!Broad, muscular fields! branches of live oak! loving         lounger in my winding paths! it shall be you!Hands I have taken—face I have kiss'd—mortal I have         ever touch'd! it shall be you.149 
          I dote on myself—there is that lot of me, and all so         luscious;Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills me with         joy.150 
          O I am wonderful!I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the         cause of my faintest wish;Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause         of the friendship I take again.151 
          That I walk up my stoop! I pause to consider if it         really be;A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than         the metaphysics of books.152 
          To behold the day-break!The little light fades the immense and diaphanous         shadows;The air tastes good to my palate.153 
          Hefts of the moving world, at innocent gambols,         silently rising, freshly exuding,Scooting obliquely high and low.154 
          Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous         prongs;Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.155 
          The earth by the sky staid with—the daily close of         their junction;The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over         my head;The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be         master!25156 
          Dazzling and tremendous, how quick the sun-rise         would kill me,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of         me.157 
          We also ascend, dazzling and tremendous as the         sun;We found our own, O my Soul, in the calm and cool         of the daybreak.158 
          My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach;With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds, and         volumes of worlds.159 
          Speech is the twin of my vision—it is unequal to         measure itself;It provokes me forever;It says sarcastically,  Walt, you contain enough—why           don't you let it out, then? 160 
          Come now, I will not be tantalized—you conceive         too much of articulation.161 
          Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath         you are folded?Waiting in gloom, protected by frost;The dirt receding before my prophetical screams;I underlying causes, to balance them at last;My knowledge my live parts—it keeping tally with the         meaning of things,HAPPINESS—which, whoever hears me, let him or her set         out in search of this day.162 
          My final merit I refuse you—I refuse putting from         me what I really am;Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me;I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking to-         ward you.163 
          Writing and talk do not prove me;I carry the plenum of proof, and everything else, in my         face;With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skep-         tic.26164 
          I think I will do nothing now but listen,To accrue what I hear into myself—to let sounds con-         tribute toward me.165 
          I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat,         gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my         meals;I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human         voice;I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or         following;Sounds of the city, and sounds out of the city—sounds         of the day and night;Talkative young ones to those that like them—the loud         laugh of work-people at their meals;The angry base of disjointed friendship—the faint tones         of the sick;The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips         pronouncing a death-sentence;The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the         wharves—the refrain of the anchor-lifters;The ring of alarm-bells—the cry of fire—the whirr of         swift-streaking engines and hose-carts, with pre-         monitory tinkles, and color'd lights;The steam-whistle—the solid roll of the train of ap-         proaching cars;The slow-march play'd at the head of the association,         marching two and two;(They go to guard some corpse—the flag tops are         draped with black muslin.)166 
          I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's         complaint;)I hear the key'd cornet—it glides quickly in through         my ears;It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and         breast.167 
          I hear the chorus—it is a grand opera;Ah, this indeed is music! This suits me.168 
          A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me;The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me         full.169 
          I hear the train'd soprano—(what work, with hers,         is this?)The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies;It wrenches such ardors from me, I did not know I         possess'd them;It sails me—I dab with bare feet—they are lick'd by         the indolent waves;I am exposed, cut by bitter and angry hail—I lose my         breath,Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throt-         tled in fakes of death;At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,And that we call BEING.27170 
          To be, in any form—what is that?(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back         thither;)If nothing lay more develop'd, the quahaug in its cal-         lous shell were enough.171 
          Mine is no callous shell;I have instant conductors all over me, whether I pass         or stop;They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through         me.172 
          I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am         happy;To touch my person to some one else's is about as much         as I can stand.28173 
          Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new iden-         tity,Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help         them,My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what         is hardly different from myself;On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,Depriving me of my best, as for a purpose,Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight         and pasture-fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze         at the edges of me;No consideration, no regard for my draining strength         or my anger;Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a         while,Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry         me.174 
          The sentries desert every other part of me;They have left me helpless to a red marauder;They all come to the headland, to witness and assist         against me.175 
          I am given up by traitors;I talk wildly—I have lost my wits—I and nobody else         am the greatest traitor;I went myself first to the headland—my own hands car-         ried me there.176 
          You villain touch! what are you doing? My breath         is tight in its throat;Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for me.29177 
          Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath'd, hooded,         sharp tooth'd touch!Did it make you ache so, leaving me?178 
          Parting, track'd by arriving—perpetual payment of         perpetual loan;Rich, showering rain, and recompense richer after-         ward.179 
          Sprouts take and accumulate—stand by the curb         prolific and vital:Landscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden.30180 
          All truths wait in all things;They neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist it;They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon;The insignificant is as big to me as any;(What is less or more than a touch?)181 
           Logic and sermons never convince;The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.182 
          Only what proves itself to every man and woman is         so;Only what nobody denies is so.183 
          A minute and a drop of me settle my brain;I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and         lamps,And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or         woman,And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have         for each other,And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson         until it becomes omnific,And until every one shall delight us, and we them.31184 
          I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-          work of the stars,And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand,         and the egg of the wren,And the tree-toad is a chef-d'uvre for the highest,And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of         heaven,And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all         machinery,And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses         any statue,And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of         infidels,And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at         the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and         baking short-cake.185 
          I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss,         fruits, grains, esculent roots,And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,And have distanced what is behind me for good rea-         sons,And call anything close again, when I desire it.186 
          In vain the speeding or shyness;In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against         my approach;In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd         bones;In vain objects stand leagues off, and assume manifold         shapes;In vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great         monsters lying low;In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky;In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs;In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods;In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador;I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of         the cliff.32187 
          I think I could turn and live with animals, they are         so placid and self-contain'd;I stand and look at them long and long.188 
          They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their         sins;They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God;Not one is dissatisfied—not one is demented with the         mania of owning things;Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived         thousands of years ago;Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole         earth.189 
          So they show their relations to me, and I accept         them;They bring me tokens of myself—they evince them         plainly in their possession.190 
           I wonder where they get those tokens:Did I pass that way huge times ago, and negligently         drop them?Myself moving forward then and now and forever,Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among         them;Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remem-         brancers;Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him         on brotherly terms.191 
          A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive         to my caresses,Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,Eyes full of sparkling wickedness—ears finely cut, flex-         ibly moving.192 
          His nostrils dilate, as my heels embrace him;His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we race         around and return.193 
          I but use you a moment, then I resign you, stallion;Why do I need your paces, when I myself out-gallop         them?Even, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you.33194 
          O swift wind! O space and time! now I see it is         true, what I guessed at;What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass;What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars         of the morning.195 
          My ties and ballasts leave me—I travel—I sail—my         elbows rest in the sea-gaps;I skirt the sierras—my palms cover continents;I am afoot with my vision.196 
          By the city's quadrangular houses—in log huts—         camping with lumbermen;Along the ruts of the turnpike—along the dry gulch         and rivulet bed;Weeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and         parsnips—crossing savannas—trailing in forests;Prospecting—gold-digging—girdling the trees of a new         purchase;Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand—hauling my boat         down the shallow river;Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead         —where the buck turns furiously at the hunter;Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock         —where the otter is feeding on fish;Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the         bayou;Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey—         where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-         shaped tail;Over the growing sugar—over the yellow-flower'd cotton         plant—over the rice in its low moist field;Over the shar-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd         scum and slender shoots from the gutters;Over the western persimmon—over the long-leav'd corn         —over the delicate blue-flower flax;Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and         buzzer there with the rest;Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades         in the breeze;Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, hold-         ing on by low scragged limbs;Walking the path worn in the grass, and beat through         the leaves of the brush;Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the         wheat-lot;Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve—where         the great gold-bug drops through the dark;Where flails keep time on the barn-floor;Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree         and flows to the meadow;Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremu-         lous shuddering of their hides;Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen—where         andirons straddle the hearth-slab—where cob-         webs fall in festoons from the rafters;Where trip-hammers crash—where the press is whirling         its cylinders;Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes         under its ribs;Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (float-         ing in it myself, and looking composedly down;)Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose—where         the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented         sand;Where the she-whale swims with her calf, and never         forsakes it;Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant         of smoke;Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of         the water;Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown cur-         rents,Where shells grow to her slimy deck—where the dead         are corrupting below;Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of         the regiments;Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching         island;Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my         countenance;Upon a door-step—upon the horse-block of hard wood         outside;Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a         good game of base-ball;At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license,         bull-dances, drinking, laughter;At the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown         mash, sucking the juice through a straw;At apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I         find;At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,         house-raisings:Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles,         cackles, screams, weeps;Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard—where the         dry-stalks are scattered—where the brood-cow         waits in the hovel;Where the bull advances to do his masculine work—         where the stud to the mare—where the cock is         treading the hen;Where the heifers browse—where geese nip their food         with short jerks;Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless         and lonesome prairie;Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the         square miles far and near;Where the humming-bird shimmers—where the neck of         the long-lived swan is curving and winding;Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where         she laughs her near-human laugh;Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden,         half hid by the high weeds;Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the         ground with their heads out;Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a         cemetery;Where winter wolves bark amidst wastes of snow and         icicled trees;Where the yellow-crowned heron comes to the edge of         the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs;Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the         warm noon;Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the         walnut-tree over the well:Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-         wired leaves;Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical         firs;Through the gymnasium—through the curtain'd saloon         —through the office or public hall;Pleas'd with the native, and pleas'd with the foreign—         pleas'd with the new and old;Pleas'd with women, the homely as well as the hand-         some;Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet         and talks melodiously;Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the white-wash'd         church;Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Metho-         dist preacher, or any preacher—impress'd seri-         ously at the camp-meeting:Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the         whole forenoon—flatting the flesh of my nose         on the thick plate-glass;Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up         to the clouds,My right and left arms round the sides of two friends,         and I in the middle:Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-         boy—(behind me he rides at the drape of the         day:)Far from the settlements, studying the print of animals'         feet, or the moccasin print;By the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a         feverish patient;Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with         a candle:Voyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure;Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle         as any;Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife         him;Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone         from me a long while;Walking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle         God by my side;Speeding through space—speeding through heaven and         the stars;Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring,         and the diameter of eighty thousand miles;Speeding with tail'd meteors—throwing fire balls like         the rest;Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full         mother in its belly;Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing;I tread day and night such roads.197 
          I visit the orchard of spheres, and look at the         product;And look at quintillions ripened, and look at quintillions         green.198 
          I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul;My course runs below the soundings of plummets.199 
          I help myself to material and immaterial;No guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me.200 
          I anchor my ship for a little while only;My messengers continually cruise away, or bring their         returns to me.201 
          I go hunting polar furs and the seal—leaping chasms         with a pike-pointed staff—clinging to topples of         brittle and blue.202 
          I ascend to the foretruck;I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest;We sail the arctic sea—it is plenty light enough;Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the         wonderful beauty;The enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them—         the scenery is plain in all directions;The white-topt mountains show in the distance—I fling         out my fancies towards them;(We are approaching some great battle-field in which         we are soon to be engaged;We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment—we         pass with still feet and caution;Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd         city;The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the         living cities of the globe.)203 
          I am a free companion—I bivouac by invading         watchfires.204 
          I turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the         bride myself;I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.205 
          My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail         of the stairs;They fetch my man's body up, dripping and drown'd.206 
          I understand the large hearts of heroes,The courage of present times and all times;How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck         of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and         down the storm;How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch,         and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,And chalk'd in large letters, on a board,  Be of good           cheer, we will not desert you :How he follow'd with them, and tack'd with them—and         would not give it up;How he saved the drifting company at last:How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated         from the side of their prepared graves;How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and         the sharp-lipp'd unshaved men:All this I swallow—it tastes good—I like it well—it         becomes mine;I am the man—I suffer'd—I was there.207 
          The disdain and calmness of olden martyrs;The mother, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry         wood, her children gazing on;The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the         fence, blowing, cover'd with sweat;The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck—         the murderous buckshot and the bullets;All these I feel, or am.208 
          I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the         dogs,Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack         the marksmen;I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd         with the ooze of my skin;I fall on the weeds and stones;The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,Taunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the         head with whip-stocks.209 
          Agonies are one of my changes of garments;I do not ask the wounded person how he feels—I my-         self become the wounded person;My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and         observe.210 
          I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken;Tumbling walls buried me in their debris;Heat and smoke I inspired—I heard the yelling shouts         of my comrades;I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;They have clear'd the beams away—they tenderly lift         me forth.211 
          I lie in the night air in my red shirt—the pervading         hush is for my sake;Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy;White and beautiful are the faces around me—the         heads are bared of their fire-caps;The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the         torches.212 
          Distant and dead resuscitate;They show as the dial or move as the hands of me—         I am the clock myself.213 
          I am an old artillerist—I tell of my fort's bombard-          ment;I am there again.214 
          Again the long roll of the drummers;Again the attacking cannon, mortars;Again, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.215 
          I take part—I see and hear the whole;The cries, curses, roar—the plaudits for well-aimed         shots;The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;Workmen searching after damages, making indispen-         sable repairs;The fall of grenades through the rent roof—the fan-         shaped explosion;The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in         the air.216 
          Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general—he         furiously waves with his hand;He gasps through the clot,  Mind not me—mind—the           entrenchments .34217 
          Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth;(I tell not the fall of Alamo,Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo;)'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hun-         dred and twelve young men.218 
          Retreating, they had form'd in a hollow square, with         their baggage for breastworks;Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's,         nine times their number, was the price they took         in advance;Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition         gone;They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd         writing and seal, gave up their arms, and march'd         back prisoners of war.219 
          They were the glory of the race of rangers;Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affec-         tionate,Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hun-         ters,Not a single one over thirty years of age.220 
          The second First-day morning they were brought         out in squads, and massacred—it was beautiful         early summer;The work commenced about five o'clock, and was over         by eight.221 
          None obey'd the command to kneel;Some made a mad and helpless rush—some stood stark         and straight;A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart—the liv-         ing and dead lay together;The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt—the new-         comers saw them there;Some, half-kill'd, attempted to crawl away;These were despatch'd with bayonets, or batter'd with         the blunts of muskets;A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till         two more came to release him;The three were all torn, and cover'd with the boy's         blood.222 
          At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies:That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and         twelve young men.35223 
          Would you hear of an old-fashion'd sea-fight?Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and         stars?List to the story as my grandmother's father, the sailor,         told it to me.224 
          Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said he;)His was the surly English pluck—and there is no         tougher or truer, and never was, and never will         be;Along the lower'd eve he came, horribly raking us.225 
          We closed with him—the yards entangled—the can-          non touch'd;My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.226 
          We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under         the water;On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at         the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up         overhead.227 
          Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark;Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks         on the gain, and five feet of water reported;The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in         the after-hold, to give them a chance for them-         selves.228 
          The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt         by the sentinels,They see so many strange faces, they do not know whom         to trust.229 
          Our frigate takes fire;The other asks if we demand quarter?If our colors are struck, and the fighting is done?230 
          Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little         captain, We have not struck,  he composedly cries,  we have just           begun our part of the fighting .231 
          Only three guns are in use;One is directed by the captain himself against the ene-         my's main-mast;Two, well served with grape and canister, silence his         musketry and clear his decks.232 
          The tops alone second the fire of this little battery,         especially the main-top;They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.233 
          Not a moment's cease;The leaks again fast on the pumps—the fire eats toward         the powder-magazine.234 
          One of the pumps has been shot away—it is gene-          rally thought we are sinking.235 
          Serene stands the little captain;He is not hurried—his voice is neither high nor low;His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lan-         terns.236 
          Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the         moon, they surrender to us.36237 
          Stretch'd and still lies the midnight;Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the dark-         ness;Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking—preparations to         pass to the one we have conquer'd;The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders         through a countenance white as a sheet;Near by, the corpse of the child that serv'd in the         cabin;The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and         carefully curl'd whiskers;The flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering         aloft and below;The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for         duty;Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves—         dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the         soothe of waves,Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels,         strong scent,Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and         fields by the shore, death-messages given in         charge to survivors,The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of         his saw,Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild         scream, and long, dull, tapering groan;These so—these irretrievable.37238 
          O Christ! This is mastering me!In at the conquer'd doors they crowd. I am possess'd.239 
          I embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering;See myself in prison shaped like another man,And feel the dull unintermitted pain.240 
          For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their car-         bines and keep watch;It is I let out in the morning, and barr'd at night.241 
          Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail, but I am         handcuff'd to him and walk by his side;(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one,         with sweat on my twitching lips.)242 
          Not a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up         too, and am tried and sentenced.243 
          Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I also         lie at the last gasp;My face is ash-color'd—my sinews gnarl—away from me         people retreat.244 
          Askers embody themselves in me, and I am embo-         died in them;I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.245 
          Enough! enough! enough!Somehow I have been stunn'd, Stand back!Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,         dreams, gaping;I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.246 
          That I could forget the mockers and insults!That I could forget the trickling tears, and the blows         of the bludgeons and hammers!That I could look with a separate look on my own cru-         cifixion and bloody crowning.247 
          I remember now;I resume the overstaid fraction;The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to         it, or to any graves;Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.248 
          I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one         of an average unending procession;Inland and sea-coast we go, and we pass all boundary         lines;Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole         earth;The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thou-         sands of years.249 
          Eleves, I salute you! come forward!Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.39250 
          The friendly and flowing savage, Who is he?Is he waiting for civilization, or past it, and master-         ing it?251 
          Is he some south-westerner, raised out-doors? Is he         Kanadian?Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon,         California? the mountains? prairie-life, bush-         life? or from the sea?252 
          Wherever he goes, men and women accept and de-         sire him;They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to         them, stay with them.253 
          Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as         grass, uncomb'd head, laughter, and naivete,Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes         emanations;They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers;They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath—         they fly out of the glance of his eyes.40254 
          Flaunt of the sunshine, I need not your bask,—lie         over!You light surfaces only—I force surfaces and depths         also.255 
          Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands;Say, old Top-knot! what do you want?256 
          Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but         cannot;And might tell what it is in me, and what it is in you,         but cannot;And might tell that pining I have—that pulse of my         nights and days.257 
          Behold! I do not give lectures, or a little charity;When I give, I give myself.258 
          You there, impotent, loose in the knees!Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you;Spread your palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets;I am not to be denied—I compel—I have stores? plenty         and to spare;And anything I have I bestow.259 
          I do not ask who you are—that is not so important         to me;You can do nothing, and be nothing, but what I will         infold you.260 
          To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean;On his right cheek I put the family kiss,And in my soul I swear, I never will deny him.261 
          On women fit for conception I start bigger and         nimbler babes;(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant         republics.)262 
          To any one dying—thither I speed, and twist the         knob of the door;Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed;Let the physician and the priest go home.263 
          I seize the descending man, and raise him with re-          sistless will.264 
          O despairer, here is my neck;By God! you shall not go down! Hang your whole         weight upon me.265 
          I dilate you with tremendous breath—I buoy you         up;Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.266 
          Sleep! I and they keep guard all night;Not doubt—not decease shall dare to lay finger upon         you;I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to         myself;And when you rise in the mornng you will find what I         tell you is so.41267 
          I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on         their backs;And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed         help.268 
          I heard what was said of the universe;Heard it and heard it of several thousand years:It is middling well as far as it goes,—But is that all?269 
          Magnifying and applying come I,Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his         grandson;Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf,         the crucifix engraved,With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every         idol and image;Taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent         more;Admitting they were alive and did the work of their         days;(They bore mites, as for unfledg'd birds, who have now         to rise and fly and sing for themselves;)Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in         myself—bestowing them freely on each man and         woman I see;Discovering as much, or more, in a framer framing a         house;Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up         sleeves, driving the mallet and chisel;Not objecting to special revelations—considering a curl         of smoke, or a hair on the back of my hand, just         as curious as any revelation;Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes         no less to me than the Gods of the antique wars;Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruc-         tion,Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths—         their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of         the flames:By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple in-         terceding for every person born;Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three         lusty angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists;The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins         past and to come,Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers         for his brother, and sit by him while he is tried         for forgery;What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square         rod about me, and not filling the square rod         then;The bull and the bug never worship'd half enough;Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd;The supernatural of no account—myself waiting my         time to be one of the Supremes;The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much         good as the best, and be as prodigious:By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator;Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of         the shadows.42270 
          A call in the midst of the crowd;My own voice, orotund, sweeping, and final.271 
          Come my children;Come my boys and girls, my women, household, and         intimates;Now the performer launches his nerve—he has pass'd         his prelude on the reeds within.272 
          Easily written, loose-finger'd chords! I feel the thrum         of your climax and close.273 
          My head slues round on my neck;Music rolls, but not from the organ;Folks are around me, but they are no household of         mine.274 
          Ever the hard, unsunk ground;Ever the eaters and drinkers—ever the upward and         downward sun—ever the air and the ceaseless         tides;Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real;Ever the old inexplicable query—ever that thorn'd         thumb—that breath of itches and thirsts;Ever the vexer's  hoot! hoot!  till we find where the sly         one hides, and bring him forth;Ever love—ever the sobbing liquid of life;Ever the bandage under the chin—ever the tressels of         death.275 
          Here and there, with dimes on the eyes, walking;To feed the greed of the belly, the brains liberally         spooning;Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never         once going;Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff         for payment receiving;A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually         claiming.276 
          This is the city, and I am one of the citizens;Whatever interests the rest interests me—politics, wars,         markets, newspapers, schools,Benevolent societies, improvements, banks, tariffs,         steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate,         and personal estate.277 
          The little plentiful mannikins, skipping around in         collars and tail'd coats,I am aware who they are—(they are positively not         worms or fleas.)278 
          I acknowledge the duplicates of myself—the weakest         and shallowest is deathless with me;What I do and say, the same waits for them;Every thought that flounders in me, the same flounders         in them.279 
          I know perfectly well my own egotism;I know my omnivorous lines, and will not write any         less;And would fetch you, whoever you are, flush with         myself;280 
          No words of routine are mine,But abruptly to question, to leap beyond, yet nearer         bring:This printed and bound book—but the printer, and the         printing-office boy?The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend         close and solid in your arms?The black ship, mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in         her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and         engineers?In the houses, the dishes and fare and furniture—but         the host and hostess, and the look-out of their         eyes?The sky up there—yet here, or next door, or across the         way?The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human         brain,And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?43281 
          I do not despise you, priests;My faith is the greatest of faiths, and the least of faiths,Enclosing worship ancient and modern, and all between         ancient and modern,Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five         thousand years,Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the Gods,         saluting the sun,Making a fetish of the first rock or stump, powwowing         with sticks in the circle of obis,Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of         the idols,Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic proces-         sion—rapt and austere in the woods, a gymno-         sophist,Drinking mead from the skull-cup—to Shastas and         Vedas admirant—minding the Koran,Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone         and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,Accepting the Gospels—accepting him that was cruci-         fied, knowing assuredly that he is divine,To the mass kneeling, or the puritan's prayer rising, or         sitting patiently in a pew,Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting         dead-like till my spirit arouses me,Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of         pavement and land,Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.282 
          One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang, I turn         and talk, like a man leaving charges before a         journey.283 
          Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded,Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,         atheistical;I know every one of you—I know the sea of torment,         doubt, despair and unbelief.284 
          How the flukes splash!How they contort, rapid as lightning, with spasms, and         spouts of blood!285 
          Be at peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen         mopers;I take my place among you as much as among any;The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me,         all, precisely the same.286 
          I do not know what is untried and afterward;But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and can-         not fail.287 
          Each who passes is consider'd—each who stops is         consider'd—not a single one can it fail.288 
          It cannot fail the young man who died and was         buried,Nor the young woman who died and was put by his         side,Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then         drew back, and was never seen again,Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and         feels it with bitterness worse than gall,Nor him in the poor house, tubercled by rum and the         bad disorder,Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd—nor the         brutish koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food         to slip in,Nor anything in the earth, or down in the oldest graves         of the earth,Nor anything in the myriads of spheres—nor one of         the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,Nor the present—nor the least wisp that is known.44289 
          It is time to explain myself—Let us stand up.290 
          What is known I strip away;I launch all men and women forward with me into THE         UNKNOWN.291 
          The clock indicates the moment—but what does eter-          nity indicate?292 
          We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and         summers;There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.293 
          Births have brought us richness and variety,And other births will bring us richness and variety.294 
          I do not call one greater and one smaller;That which fills its period and place is equal to any.295 
          Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my         brother, my sister?I am sorry for you—they are not murderous or jealous         upon me;All has been gentle with me—I keep no account with         lamentation;(What have I to do with lamentation?)296 
          I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an en-         closer of things to be.297 
          My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs;On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches be-         tween the steps;All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.298 
          Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me;Afar down I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was         even there;I waited unseen and always, and slept through the leth-         argic mist,And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid         carbon.299 
          Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.300 
          Immense have been the preparations for me,Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.301 
          Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like         cheerful boatmen;For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings;They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.302 
          Before I was born out of my mother, generations         guided me;My embryo has never been torpid—nothing could over-         lay it.303 
          For it the nebula cohered to an orb,The long slow strata piled to rest it on,Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and         deposited it with care.304 
          All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete         and delight me;Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul.45305 
          O span of youth! Ever-push'd elasticity!O manhood, balanced, florid, and full.306 
          My lovers suffocate me!Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,Jostling me through streets and public halls—coming         naked to me at night,Crying by day  Ahoy!  from the rocks of the river—         swinging and chirping over my head,Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled under-         brush,Lighting on every moment of my life,Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts, and         giving them to be mine.307 
          Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace         of dying days!308 
          Every condition promulges not only itself—it pro-          mulges what grows after and out of itself,And the dark hush promulges as much as any.309 
          I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled         systems,And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge         but the rim of the farther systems.310 
          Winder and wider they spread, expanding, always ex-          panding,Outward and outward, and forever outward.311 
          My sun has his sun, and round him obediently         wheels,He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest         inside them.312 
          There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage;If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their         surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a         pallid float, it would not avail in the long run;We should surely bring up again where we now stand,And as surely go as much farther—and then farther and         farther.313 
          A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic         leagues, do not hazard the span, or make it im-         patient;They are but parts—anything is but a part.314 
          See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that;Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.315 
          My rendezvous is appointed—it is certain;The Lord will be there, and wait till I come, on perfect         terms;(The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine,         will be there.)46316 
          I know I have, the best of time and space, and wasnever measured, and never will be measured.317 
          I tramp a perpetual journey—(come listen all!)My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff         cut from the woods;No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair;I have no chair, no church, no philosophy;I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, or exchange;But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a         knoll,My left hand hooking you round the waist,My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents,         and a plain public road.318 
          Not I—not any one else, can travel that road for         you,You must travel it for yourself.319 
          It is not far—it is within reach;Perhaps you have been on it since you were born, and         did not know;Perhaps it is every where on water and on land.320 
          Shoulder your duds, dear son, and I will mine, and         let us hasten forth,Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as         we go.321 
          If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff         of your hand on my hip,And in due time you shall repay the same service to         me;For after we start, we never lie by again.322 
          This day before dawn I ascended a hill, and look'd at         the crowded heaven,And I said to my Spirit,  When we become the enfolders           of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of           everything in them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied           then? And my Spirit said,  No, we but level that lift, to pass and           continue beyond .323 
          You are also asking me questions, and I hear you;I answer that I cannot answer—you must find out for         yourself.324 
          Sit a while, dear son;Here are biscuits to eat, and here is milk to drink;But as soon as you sleep, and renew yourself in sweet         clothes, I kiss you with a good-bye kiss, and open         the gate for your egress hence.325 
          Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams;Now I wash the gum from your eyes;You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light, and         of every moment of your life.326 
          Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by         the shore;Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to         me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.47327 
          I am the teacher of athletes;He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own,         proves the width of my own;He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy         the teacher.328 
          The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not         through derived power, but in his own right,Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than         sharp steel cuts,First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a         skiff, to sing a song, or play on the banjo,Preferring scars, and the beard, and faces pitted with         small-pox, over all latherers,And those well tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.329 
          I teach straying from me—yet who can stray from         me?I follow you, whoever you are, from the present hour;My words itch at your ears till you understand them.330 
          I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the         time while I wait for a boat;It is you talking just as much as myself—I act as the         tongue of you;Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.331 
          I swear I will never again mention love or death in-         side a house,And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to         him or her who privately stays with me in the         open air.332 
          If you would understand me, go to the heights or         water-shore;The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or mo-         tion of waves a key;The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.333 
          No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,But roughs and little children better than they.334 
          The young mechanic is closest to me—he knows me         well;The woodman, that takes his axe and jug with him,         shall take me with him all day;The farm-boy, ploughing in the field, feels good at the         sound of my voice;In vessels that sail, my words sail—I go with fishermen         and seamen, and love them.335 
          The soldier camp'd, or upon the march, is mine;On the night ere the pending battle, many seek me, and         I do not fail them;On the solemn night (it may be their last,) those that         know me, seek me.336 
          My face rubs to the hunter's face, when he lies down         alone in his blanket;The driver, thinking of me, does not mind the jolt of         his wagon;The young mother and old mother comprehend me;The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment, and         forget where they are;They and all would resume what I have told them.48337 
          I have said that the soul is not more than the body,And I have said that the body is not more than the soul;And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's-         self is,And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, walks         to his own funeral, drest in his shroud,And I or you, pocketless of a dime, may purchase the         pick of the earth,And to glance with an eye, or show a bean in its pod,         confounds the learning of all times,And there is no trade or employment but the young         man following it may become a hero,And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the         wheel'd universe,And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand         cool and composed before a million universes.338 
          And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about         God;(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about         God, and about death.)339 
          I hear and behold God in every object, yet under-         stand God not in the least,Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful         than myself.340 
          Why should I wish to see God better than this day?I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four,         and each moment then;In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my         own face in the glass;I find letters from God dropt in the street—and every         one is sign'd by God's name,And I leave them where they are, for I know that         wheresoe'er I go,Others will punctually come forever and ever.49341 
          And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortal-         ity, it is idle to try to alarm me.342 
          To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes;I see the elder-hand, pressing, receiving, supporting;I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.343 
          And as to you, Corpse, I think you are good manure         —but that does not offend me;I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,I reach to the leafy lips—I reach to the polish'd breasts         of melons.344 
          And as to you Life, I reckon you are the leavings of         many deaths;(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times         before.)345 
          I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven;O suns! O grass of graves! O perpetual transfers and         promotions!If you do not say anything, how can I say anything?346 
          Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing         twilight,Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! toss on the black stems         that decay in the muck!Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.347 
          I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night;I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams         reflected;And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring         great or small,50348 
          There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but         I know it is in me.349 
          Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body         becomes;I sleep—I sleep long.350 
          I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word         unsaid;It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.351 
          Something it swings on more than the earth I swing         on;To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes         me.352 
          Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for         my brothers and sisters.353 
          Do you see, O my brothers and sisters?It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is         eternal life—it is HAPPINESS.51354 
          The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emp-          tied them,And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.355 
          Listener up there! Here, you! What have you to         confide to me?Look in my face, while I snuff the sidle of evening;Talk honestly—no one else hears you, and I stay only a         minute longer.356 
          Do I contradict myself?Very well, then, I contradict myself;(I am large—I contain multitudes.)357 
          I concentrate toward them that are nigh—I wait on         the door-slab. 96 LAWS FOR CREATIONS.1 
          LAWS for Creations,For strong artists and leaders—for fresh broods of         teachers, and perfect literats for America,For noble savans, and coming musicians.2 
          All must have reference to the ensemble of the world,         and the compact truth of the world;There shall be no subject too pronounced—All works         shall illustrate the divine law of indirections.3 
          What do you suppose Creation is?What do you suppose will satisfy the Soul, except to         walk free, and own no superior?What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hun-         dred ways, but that man or woman is as good as         God?And that there is no God any more divine than Your-         self?And that that is what the oldest and newest myths         finally mean?Aud that you or any one must approach Creations         through such laws? 96 VISOR'D.A MASK—a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,Concealing her face, concealing her form,Changes and transformations every hour, every mo-         ment,Falling upon her even when she sleeps.  CHILDREN OF ADAM. TO THE GARDEN, THE WORLD.TO THE garden, the world, anew ascending,Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,Curious, here behold my resurrection, after slumber;The revolving cycles, in their wide sweep, having brought         me again,Amorous, mature—all beautiful to me—all wondrous;My limbs, and the quivering fire that ever plays through         them, for reasons, most wondrous;Existing, I peer and penetrate still,Content with the present—content with the past,By my side, or back of me, Eve following,Or in front, and I following her just the same. FROM PENT-UP ACHING RIVERS.FROM pent-up, aching rivers;From that of myself, without which I were nothing;From what I am determin'd to make illustrious, even         if I stand sole among men;From my own voice resonant—singing the phallus,Singing the song of procreation,Singing the need of superb children, and therein superb         grown people,Singing the muscular urge and the blending,Singing the bedfellow's song, (O resistless yearning!O for any and each, the body correlative attracting!O for you, whoever you are, your correlative body! O         it, more than all else, you delighting!)—From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and         day;From native moments—from bashful pains—singing         them;Singing something yet unfound, though I have dili-         gently sought it, many a long year;Singing the true song of the Soul, fitful, at random;Singing what, to the Soul, entirely redeem'd her, the         faithful one, even the prostitute, who detain'd         me when I went to the city;Singing the song of prostitutes;Renascent with grossest Nature, or among animals;Of that—of them, and what goes with them, my poems         informing;Of the smell of apples and lemons—of the pairing of         birds,Of the wet of woods—of the lapping of waves,Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land—I them         chanting;The overture lightly sounding—the strain anticipat-         ing;The welcome nearness—the sight of the perfect body;The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motion-         less on his back lying and floating;The female form approaching—I, pensive, love-flesh         tremulous, aching;The divine list, for myself or you, or for any one, mak-         ing;The face—the limbs—the index from head to foot, and         what it arouses;The mystic deliria—the madness amorous—the utter         abandonment;(Hark close, and still, what I now whisper to you,I love you—O you entirely possess me,O I wish that you and I escape from the rest, and go         utterly off—O free and lawless,Two hawks in the air—two fishes swimming in the sea         not more lawless than we;)—The furious storm through me careering—I passion-         ately trembling;The oath of the inseparableness of two together—of the         woman that loves me, and whom I love more than         my life—that oath swearing;(O I willingly stake all, for you!O let me be lost, if it must be so!O you and I—what is it to us what the rest do or         think?What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other,         and exhaust each other, if it must be so:)—From the master—the pilot I yield the vessel to;The general commanding me, commanding all—from         him permission taking;From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter'd         too long, as it is;)From sex—From the warp and from the woof;(To talk to the perfect girl who understands me,To waft to her these from my own lips—to effuse them         from my own body;)From privacy—from frequent repinings alone;From plenty of persons near, and yet the right person         not near;From the soft sliding of hands over me, and thrusting         of fingers through my hair and beard;From the long sustain'd kiss upon the mouth or         bosom;From the close pressure that makes me or any man         drunk, fainting with excess;From what the divine husband knows—from the work         of fatherhood;From exultation, victory, and relief—from the bedfel-         low's embrace in the night;From the act-poems of eyes, hands, hips, and bosoms,From the cling of the trembling arm,From the bending curve and the clinch,From side by side, the pliant coverlid off-throwing,From the one so unwilling to have me leave—and me         just as unwilling to leave,(Yet a moment, O tender waiter, and I return;)—From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,From the night, a moment, I, emerging, flitting out,Celebrate you, act divine—and you, children prepared         for,And you, stalwart loins. I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC.11 
          I SING the Body electric;The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth         them;They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to         them,And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the         charge of the Soul.2 
          Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own         bodies conceal themselves?And if those who defile the living are as bad as they         who defile the dead?And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?23 
          The love of the Body of man or woman balks ac-         count—the body itself balks account;That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is         perfect.4 
          The expression of the face balks account;But the expression of a well-made man appears not         only in his face;It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the         joints of his hips and wrists;It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his         waist and knees—dress does not hide him;The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through         the cotton and flannel;To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem,         perhaps more;You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck         and shoulder-side.5 
          The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and         heads of women, the folds of their dress, their         style as we pass in the street, the contour of         their shape downwards,The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he         swims through the transparent green-shine, or         lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro         in the heave of the water,The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-         boats—the horseman in his saddle,Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their         open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,The female soothing a child—the farmer's daughter in         the garden or cow-yard,The young fellow hoeing corn—the sleigh-driver guiding         his six horses through the crowd,The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite         grown, lusty, good natured, native-born, out on         the vacant lot at sun-down, after work,The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love         and resistance,The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over         and blinding the eyes;The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play         of masculine muscle through clean-setting trow-         sers and waist-straps,The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell         strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the         alert,The natural, perfect, varied attitudes—the bent head,         the curv'd neck, and the counting;Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the         mother's breast with the little child,Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march         in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, and         count.36 
          I knew a man, a common farmer—the father of five         sons;And in them were the fathers of sons—and in them         were the fathers of sons.7 
          This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of         person;The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his         hair and beard, and the immeasurable meaning of         his black eyes—the richness and breadth of his         manners,These I used to go and visit him to see—he was wise         also;He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old—his         sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced,         handsome;They and his daughters loved him—all who saw him         loved him;They did not love him by allowance—they loved him         with personal love!He drank water only—the blood show'd like scarlet         through the clear-brown skin of his face;He was a frequent gunner and fisher—he sail'd his boat         himself—he had a fine one presented to him by         a ship-joiner—he had fowling-pieces, presented to         him by men that loved him;When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons         to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the         most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,You would wish long and long to be with him—you         would wish to sit by him in the boat, that you         and he might touch each other.48 
          I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing,         laughing flesh is enough,To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm         ever so lightly round his or her neck for a mo-         ment—what is this, then?I do not ask any more delight—I swim in it, as in a sea.9 
          There is something in staying close to men and women,         and looking on them, and in the contact and         odor of them, that pleases the soul well;All things please the soul—but these please the soul         well.510 
          This is the female form;A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a         helpless vapor—all falls aside but myself and it;Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth,         the atmosphere and the clouds, and what was         expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now         consumed;Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it—the         response likewise ungovernable;Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands,         all diffused—mine too diffused;Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb—         love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching;Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quiver-         ing jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice;Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly         into the prostrate dawn;Undulating into the willing and yielding day,Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.11 
          This is the nucleus—after the child is born of woman,         the man is born of woman;This is the bath of birth—this is the merge of small         and large, and the outlet again.12 
          Be not ashamed, women—your privilege encloses the         rest, and is the exit of the rest;You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of         the soul.13 
          The female contains all qualities, and tempers them         —she is in her place, and moves with perfect         balance;She is all things duly veil'd—she is both passive and         active;She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons         as well as daughters.14 
          As I see my soul reflected in nature;As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible com-         pleteness and beauty,See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast—         the female I see.615 
          The male is not less the soul, nor more—he too is in         his place;He too is all qualities—he is action and power;The flush of the known universe is in him;Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance be-         come him well:The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sor-         row that is utmost, become him well—pride is         for him;The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent         to the soul;Knowledge becomes him—he likes it always—he brings         everything to the test of himself;Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he         strikes soundings at last only here;(Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)16 
          The man's body is sacred, and the woman's body is         sacred;No matter who it is, it is sacred;Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants         just landed on the wharf?Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the         well off—just as much as you;Each has his or her place in the procession.17 
          (All is a procession;The universe is a procession, with measured and beau-         tiful motion.)18 
          Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave         or the dull-face ignorant?Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and         he or she has no right to a sight?Do you think matter has cohered together from its dif-         fuse float—and the soil is on the surface, and         water runs, and vegetation sprouts,For you only, and not for him and her?719 
          A man's Body at auction;I help the auctioneer—the sloven does not half know         his business.20 
          Gentlemen, look on this wonder!Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high         enough for it;For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years,         without one animal or plant;For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.21 
          In this head the all-baffling brain;In it and below it, the makings of heroes.22 
          Examine these limbs, red, black, or white—they are         so cunning in tendon and nerve;They shall be stript, that you may see them.23 
          Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh         not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,And wonders within there yet.24 
          Within there runs blood,The same old blood!The same red-running blood!There swells and jets a heart—there all passions, de-         sires, reachings, aspirations;Do you think they are not there because they are not         express'd in parlors and lecture-rooms?25 
          This is not only one man—this is the father of those         who shall be fathers in their turns;In him the start of populous states and rich republics;Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embod-         iments and enjoyments.26 
          How do you know who shall come from the offspring         of his offspring through the centuries?Who might you find you have come from yourself, if         you could trace back through the centuries?827 
          A woman's Body at auction!She too is not only herself—she is the teeming mother         of mothers;She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates         to the mothers.28 
          Have you ever loved the Body of a woman?Have you ever loved the Body of a man?Your father—where is your father?Your mother—is she living? have you been much with         her? and has she been much with you?—Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all,         in all nations and times, all over the earth?29 
          If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of man-         hood untainted;And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body,         is beautiful as the most beautiful face.30 
          Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live         body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal         themselves.931 
          O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in         other men and women, nor the likes of the parts         of you;I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the         likes of the Soul, (and that they are the Soul;)I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my         poems—and that they are poems,Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's,         mother's, father's, young man's, young woman's         poems;Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the         waking or sleeping of the lids,Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and         the jaw-hinges,Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the         neck, neck-slue,Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders,         and the ample side-round of the chest.Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-         sinews, arm-bones,Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb,         fore-finger, finger-balls, finger-joints, finger-nails,Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-         bone, breast-side,Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone,Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward         round, man-balls, man-root,Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg,Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of         my or your body, or of any one's body, male or         female,The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet         and clean,The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, ma-         ternity,Womanhood, and all that is a woman—and the man         that comes from woman,The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laugh-         ter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and         risings,The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting         aloud,Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking,         swimming,Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-         curving, and tightening,The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and         around the eyes,The skin, the sun burnt shade, freckles, hair,The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the         hand the naked meat of the body,The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out,The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and         thence downward toward the knees,The thin red jellies within you, or within me—the bones,         and the marrow in the bones,The exquisite realization of health;O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body         only, but of the Soul,O I say now these are the Soul! A WOMAN WAITS FOR ME.1 
          A WOMAN waits for me—she contains all, nothing is         lacking,Yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or if the mois-         ture of the right man were lacking.2 
          Sex contains all,Bodies, Souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, re-         sults, promulgations,Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery,         the seminal milk;All hopes, benefactions, bestowals,All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of         the earth,These are contain'd in sex, as parts of itself, and justi-         fications of itself.3 
          Without shame the man I like knows and avows the         deliciousness of his sex,Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.4 
          Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those         women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for         me;I see that they understand me, and do not deny me;I see that they are worthy of me—I will be the robust         husband of those women.5 
          They are not one jot less than I am,They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blow-         ing winds,Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run,         strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend them-         selves,They are ultimate in their own right—they are calm,         clear, well-possess'd of themselves.6 
          I draw you close to me, you women!I cannot let you go, I would do you good,I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own         sake, but for others' sakes;Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.7 
          It is I, you women—I make my way,I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable—but I love you,I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for         These States—I press with slow rude muscle,I brace myself effectually—I listen to no entreaties,I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long         accumulated within me.8 
          Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,In you I wrap a thousand onward years,On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and         America,The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and ath-         letic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their         turn,I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-         spendings,I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others as I         and you interpenetrate now,I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of         them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing         showers I give now,I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death,         immortality, I plant so lovingly now. SPONTANEOUS ME.SPONTANEOUS me, Nature,The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am         happy with,The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,The hill-side whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain         ash,The same, late in autumn—the hues of red, yellow,         drab, purple, and light and dark green,The rich coverlid of the grass—animals and birds—         the private untrimm'd bank—the primitive ap-         ples—the pebble-stones,Beautiful dripping fragments—the negligent list of one         after another, as I happen to call them to me, or         think of them,The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pic-         tures,)The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like         me,This poem, drooping shy and unseen, that I always         carry, and that all men carry,(Know, once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are         men like me, are our lusty, lurking, masculine         poems;)Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding, love-         climbers, and the climbing sap,Arms and hands of love—lips of love—phallic thumb         of love—breasts of love—bellies press'd and         glued together with love,Earth of chaste love—life that is only life after love,The body of my love—the body of the woman I love—         the body of the man—the body of the earth,Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west,The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and         down—that gripes the full-grown lady-flower,         curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes         his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and         tight till he is satisfied,The wet of woods through the early hours,Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep,         one with an arm slanting down across and below         the waist of the other,The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage-plant,         mint, birch-bark,The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he con-         fides to me what he was dreaming,The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl, and falling still         and content to the ground,The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting         me with,The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it         ever can any one,The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only         privileged feelers may be intimate where they         are,The curious roamer, the hand, roaming all over the         body—the bashful withdrawing of flesh where         the fingers soothingly pause and edge them-         selves,The limpid liquid within the young man,The vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful,The torment—the irritable tide that will not be at rest,The like of the same I feel—the like of the same in         others,The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young         woman that flushes and flushes,The young man that wakes, deep at night, the hot         hand seeking to repress what would master         him;The mystic amorous night—the strange half-welcome         pangs, visions, sweats,The pulse pounding through palms and trembling en-         circling fingers—the young man all color'd, red,         ashamed, angry;The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing         and naked,The merriment of the twin-babes that crawl over the         grass in the sun, the mother never turning her         vigilant eyes from them,The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening         or ripen'd long-round walnuts;The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find         myself indecent, while birds and animals never         once skulk or find themselves indecent;The great chastity of paternity, to match the great         chastity of maternity,The oath of procreation I have sworn—my Adamic and         fresh daughters,The greed that eats me day and night with hungry         gnaw, till I saturate what shall produce boys to         fill my place when I am through,The wholesome relief, repose, content;And this bunch, pluck'd at random from myself;It has done its work—I toss it carelessly to fall where         it may. ONE HOUR TO MADNESS AND JOY.1 
          ONE hour to madness and joy!O furious! O confine me not!(What is this that frees me so in storms?What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds         mean?)2 
          O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other         man;O savage and tender achings!(I bequeath them to you, my children,I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)3 
          O to be yielded to you, whoever you are, and you to         be yielded to me, in defiance of the world!O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!O to draw you to me—to plant on you for the first time         the lips of a determin'd man!4 
          O the puzzle—the thrice-tied knot—the deep and dark         pool! O all untied and illumin'd!O to speed where there is space enough and air enough         at last!O to be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions—I         from mine, and you from yours!O to find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best         of nature?O to have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!O to have the feeling, to-day or any day, I am sufficient         as I am!5 
          O something unprov'd! something in a trance!O madness amorous! O trembling!O to escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dan-         gerous!To court destruction with taunts—with invitations!To ascend—to leap to the heavens of the love indicated         to me!To rise thither with my inebriate Soul!To be lost, if it must be so!To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness         and freedom!With one brief hour of madness and joy. WE TWO—HOW LONG WE WERE FOOL'D.WE two—how long we were fool'd!Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;We are Nature—long have we been absent, but now we         return;We become plants, leaves, foliage, roots, bark;We are bedded in the ground—we are rocks;We are oaks—we grow in the openings side by side;We browse—we are two among the wild herds, spon-         taneous as any;We are two fishes swimming in the sea together;We are what the locust blossoms are—we drop scent         around the lanes, mornings and evenings;We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables,         minerals;We are two predatory hawks—we soar above, and look         down;We are two resplendent suns—we it is who balance         ourselves, orbic and stellar—we are as two         comets;We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods—we         spring on prey;We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving         overhead;We are seas mingling—we are two of those cheerful         waves, rolling over each other, and interwetting         each other;We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive,         pervious, impervious:We are snow, rain, cold, darkness—we are each product         and influence of the globe;We have circled and circled till we have arrived home         again—we two have;We have voided all but freedom, and all but our own         joy. OUT OF THE ROLLING OCEAN, THE CROWD.1OUT of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently         to me,Whispering,  I love you, before long I die,  I have travelled a long way, merely to look on you, to touch           you,  For I could not die till I once look'd on you,  For I fear'd I might afterwards lose you .2(Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe;Return in peace to the ocean, my love;I too am part of that ocean, my love—we are not so         much separated;Behold the great rondure—the cohesion of all, how per-         fect!But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate         us,As for an hour, carrying us diverse—yet cannot carry         us diverse for ever;Be not impatient—a little space—Know you, I salute         the air, the ocean, and the land,Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.) NATIVE MOMENTS.NATIVE moments! when you come upon me—Ah you         are here now!Give me now libidinous joys only!Give me the drench of my passions! Give me life         coarse and rank!To-day, I go consort with nature's darlings—to-night         too;I am for those who believe in loose delights—I share         the midnight orgies of young men;I dance with the dancers, and drink with the drinkers;The echoes ring with our indecent calls;I take for my love some prostitute—I pick out some low         person for my dearest friend,He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate—he shall be one         condemn'd by others for deeds done;I will play a part no longer—Why should I exile myself         from my companions?O you shunn'd persons! I at least do not shun you,I come forthwith in your midst—I will be your poet,I will be more to you than to any of the rest. ONCE I PASS'D THROUGH A POPULOUS CITY.ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my         brain, for future use, with its shows, architec-         ture, customs, and traditions;Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I         casually met there, who detained me for love of         me;Day by day and night by night we were together,—All         else has long been forgotten by me;I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately         clung to me;Again we wander—we love—we separate again;Again she holds me by the hand—I must not go!I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremu-         lous. FACING WEST FROM CALIFORNIA'S SHORES.FACING west, from California's shores,Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of         maternity, the land of migrations, look afar,Look off the shores of my Western Sea—the circle         almost circled;For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales         of Kashmere,From. Asia—from the north—from the God, the sage,         and the hero,From the south—from the flowery peninsulas, and the         spice islands;Long having wander'd since—round the earth having         wander'd,Now I face home again—very pleas'd and joyous;(But where is what I started for, so long ago?And why is it yet unfound?) AGES AND AGES, RETURNING AT INTERVALS.AGES and ages, returning at intervals,Undestroy'd, wandering immortal,Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly         sweet,I, chanter of Adamic songs,Through the new garden, the West, the great cities         calling,Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these,         offering myself,Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex,Offspring of my loins. O HYMEN! O HYMENEE!O HYMEN! O hymenee!Why do you tantalize me thus?O why sting me for a swift moment only?Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?Is it because, if you continued beyond the swift mo-         ment, you would soon certainly kill me? AS ADAM, EARLY IN THE MORNING.As Adam, early in the morning,Walking forth from the bower, refresh'd with sleep?Behold me where I pass—hear my voice—approach,Touch me—touch the palm of your hand to my Body         as I pass;Be not afraid of my Body. 120 TO HIM THAT WAS CRUCIFIED.My spirit to yours, dear brother;Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do         not understand you;I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there         are others also;)I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you,         and to salute those who are with you, before and         since—and those to come also,That we all labor together, transmitting the same         charge and succession;We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of         times;We, enclosers of all continents, all castes—allowers of         all theologies,Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but         reject not the disputers, nor any thing that is         asserted;We hear the bawling and din—we are reached at by         divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every         side,They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my         comrade,Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, jour-         neying up and down, till we make our inefface-         able mark upon time and the diverse eras,Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and wo-         men of races, ages to come, may prove brethren         and lovers, as we are. 120 PERFECTIONS.ONLY themselves understand themselves, and the like of         themselves,As Souls only understand Souls,  CALAMUS. IN PATHS UNTRODDEN.IN paths untrodden,In the growth by margins of pond-waters,Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,From all the standards hitherto publish'd—from the         pleasures, profits, eruditions, conformities,Which too long I was offering to feed my soul;Clear to me, now, standards not yet publish'd—clear to         me that my Soul,That the Soul of the man I speak for, feeds, rejoices         most in comrades;Here, by myself, away from the clank of the world,Tallying and talk'd to here by tongues aromatic,No longer abash'd—for in this secluded spot I can re-         spond as I would not dare elsewhere,Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet         contains all the rest,Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of manly         attachment,Projecting them along that substantial life,Bequeathing, hence, types of athletic love,Afternoon, this delicious Ninth-month, in my forty-first         year,I proceed, for all who are, or have been, young men,To tell the secret of my nights and days,To celebrate the need of comrades. SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST.SCENTED herbage of my breast,Leaves from you I yield, I write, to be perused best         afterwards,Tomb-leaves, body-leaves, growing up above me, above         death,Perennial roots, tall leaves—O the winter shall not         freeze you, delicate leaves,Every year shall you bloom again—Out from where you         retired, you shall emerge again;O I do not know whether many, passing by, will dis-         cover you, or inhale your faint odor—but I be-         lieve a few will;O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit         you to tell, in your own way, of the heart that         is under you;O burning and throbbing—surely all will one day be         accomplish'd;O I do not know what you mean, there underneath         yourselves—you are not happiness,You are often more bitter than I can bear—you burn         and sting me,Yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged         roots—you make me think of Death,Death is beautiful from you—(what indeed is finally         beautiful, except Death and Love?)—O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my         chant of lovers—I think it must be for Death,For how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the         atmosphere of lovers,Death or life, I am then indifferent—my Soul declines         to prefer,I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes         death most;Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean pre-         cisely the same as you mean;Grow up taller, sweet leaves, that I may see! grow up         out of my breast!Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots, timid         leaves!Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my         breast!Come, I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of         mine—I have long enough stifled and choked:—Emblematic and capricious blades, I leave you—now         you serve me not;Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself,I will escape from the sham that was proposed to me,I will sound myself and comrades only—I will never         again utter a call, only their call,I will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through         The States,I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent         shape and will through The States;Through me shall the words be said to make death         exhilarating;Give me your tone therefore, O Death, that I may ac-         cord with it,Give me yourself—for I see that you belong to me now         above all, and are folded inseparably together—         you Love and Death are;Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I         was calling life,For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports         essential,That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons         —and that they are mainly for you,That you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the real         reality,That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait,         no matter how long,That you will one day, perhaps, take control of all,That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of         appearance,That may-be you are what it is all for—but it does not         last so very long;But you will last very long. Whoever you are, Holding me now in Hand.1 
          WHOEVER you are, holding me now in hand,Without one thing, all will be useless;I give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,I am not what you supposed, but far different.2 
          Who is he that would become my follower?Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?3 
          The way is suspicious—the result uncertain, perhaps         destructive;You would have to give up all else—I alone would ex-         pect to be your God, sole and exclusive,Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,The whole past theory of your life, and all conformity         to the lives around you, would have to be aban-         don'd;Therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any         further—Let go your hand from my shoulders,Put me down, and depart on your way.4 
          Or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,Or back of a rock, in the open air,(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not—nor         in company,And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn,         or dead,)But just possibly with you on a high hill—first watch-         ing lest any person, for miles around, approach         unawares,Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of         the sea, or some quiet island,Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or the new hus-         band's kiss,For I am the new husband, and I am the comrade.5 
          Or, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,Where I may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon         your hip,Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;For thus, merely touching you, is enough—is best,And thus, touching you, would I silently sleep and be         carried eternally.6 
          But these leaves conning, you con at peril,For these leaves, and me, you will not understand,They will elude you at first, and still more afterward—l         will certainly elude you,Even while you should think you had unquestionably         caught me, behold!Already you see I have escaped from you.7 
          For it is not for what I have put into it that I have         written this book,Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,Nor do those know me best who admire me, and vaunt-         ingly praise me,Nor will the candidates for my love, (unless at most a         very few,) prove victorious,Nor will my poems do good only—they will do just as         much evil, perhaps more;For all is useless without that which you may guess at         many times and not hit—that which I hinted at;Therefore release me, and depart on your way. THESE I, SINGING IN SPRING.THESE, I, singing in spring, collect for lovers,(For who but I should understand lovers, and all their         sorrow and joy?And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but soon         I pass the gates,Now along the pond-side—now wading in a little, fear-         ing not the wet,Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones         thrown there, pick'd from the fields, have accu-         mulated,(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through         the stones, and partly cover them—Beyond these         I pass,)Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and         then in the silence,Alone I had thought—yet soon a troop gathers around         me,Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some em-         brace my arms or neck,They, the spirits of dear friends, dead or alive—thicker         they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander         with them,Plucking something for tokens—tossing toward whoever         is near me;Here! lilac, with a branch of pine,Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a         live-oak in Florida, as it hung trailing down,Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of         sage,And here what I now draw from the water, wading in         the pond-side,(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and re-         turns again, never to separate from me,And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of com-         rades—this Calamus-root shall,Interchange it, youths, with each other! Let none         render it back!)And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and         chestnut,And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aro-         matic cedar:These, I, compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them         loosely from me,Indicating to each one what he shall have—giving some-         thing to each;But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that         I reserve,I will give of it—but only to them that love, as I my-         self am capable of loving. A SONG.1COME, I will make the continent indissoluble;I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet         shone upon;I will make divine magnetic lands,With the love of comrades,With the life-long love of comrades.2I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the         rivers of America, and along the shores of the         great lakes, and all over the prairies;I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about         each other's necks;By the love of comrades,By the manly love of comrades.3For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you,         ma femme!For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,In the love of comrades,In the high-towering love of comrades. NOT HEAVING FROM MY RIBB'D BREAST ONLY.NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only;Not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs;Not in many an oath and promise broken;Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition;Not in the subtle nourishment of the air;Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and         wrists;Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which         will one day cease;Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when         alone, far in the wilds;Not in husky pantings through clench'd teeth;Not in sounded and resounded words—chattering words,         echoes, dead words;Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of         every day;Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you         and dismiss you continually—Not there;Not in any or all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of         my life!Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than         in these songs. OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.OF the terrible doubt of appearances,Of the uncertainty after all—that we may be deluded,That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations         after all,That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful         fable only,May-be the things I perceive—the animals, plants, men,         hills, shining and flowing waters,The skies of day and night—colors, densities, forms—         May-be these are, (as doubtless they are,) only         apparitions, and the real something has yet to be         known;(How often they dart out of themselves, as if to con-         found me and mock me!How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows,         aught of them;)May-be seeming to me what they are, (as doubtless they         indeed but seem,) as from my present point of         view—And might prove, (as of course they         would,) naught of what they appear, or naught         any how, from entirely changed points of view;—To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously an-         swer'd by my lovers, my dear friends;When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long         while holding me by the hand,When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that         words and reason hold not, surround us and         pervade us,Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom         —I am silent—I require nothing further,I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that         of identity beyond the grave;But I walk or sit indifferent—I am satisfied,He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me. The Base of all Metaphysics.1 
          AND now, gentlemen,A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,As base, and finale too, for all metaphysics.2 
          (So, to the students, the old professor,At the close of his crowded course.)3 
          Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and         Germanic systems,Kant having studied and stated—Fichte and Schelling         and Hegel,Stated the lore of Plato—and Socrates, greater than         Plato,And greater than Socrates sought and stated—Christ         divine having studied long,I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic         systems,See the philosophies all—Christian churches and tenets         see,Yet underneath Socrates clearly see—and underneath         Christ the divine I see,The dear love of man for his comrade—the attraction         of friend to friend,Of the well-married husband and wife—of children and         parents,Of city for city, and land for land. RECORDERS AGES HENCE.RECORDERS ages hence!Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive         exterior—I will tell you what to say of me;Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of         the tenderest lover,The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his         lover, was fondest,Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measure-         less ocean of love within him—and freely pour'd         it forth,Who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his dear         friends, his lovers,Who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleep-         less and dissatisfied at night,Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he         lov'd might secretly be indifferent to him,Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in         woods, on hills, he and another, wandering hand         in hand, they twain, apart from other men,Who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curv'd with his         arm the shoulder of his friend—while the arm         of his friend rested upon him also. WHEN I HEARD AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY.WHEN I heard at the close of the day how my name         had been receiv'd with plaudits in the capitol,         still it was not a happy night for me that fol-         low'd;And else, when I carous'd, or when my plans were         accomplish'd, still I was not happy;But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of per-         fect health, refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe         breath of autumn,When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and         disappear in the morning light,When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undress-         ing, bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and         saw the sun rise,And when I thought how my dear friend, my lover, was         on his way coming, O then I was happy;O then each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day my         food nourish'd me more—and the beautiful day         pass'd well,And the next came with equal joy—and with the next,         at evening, came my friend;And that night, while all was still, I heard the waters         roll slowly continually up the shores,I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as         directed to me, whispering, to congratulate me,For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the         same cover in the cool night,In the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was         inclined toward me,And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that         night I was happy. Are You the New Person drawn toward Me?ARE you the new person drawn toward me?To begin with, take warning—I am surely far different         from what you suppose;Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd         satisfaction?Do you think I am trusty and faithful?Do you see no further than this facade—this smooth         and tolerant manner of me?Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground to-         ward a real heroic man?Have you no thought, O dreamer, that it may be all         maya, illusion? Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone.ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods,         and from the pond-side,Breast-sorrel and pinks of love—fingers that wind         around tighter than vines,Gushes from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of         trees, as the sum is risen;Breezes of land and love—breezes set from living         shores out to you on the living sea—to you, O         sailors!Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd         fresh to young persons wandering out in the         fields when the winter breaks up,Love-buds, put before you and within you, whoever you         are,Buds to be unfolded on the old terms;If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will         open, and bring form, color, perfume, to you;If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become         flowers, fruits, tall branches, and trees. Not Heat Flames up and Consumes.NOT heat flames up and consumes,Not sea-waves hurry in and out,Not the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe sum-         mer, bears lightly along white down-balls of         myriads of seeds,Wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;Not these—O none of these, more than the flames of         me, consuming, burning for his love whom I love!O none, more than I, hurrying in and out;—Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never         give up? O I the same;O nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high, rain-         emitting clouds, are borne through the open air,Any more than my Soul is borne through the open         air,Wafted in all directions, O love, for friendship, for         you. Trickle, Drops.TRICKLE, drops! my blue veins leaving!O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,Candid, from me falling—drip, bleeding drops,From wounds made to free you whence you were         prison'd,From my face—from my forehead and lips,From my breast—from within where I was conceal'd—         press forth, red drops—confession drops;Stain every page—stain every song I sing, every word         I say, bloody drops;Let them know your scarlet heat—let them glisten;Saturate them with yourself, all ashamed and wet;Glow upon all I have written, or shall write, bleeding         drops;Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops. City of Orgies.CITY of orgies, walks and joys!City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst         will one day make you illustrious,Not the pageants of you—not your shifting tableaux,         your spectacles, repay me;Not the interminable rows of your houses—nor the         ships at the wharves,Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright win-         dows, with goods in them;Nor to converse with learn'd persons, or bear my share         in the soiree or feast;Not those—but, as I pass, O Manhattan! your frequent         and swift flash of eyes offering me love,Offering response to my own—these repay me;Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me. Behold this Swarthy Face.BEHOLD this swarthy face—these gray eyes,This beard—the white wool, unclipt upon my neck,My brown hands, and the silent manner of me, without         charm;Yet comes one, a Manhattanese, and ever at parting,         kisses me lightly on the lips with robust love,And I, on the crossing of the street, or on the ship's         deck, give a kiss in return;We observe that salute of American comrades, land and         sea,We are those two natural and nonchalant persons. I saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing.I SAW in Louisiana a live-oak growing,All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the         branches;Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous         leaves of dark green,And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of         myself;But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, stand-         ing alone there, without its friend, its lover near         —for I knew I could not;And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves         upon it, and twined around it a little moss,And brought it away—and I have placed it in sight in         my room;It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them;)Yet it remains to me a curious token—it makes me         think of manly love;For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in         Louisiana, solitary, in a wide flat space,Uttering, joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a         lover, near,I know very well I could not. TO A STRANGER.PASSING stranger! you do not know how longingly I         look upon you,You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it         comes to me, as of a dream,)I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate,         chaste, matured,You grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl         with me,I ate with you, and slept with you—your body has be-         come not yours only, nor left my body mine only,You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as         we pass—you take of my beard, breast, hands,         in return,I am not to speak to you—I am to think of you when I         sit alone, or wake at night alone,I am to wait—I do not doubt I am to meet you again,I am to see to it that I do not lose you. This Moment, Yearning and Thoughtful.THIS moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,It seems to me there are other men in other lands,         yearning and thoughtful;It seems to me I can look over and behold them, in         Germany, Italy, France, Spain—or far, far away,         in China, or in Russia or India—talking other         dialects;And it seems to me if I could know those men, I should         become attached to them, as I do to men in my         own lands;O I know we should be brethren and lovers,I know I should be happy with them. I Hear it was Charged Against Me.I HEAR it was charged against me that I sought to de-         stroy institutions;But really I am neither for nor against institutions;(What indeed have I in common with them?—Or what         with the destruction of them?)Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and in every         city of These States, inland and seaboard,And in the fields and woods, and above every keel,         little or large, that dents the water,Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any argu-         ment,The institution of the dear love of comrades. The Prairie-Grass Dividing.THE prairie-grass dividing—its special odor breathing,I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,Demand the most copious and close companionship of         men,Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh,         nutritious,Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with free-         dom and command—leading, not following,Those with a never-quell'd audacity—those with sweet         and lusty flesh, clear of taint,Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents         and Governors, as to say,  Who are you? Those of earth-born passion, simple, never-constrain'd,         never obedient,Those of inland America. We Two Boys Together Clinging.WE two boys together clinging,One the other never leaving,Up and down the roads going—North and South excur-         sions making,Power enjoying—elbows stretching—fingers clutching,Arm'd and fearless—eating, drinking, sleeping, loving,No law less than ourselves owning—sailing, soldiering,         thieving, threatening,Misers, menials, priests alarming—air breathing, water         drinking, on the turf or the sea-beach dancing,Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, fee-         bleness chasing,Fulfilling our foray. A PROMISE TO CALIFORNIA.A PROMISE to California,Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward         you, to remain, to teach robust American love;For I know very well that I and robust love belong         among you, inland, and along the Western Sea;For These States tend inland, and toward the Western         Sea—and I will also. HERE THE FRAILEST LEAVES OF ME.HERE the frailest leaves of me, and yet my strongest-         lasting:Here I shade and hide my thoughts—I myself do not         expose them,And yet they expose me more than all my other poems. When I Peruse the Conquer'd Fame.WHEN I peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes, and the         victories of mighty generals, I do not envy the         generals,Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his         great house;But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it         was with them,How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging,         long and long,Through youth, and through middle and old age, how         unfaltering, how affectionate and faithful they         were,Then I am pensive—I hastily walk away, fill'd with the         bitterest envy. WHAT THINK YOU I TAKE MY PEN IN HAND?WHAT think you I take my pen in hand to record?The battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw         pass the offing to-day under full sail?The splendors of the past day? Or the splendor of the         night that envelops me?Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city         spread around me?—No;But I record of two simple men I saw to-day, on the         pier, in the midst of the crowd, parting the part-         ing of dear friends;The one to remain hung on the other's neck, and pas-         sionately kiss'd him,While the one to depart, tightly prest the one to remain         in his arms. A GLIMPSE.A GLIMPSE, through an interstice caught,Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room,         around the stove, late of a winter night—And I         unremark'd, seated in a corner;Of a youth who loves me, and whom I love, silently ap-         proaching, and seating himself near, that he may         hold me by the hand;A long while, amid the noises of coming and going—of         drinking and oath and smutty jest,There we two, content, happy in being together, speak-         ing little, perhaps not a word. NO LABOR-SAVING MACHINE.No labor-saving machine,Nor discovery have I made;Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy be-         quest to found a hospital or library,Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage, for America,Nor literary success, nor intellect—nor book for the         book-shelf;Only a few carols, vibrating through the air, I leave,For comrades and lovers. A LEAF FOR HAND IN HAND.A LEAF for hand in hand!You natural persons old and young!You on the Mississippi, and on all the branches and         bayous of the Mississippi!You friendly boatmen and mechanics! You roughs!You twain! And all processions moving along the         streets!I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it com-         mon for you to walk hand in hand! TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST.To the East and to the West;To the man of the Seaside State, and of Pennsylvania,To the Kanadian of the North—to the Southerner I         love;These, with perfect trust, to depict you as myself—the         germs are in all men;I believe the main purport of These States is to found         a superb friendship, exalt, previously unknown,Because I perceive it waits, and has been always wait-         ing, latent in all men. EARTH! MY LIKENESS!EARTH! my likeness!Though you look so impassive, ample spheric         there,I now suspect that is not all;I now suspect there is something fierce in you, eligible         to burst forth;For an athlete is enamour'd of me—and I of him;But toward him there is something fierce and terrible         in me, eligible to burst forth,I dare not tell it in words—not even in these songs. I DREAM'D IN A DREAM.I DREAM'D in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the         attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth;I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust         love—it led the rest;It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of         that city,And in all their looks and words. FAST ANCHOR'D, ETERNAL, O LOVE!FAST-ANCHOR'D, eternal, O love! O woman I love!O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the         thought of you!—Then separate, as disembodied, or another born,Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation;I ascend—I float in the regions of your love, O man,O sharer of my roving life. Sometimes with One I Love.SOMETIMES with one I love, I fill myself with rage, for         fear I effuse unreturn'd love;But now I think there is no unreturn'd love—the pay         is certain, one way or another;(I loved a certain person ardently, and my love was         not return'd;Yet out of that, I have written these songs.) That Shadow, my Likeness.THAT shadow, my likeness, that goes to and fro, seek-         ing a livelihood, chattering, chaffering;How often I find myself standing and looking at it         where it flits;How often I question and doubt whether that is really         me;—But in these, and among my lovers, and caroling my         songs,O I never doubt whether that is really me. AMONG THE MULTITUDE.1 
          AMONG the men and women, the multitude,I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine         signs,Acknowledging none else—not parent, wife, husband,         brother, child, any nearer than I am;Some are baffled—But that one is not—that one knows         me.2 
          Ah, lover and perfect equal!I meant that you should discover me so, by my faint         indirections;And I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the         like in you. TO A WESTERN BOY.O BOY of the West!To you many things to absorb, I teach, to help you         become eleve of mine:Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins;If you be not silently selected by lovers, and do not         silently select lovers,Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine? O YOU WHOM I OFTEN AND SILENTLY COME.O YOU whom I often and silently come where you are,         that I may be with you;As I walk by your side, or sit near, or remain in the         same room with you,Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your         sake is playing within me.  SALUT AU MONDE!11 
          O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next!Each answering all—each sharing the earth with all.2 
          What widens within you, Walt Whitman?What waves and soils exuding?What climes? what persons and lands are here?Who are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?Who are the girls? who are the married women?Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their         arms about each other's necks?What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are         these?What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the         mists?What myriads of dwellings are they, fill'd with dwellers?23 
          Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east—America is pro-         vided for in the west;Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends;Within me is the longest day—the sun wheels in slant-         ing rings—it does not set for months;Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just         rises above the horizon, and sinks again;Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes,         groups,Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.34 
          What do you hear, Walt Whitman?5 
          I hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife         singing;I hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of         animals early in the day;I hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Ten-         nessee and Kentucky, hunting on hills;I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the wild         horse;I hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, in the chestnut         shade, to the rebeck and guitar;I hear continual echoes from the Thames;I hear fierce French liberty songs;I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative         of old poems;I hear the Virginia plantation-chorus of negroes, of a         harvest night, in the glare of pine-knots;I hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men of         Mannahatta;I hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, and singing;I hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary north-         west lakes;I hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as they strike         the grain and grass with the showers of their         terrible clouds;I hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, pensively         falling on the breast of the black venerable vast         mother, the Nile;I hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams of         Kanada;I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the         bells of the mule;I hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the         mosque;I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their         churches—I hear the responsive base and         soprano;I hear the wail of utter despair of the white-hair'd         Irish grand-parents, when they learn the death         of their grandson;I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice,         putting to sea at Okotsk;I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves         march on—as the husky gangs pass on by twos         and threes, fasten'd together with wrist-chains         and ankle-chains;I hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment         —I hear the sibilant whisk of thongs through         the air;I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the         strong legends of the Romans;I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of         the beautiful God—the Christ;I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the         loves, wars, adages, transmitted safely to this         day, from poets who wrote three thousand years         ago.46 
          What do you see, Walt Whitman?Who are they you salute, and that one after another         salute you?7 
          I see a great round wonder rolling through the air;I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails,         factories, palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians,         tents of nomads, upon the surface;I see the shaded part on one side, where the sleepers         are sleeping—and the sun-lit part on the other         side,I see the curious silent change of the light and shade,I see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants         of them, as my land is to me.8 
          I see plenteous waters;I see mountain peaks—I see the sierras of Andes and         Alleghanies, where they range;I see plainly the Himalayas, Chian Shahs, Altays,         Ghauts;I see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, Kazbek, Bazardjusi,I see the Rocky Mountains, and the Peak of Winds;I see the Styrian Alps, and the Karnac Alps;I see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians—and to the         north the Dofrafields, and off at sea Mount         Hecla;I see Vesuvius and Etna—I see the Anahuacs;I see the Mountains of the Moon, and the Snow         Mountains, and the Red Mountains of Mada-         gascar;I see the Vermont hills, and the long string of Cor-         dilleras;I see the vast deserts of Western America;I see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic deserts;I see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs;I see the superior oceans and the inferior ones—the         Atlantic and Pacific, the sea of Mexico, the         Brazilian sea, and the sea of Peru,The Japan waters, those of Hindostan, the China Sea,         and the Gulf of Guinea,The spread of the Baltic, Caspian, Bothnia, the British         shores, and the Bay of Biscay,The clear-sunn'd Mediterranean, and from one to an-         other of its islands,The inland fresh-tasted seas of North America,The White Sea, and the sea around Greenland.9 
          I behold the mariners of the world;Some are in storms—some in the night, with the         watch on the look-out;Some drifting helplessly—some with contagious dis-         eases.10 
          I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some         in clusters in port, some on their voyages;Some double the Cape of Storms—some Cape Verde,         —others Cape Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore;Others Dondra Head—others pass the Straits of Sun-         da—others Cape Lopatka—others Behring's         Straits;Others Cape Horn—others sail the gulf of Mexico, or         along Cuba or Hayti—others Hudson's Bay or         Baffin's Bay;Others pass the Straits of Dover—others enter the         Wash—others the Firth of Solway—others         round Cape Clear—others the Land's End;Others traverse the Zuyder Zee, or the Scheld;Others add to the exits and entrances at Sandy Hook;Others to the comers and goers at Gibraltar, or the         Dardanelles;Others sternly push their way through the northern         winter-packs;Others descend or ascend the Obi or the Lena;Others the Niger or the Congo—others the Indus, the         Burampooter and Cambodia;Others wait at the wharves of Manhattan, steam'd up,         ready to start;Wait, swift and swarthy, in the ports of Australia;Wait at Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lis-         bon, Naples, Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, the         Hague, Copenhagen;Wait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama;Wait at their moorings at Boston, Philadelphia, Balti-         more, Charleston, New Orleans, Galveston, San         Francisco.511 
          I see the tracks of the rail-roads of the earth;I see them welding State to State, city to city, through         North America;I see them in Great Britain, I see them in Europe;I see them in Asia and in Africa.12 
          I see the electric telegraphs of the earth;I see the filaments of the news of the wars, deaths,         losses, gains, passions, of my race.13 
          I see the long river-stripes of the earth;I see where the Mississippi flows—I see where the Co-         lumbia flows;I see the Great River, and the Falls of Niagara;I see the Amazon and the Paraguay;I see the four great rivers of China, the Amour, the         Yellow River, the Yiang-tse, and the Pearl;I see where the Seine flows, and where the Danube,         the Loire, the Rhone, and the Guadalquiver         flow;I see the windings of the Volga, the Dnieper, the         Oder;I see the Tuscan going down the Arno, and the Vene-         tian along the Po;I see the Greek seaman sailing out of Egina bay.614 
          I see the site of the old empire of Assyria, and that         of Persia, and that of India;I see the falling of the Ganges over the high rim of         Saukara.15 
          I see the place of the idea of the Deity incarnated by         avatars in human forms;I see the spots of the successions of priests on the earth         —oracles, sacrificers, brahmins, sabians, lamas,         monks, muftis, exhorters;I see where druids walked the groves of Mona—I see         the mistletoe and vervain;I see the temples of the deaths of the bodies of Gods—         I see the old signifiers.16 
          I see Christ once more eating the bread of his last         supper, in the midst of youths and old persons;I see where the strong divine young man, the Hercules,         toil'd faithfully and long, and then died;I see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate         of the beautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd         Bacchus;I see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown         of feathers on his head;I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying         to the people,  Do not weep for me,  This is not my true country, I have lived banish'd from           my true country—I now go back there,  I return to the celestial sphere, where every one goes in his           turn .717 
          I see the battle-fields of the earth—grass grows upon         them, and blossoms and corn;I see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.18 
          I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of         the unknown events, heroes, records of the earth.19 
          I see the places of the sagas;I see pine-trees and fir-trees torn by northern blasts;I see granite boulders and cliffs—I see green meadows         and lakes;I see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian warriors;I see them raised high with stones, by the marge of         restless oceans, that the dead men's spirits, when         they wearied of their quiet graves, might rise up         through the mounds, and gaze on the tossing bil-         lows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity, lib-         erty, action.20 
          I see the steppes of Asia;I see the tumuli of Mongolia—I see the tents of Kal-         mucks and Baskirs;I see the nomadic tribes, with herds of oxen and cows;I see the table-lands notch'd with ravines—I see the         jungles and deserts;I see the camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fat-         tail'd sheep, the antelope, and the burrowing         wolf.21 
          I see the high-lands of Abyssinia;I see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, tama-         rind, date,And see fields of teff-wheat, and see the places of ver-         dure and gold.22 
          I see the Brazilian vaquero;I see the Bolivian ascending Mount Sorata;I see the Wacho crossing the plains—I see the incom-         parable rider of horses with his lasso on his         arm;I see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for         their hides.823 
          I see little and large sea-dots, some inhabited, some         uninhabited;I see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of Pau-         manok, quite still;I see ten fishermen waiting—they discover now a thick         school of moss-bonkers—they drop the join'd         seine-ends in the water,The boats separate—they diverge and row off, each on         its rounding course to the beach, enclosing the         mossbonkers;The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop         ashore,Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats—others         stand negligently ankle-deep in the water, pois'd         on strong legs;The boats are partly drawn up—the water slaps against         them;On the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from the         water, lie the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.924 
          I see the despondent red man in the west, lingering         about the banks of Moingo, and about Lake         Pepin;He has heard the quail and beheld the honey-bee, and         sadly prepared to depart.25 
          I see the regions of snow and ice;I see the sharp-eyed Samoiede and the Finn;I see the seal-seeker in his boat, poising his lance;I see the Siberian on his slight-built sledge, drawn by         dogs;I see the porpoise-hunters—I see the whale-crews of         the South Pacific and the North Atlantic;I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switzerland         —I mark the long winters, and the isolation.26 
          I see the cities of the earth, and make myself at ran-         dom a part of them;I am a real Parisian;I am a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Con-         stantinople;I am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne;I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Lim-         erick;I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brus-         sels, Berne, Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence;I belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw—or northward         in Christiania or Stockholm—or in Siberian         Irkutsk—or in some street in Iceland;I descend upon all those cities, and rise from them         again.1027 
          I see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries;I see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd         splint, the fetish, and the obi.28 
          I see African and Asiatic towns;I see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo,         Monrovia;I see the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi,         Calcutta, Yedo;I see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and         Ashantee-man in their huts;I see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo;I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva, and         those of Herat;I see Teheran—I see Muscat and Medina, and the inter-         vening sands—I see the caravans toiling onward;I see Egypt and the Egyptians—I see the pyramids and         obelisks;I look on chisel'd histories, songs, philosophies, cut in         slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks;I see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies,         embalm'd, swathed in linen cloth, lying there         many centuries;I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the         side-drooping neck, the hands folded across the         breast.29 
          I see the menials of the earth, laboring;I see the prisoners in the prisons;I see the defective human bodies of the earth;I see the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks,         lunatics;I see the pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-         makers of the earth;I see the helpless infants, and the helpless old men and         women.30 
          I see male and female everywhere;I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs;I see the constructiveness of my race;I see the results of the perseverance and industry of         my race;I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations—I go         among them—I mix indiscriminately,And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.1131

Good will to you all—from me and         America sent.32 
          Each of us inevitable;Each of us limitless—each of us with his or her right         upon the earth;Each of us allow'd the eternal purports of the earth;Each of us here as divinely as any is here.1233

always the conti-         nent of Democracy!Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, trav-         elers, Kanada, the snows;Always these compact lands—lands tied at the hips         with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes;Always the West, with strong native persons—the in-         creasing density there—the habitans, friendly,         threatening, ironical, scorning invaders;All sights, South, North, East—all deeds, promiscu-         ously done at all times,All characters, movements, growths—a few noticed,         myriads unnoticed,Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things         gathering;On interior rivers, by night, in the glare of pine knots,         steamboats wooding up;Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and         on the valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock,         and the valleys of the Roanoke and Delaware;In their northerly wilds, beasts of prey haunting the         Adirondacks, the hills—or lapping the Saginaw         waters to drink;In a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, lost from the flock,         sitting on the water, rocking silently;In farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest labor         done—they rest standing—they are too tired;Afar on arctic ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily, while         her cubs play around;The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd—the         farthest polar sea, ripply, crystalline, open, be-         yond the floes;White drift spooning ahead, where the ship in the tem-         pest dashes;On solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells all         strike midnight together;In primitive woods, the sounds there also sounding—         the howl of the wolf, the scream of the panther,         and the hoarse bellow of the elk;In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake         —in summer visible through the clear waters,         the great trout swimming;In lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the         large black buzzard floating slowly, high beyond         the tree tops,Below, the red cedar, festoon'd with tylandria—the         pines and cypresses, growing out of the white         sand that spreads far and flat;Rude boats descending the big Pedee—climbing plants,         parasites, with color'd flowers and berries, envel-         oping huge trees,The waving drapery on the live oak, trailing long and         low, noiselessly waved by the wind;The camp of Georgia wagoners, just after dark—the         supper-fires, and the cooking and eating by         whites and negroes,Thirty or forty great wagons—the mules, cattle, horses,         feeding from troughs,The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old         sycamore-trees—the flames—with the black smoke         from the pitch-pine, curling and rising;Southern fishermen fishing—the sounds and inlets of         North Carolina's coast—the shad-fishery and the         herring-fishery—the large sweep-seines—the         windlasses on shore work'd by horses—the clear-         ing, curing, and packing-houses;Deep in the forest, in piney woods, turpentine dropping         from the incisions in the trees—There are the         turpentine works,There are the negroes at work, in good health—the         ground in all directions is cover'd with pine         straw:—In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves busy in the coal-         ings, at the forge, by the furnace-blaze, or at the         corn-shucking;In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long         absence, joyfully welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged         mulatto nurse;On rivers, boatmen safely moor'd at nightfall, in their         boats, under shelter of high banks,Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the         banjo or fiddle—others sit on the gunwale, smok-         ing and talking;Late in the afternoon, the mocking-bird, the American         mimic, singing in the Great Dismal Swamp—         there are the greenish waters, the resinous odor,         the plenteous moss, the cypress tree, and the         juniper tree;—Northward, young men of Mannahatta—the target         company from an excursion returning home at         evening—the musket-muzzles all bear bunches         of flowers presented by women;Children at play—or on his father's lap a young boy         fallen asleep, (how his lips move! how he smiles         in his sleep!)The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of         the Mississippi—he ascends a knoll and sweeps         his eye around;California life—the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude         costume—the stanch California friendship—the         sweet air—the graves one, in passing, meets,         solitary, just aside the horse-path;Down in Texas, the cotton-field, the negro-cabins—         drivers driving mules or oxen before rude carts—         cotton bales piled on banks and wharves;Encircling all, vast-darting, up and wide, the American         Soul, with equal hemispheres—one Love, one         Dilation or Pride;—In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, the abo-         rigines—the calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbi-         tration, and indorsement,The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and         then toward the earth,The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted         faces and guttural exclamations,The setting out of the war-party—the long and stealthy         march,The single-file—the swinging hatchets—the surprise         and slaughter of enemies;—All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of These         States—reminiscences, all institutions,All These States, compact—Every square mile of These         States, without excepting a particle—you also—         me also,Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Pau-         manok's fields,Me, observing the spiral flight of two little yellow but-         terflies, shuffling between each other, ascending         high in the air;The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects—the fall         traveler southward, but returning northward         early in the spring;The country boy at the close of the day, driving the         herd of cows, and shouting to them as they loiter         to browse by the road-side;The city wharf—Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore,         Charleston, New Orleans, San Francisco,The departing ships, when the sailors heave at the         capstan;—Evening—me in my room—the setting sun,The setting summer sun shining in my open window,         showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing         in the air in the centre of the room, darting         athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows in         specks on the opposite wall, where the shine is;The athletic American matron speaking in public to         crowds of listeners;Males, females, immigrants, combinations—the copious-          ness—the individuality of The States, each for         itself—the money-makers;Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces—the wind-          lass, lever, pulley—All certainties,The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,In space, the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars—         on the firm earth, the lands, my lands;O lands! all so dear to me—what you are, (whatever it         is,) I become a part of that, whatever it is;Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping,         with the myriads of gulls wintering along the         coasts of Florida—or in Louisiana, with pelicans         breeding;Otherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the         Rio Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombig-          bee, the Red River, the Saskatchawan, or the         Osage, I with the spring waters laughing and         skipping and running;Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Pau-          manok, I, with parties of snowy herons wading         in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants;Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from         piercing the crow with its bill, for amusement—         And I triumphantly twittering;  SONG OF THE OPEN ROAD.11 
          AFOOT and light-hearted, I take to the open road,Healthy, free, the world before me,The long brown path before me, leading wherever I         choose.2 
          Henceforth I ask not good-fortune—I myself am good-          fortune;Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more,         need nothing,Strong and content, I travel the open road.3 
          The earth—that is sufficient;I do not want the constellations any nearer;I know they are very well where they are;I know they suffice for those who belong to them.4 
          (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens;I carry them, men and women—I carry them with me         wherever I go;I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them;I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)25 
          You road I enter upon and look around! I believe         you are not all that is here;I believe that much unseen is also here.6 
          Here the profound lesson of reception, neither prefer-          ence or denial;The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd,         the illiterate person, are not denied;The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's         tramp, the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party         of mechanics,The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop,         the eloping couple,The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of fur-          niture into the town, the return back from the         town,They pass—I also pass—anything passes—none can be         interdicted;None but are accepted—none but are dear to me:37 
          You air that serves me with breath to speak!You objects that call from diffusion my meanings, and         give them shape!You light that wraps me and all things in delicate         equable showers!You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the road-          sides!I think you are latent with unseen existences—you are         so dear to me.8 
          You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at         the edges!You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you         timber-lined sides! you distant ships!You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd facades! you         roofs!You porches and entrances! you copings and iron         guards!You windows whose transparent shells might expose so         much!You doors and ascending steps! you arches!You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trod-          den crossings!From all that has been near you, I believe you have im-          parted to yourselves, and now would impart the         same secretly to me;From the living and the dead I think you have peopled         your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof         would be evident and amicable with me.49 
          The earth expanding right hand and left hand,The picture alive, every part in its best light,The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping         where it is not wanted,The cheerful voice of the public road—the gay fresh         sentiment of the road.10 
          O highway I travel! O public road! do you say to         me,  Do not leave me? Do you say,  Venture not? If you leave me, you are lost? Do you say,  I am already prepared—I am well-beaten and           undenied—adhere to me? 11 
          O public road! I say back, I am not afraid to leave         you—yet I love you;You express me better than I can express myself;You shall be more to me than my poem.12 
          I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open         air, and all great poems also;I think I could stop here myself, and do miracles;(My judgments, thoughts, I henceforth try by the open         air, the road:)I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like,         and whoever beholds me shall like me;I think whoever I see must be happy.513 
          From this hour, freedom!From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and         imaginary lines,Going where I list, my own master, total and absolute,Listening to others, and considering well what they say,Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of         the holds that would hold me.14 
          I inhale great draughts of space;The east and the west are mine, and the north and the         south are mine.15 
          I am larger, better than I thought,I did not know I held so much goodness.16 
          All seems beautiful to me;I can repeat over to men and women, You have done         such good to me, I would do the same to you.17 
          I will recruit for myself and you as I go;I will scatter myself among men and women as I go;I will toss the new gladness and roughness among         them;Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me;Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and         shall bless me.618 
          Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, it         would not amaze me;Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd,         it would not astonish me.19 
          Now I see the secret of the making of the best per-         sons,It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and sleep with         the earth.20 
          Here a great personal deed has room;A great deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race         of men,Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law, and         mocks all authority and all argument against it.21 
          Here is the test of wisdom;Wisdom is not finally tested in schools;Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it, to an-          other not having it;Wisdom is of the Soul, is not susceptible of proof, is         its own proof,Applies to all stages and objects and qualities, and is         content,Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things,         and the excellence of things;Something there is in the float of the sight of things.         that provokes it out of the Soul.22 
          Now I rexamine philosophies and religions,They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at         all under the spacious clouds, and along the         landscape and flowing currents.23 
          Here is realization;Here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in         him;The past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of         you, you are vacant of them.24 
          Only the kernel of every object nourishes;Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for         you and me?25 
          Here is adhesiveness—it is not previously fashion'd—         it is apropos;Do you know what it is, as you pass, to be loved by         strangers?Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?726 
          Here is the efflux of the Soul;The efflux of the Soul comes from within, through em-          bower'd gates, ever provoking questions:These yearnings, why are they? These thoughts in the         darkness, why are they?Why are there men and women that while they are         nigh me, the sun-light expands my blood!Why, when they leave me, do my pennants of joy sink         flat and lank?Why are there trees I never walk under, but large and         melodious thoughts descend upon me?(I think they hang there winter and summer on those         trees, and always drop fruit as I pass;)What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?What with some driver, as I ride on the seat by his         side?What with some fisherman, drawing his seine by the         shore, as I walk by, and pause?What gives me to be free to a woman's or man's good-          will? What gives them to be free to mine?827 
          The efflux of the Soul is happiness—here is happi-          ness;I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times;Now it flows unto us—we are rightly charged.28 
          Here rises the fluid and attaching character;The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and         sweetness of man and woman;(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter         every day out of the roots of themselves, than it         sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)29 
          Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the         sweat of the love of young and old;From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and         attainments;Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.930 
          Allons! whoever you are, come travel with me!Traveling with me, you find what never tires.31 
          The earth never tires;The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first—         Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first;Be not discouraged—keep on—there are divine things,         well envelop'd;I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful         than words can tell.32 
          Allons! we must not stop here!However sweet these laid-up stores—however conve-          nient this dwelling, we cannot remain here;However shelter'd this port, and however calm these         waters, we must not anchor here;However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we         are permitted to receive it but a little while.1033 
          Allons! the inducements shall be greater;We will sail pathless and wild seas;We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the         Yankee clipper speeds by under full sail.34 
          Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements!Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;Allons! from all formules!From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic         priests!35 
          The stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial         waits no longer.36 
          Allons! yet take warning!He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, en-          durance;None may come to the trial, till he or she bring courage         and health.37 
          Come not here if you have already spent the best of         yourself;Only those may come, who come in sweet and deter-          min'd bodies;No diseas'd person—no rum-drinker or venereal taint         is permitted here.38 
          I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes,         rhymes;We convince by our presence.1139 
          Listen! I will be honest with you;I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough         new prizes;These are the days that must happen to you:40 
          You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or         achieve,You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd—         you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction, before         you are call'd by an irresistible call to depart,You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mock-          ings of those who remain behind you;What beckonings of love you receive, you shall only         answer with passionate kisses of parting,You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their         reach'd hands towards you.1241 
          Allons! after the GREAT COMPANIONS! and to belong         to them!They too are on the road! they are the swift and ma-          jestic men! they are the greatest women.42 
          Over that which hinder'd them—over that which re-          tarded—passing impediments large or small,Committers of crimes, committers of many beautiful         virtues,Enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of seas,Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,Habitus of many distant countries, habitus of far-          distant dwellings,Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary         toilers,Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of         the shore,Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender         helpers of children, bearers of children,Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers         down of coffins,Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years—         the curious years, each emerging from that which         preceded it,Journeyers as with companions, namely, their own         diverse phases,Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,Journeyers gayly with their own youth—Journeyers         with their bearded and well-grain'd manhood,Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd,         content,Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood         or womanhood,Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty         breadth of the universe,Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom         of death.1343 
          Allons! to that which is endless, as it was begin-          ningless,To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and         nights they tend to,Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys;To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it         and pass it,To conceive no time, however distant, but what you         may reach it and pass it,To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits         for you—however long, but it stretches and waits         for you;To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go         thither,To see no possession but you may possess it—enjoying         all without labor or purchase—abstracting the         feast, yet not abstracting one particle of it;To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's         elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-          married couple, and the fruits of orchards and         flowers of gardens,To take to your use out of the compact cities as you         pass through,To carry buildings and streets with you afterward         wherever you go,To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you         encounter them—to gather the love out of their         hearts,To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that         you leave them behind you,To know the universe itself as a road—as many roads—         as roads for traveling souls.1444 
          The Soul travels;The body does not travel as much as the soul;The body has just as great a work as the soul, and parts         away at last for the journeys of the soul.45 
          All parts away for the progress of souls;All religion, all solid things, arts, governments,—all         that was or is apparent upon this globe or any         globe, falls into niches and corners before the         procession of Souls along the grand roads of the         universe.46 
          Of the progress of the souls of men and women along         the grand roads of the universe, all other progress         is the needed emblem and sustenance.47 
          Forever alive, forever forward,Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent,         feeble, dissatisfied,Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected         by men,They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know         not where they go;But I know that they go toward the best—toward some-          thing great.1548 
          Allons! whoever you are! come forth!You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the         house, though you built it, or though it has been         built for you.49 
          Allons! out of the dark confinement!It is useless to protest—I know all, and expose it.50 
          Behold, through you as bad as the rest,Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of         people,Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd         and trimm'd faces,Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.51 
          No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the         confession;Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and         hiding it goes,Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities,         polite and bland in the parlors,In the cars of rail-roads, in steamboats, in the public         assembly,Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in         the bed-room, everywhere,Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright,         death under the breast-bones, hell under the         skull-bones,Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons         and artificial flowers,Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable         of itself,Speaking of anything else, but never of itself.  LEAVES OF GRASS. I SIT AND LOOK OUT.I SIT and look out upon all the sorrows of the world,         and upon all oppression and shame;I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at an-          guish with themselves, remorseful after deeds         done;I see, in low life, the mother misused by her children,         dying, neglected, gaunt, desperate;I see the wife misused by her husband—I see the         treacherous seducer of young women;I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love,         attempted to be hid—I see these sights on the         earth;I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny—I see         martyrs and prisoners;I observe a famine at sea—I observe the sailors casting         lots who shall be kill'd, to preserve the lives of         the rest;I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant         persons upon laborers, the poor, and upon ne-          groes, and the like;All these—All the meanness and agony without end, I         sitting, look out upon,See, hear, and am silent. ME IMPERTURBE.ME imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,Master of all, or mistress of all—aplomb in the midst         of irrational things,Imbued as they—passive, receptive, silent as they,Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles,         crimes, less important than I thought;  CROSSING BROOKLYN FERRY.11 
          FLOOD-TIDE below me! I watch you face to face;Clouds of the west! sun there half an hour high! I see         you also face to face.2 
          Crowds of men and women attired in the usual cos-          tumes! how curious you are to me!On the ferry-boats, the hundreds and hundreds that         cross, returning home, are more curious to me         than you suppose;And you that shall cross from shore to shore years         hence, are more to me, and more in my medita-          tions, than you might suppose.23 
          The impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at         all hours of the day;The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme—myself disin-          tegrated, every one disintegrated, yet part of the         scheme;The similitudes of the past, and those of the future;The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and         hearings—on the walk in the street, and the pas-          sage over the river;The current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me         far away;The others that are to follow me, the ties between me         and them;The certainty of others—the life, love, sight, hearing of         others.4 
          Others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from         shore to shore;Others will watch the run of the flood-tide;Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and         west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south         and east;Others will see the islands large and small;Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross,         the sun half an hour high;A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years         hence, others will see them,Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring in of the flood-tide,         the falling back to the sea of the ebb-tide.35 
          It avails not, neither time or place—distance avails         not;I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or         ever so many generations hence;I project myself—also I return—I am with you, and         know how it is.6 
          Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky,         so I felt;Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one         of a crowd;Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river         and the bright flow, I was refresh'd;Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with         the swift current, I stood, yet was hurried;Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and         the thick-stem'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.7 
          I too many and many a time cross'd the river, the sun         half an hour high;I watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls—I saw them         high in the air, floating with motionless wings,         oscillating their bodies,I saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their         bodies, and left the rest in strong shadow,I saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging         toward the south.8 
          I too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the         water,Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the         shape of my head in the sun-lit water,Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-          westward,Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with         violet,Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the arriving         ships,Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops—saw the         ships at anchor,The sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the         spars,The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the         slender serpentine pennants,The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in         their pilot-houses,The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous         whirl of the wheels,The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sun-set,The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups,         the frolicsome crests and glistening,The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray         walls of the granite store-houses by the docks,On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug         closely flank'd on each side by the barges—the         hay-boat, the belated lighter,On the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry         chimneys burning high and glaringly into the         night,9Casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red         and yellow light, over the tops of houses, and         down into the clefts of streets.49 
          These, and all else, were to me the same as they are         to you;I project myself a moment to tell you—also I return.10 
          I loved well those cities;I loved well the stately and rapid river;The men and women I saw were all near to me;Others the same—others who look back on me, because         I look'd forward to them;(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-          night.)511 
          What is it, then, between us?What is the count of the scores of hundreds of years         between us?12 
          Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and         place avails not.613 
          I too lived—Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine;I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan Island, and         bathed in the waters around it;I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within         me,In the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they         came upon me,In my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my bed,         they came upon me.14 
          I too had been struck from the float forever held in         solution;I too had receiv'd identity by my Body;That I was, I knew was of my body—and what I should         be, I knew I should be of my body.715 
          It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,The dark threw patches down upon me also;The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious;My great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they not         in reality meagre? would not people laugh at         me?16 
          It is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;I am he who knew what it was to be evil;I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly,         malignant;The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous         wish, not wanting,Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none         of these wanting.817 
          But I was Manhattanese, friendly and proud!I was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices         of young men as they saw me approaching or         passing,Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent         leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,Saw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public         assembly, yet never told them a word,Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing,         gnawing, sleeping,Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or         actress,The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as         great as we like,Or as small as we like, or both great and small.918 
          Closer yet I approach you;What thought you have of me, I had as much of you         —I laid in my stores in advance;I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were         born.19 
          Who was to know what should come home to me?Who knows but I am enjoying this?Who knows but I am as good as looking at you now,         for all you cannot see me?20 
          It is not you alone, nor I alone;Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few cen-          turies;It is that each came, or comes, or shall come, from its         due emission,From the general centre of all, and forming a part         of all:Everything indicates—the smallest does, and the largest         does;A necessary film envelopes all, and envelops the Soul         for a proper time.1021 
          Now I am curious what sight can ever be more         stately and admirable to me than my mast-          hemm'd Manhattan,My river and sun-set, and my scallop-edg'd waves of         flood-tide,The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in         the twilight, and the belated lighter;Curious what Gods can exceed these that clasp me by         the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly         and loudly by my nighest name as I approach;Curious what is more subtle than this which ties me to         the woman or man that looks in my face,Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning         into you.22 
          We understand, then, do we not?What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not         accepted?What the study could not teach—what the preaching         could not accomplish, is accomplish'd, is it not?What the push of reading could not start, is started by         me personally, is it not?1123 
          Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with         the ebb-tide!Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!Gorgeous clouds of the sun-set! drench with your         splendor me, or the men and women generations         after me;Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passen-          gers!Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!—stand up, beau-          tiful hills of Brooklyn!Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions         and answers!Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street,         or public assembly!Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically         call me by my nighest name!Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the         actor or actress!Play the old role, the role that is great or small, ac-          cording as one makes it!Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in         unknown ways be looking upon you;Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean         idly, yet haste with the hasting current;Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large cir-         cles high in the air;Receive the summer sky, you water! and faithfully hold         it, till all downcast eyes have time to take it         from you;Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my         head, or any one's head, in the sun-lit water; 199 WITH ANTECEDENTS.11 
          WITH antecedents;With my fathers and mothers, and the accumulations         of past ages;With all which, had it not been, I would not now be         here, as I am:With Egypt, India, Phenicia, Greece and Rome;With the Kelt, the Scandinavian, the Alb, and the         Saxon;With antique maritime ventures,—with laws, artizan-          ship, wars and journeys;With the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the         oracle;With the sale of slaves—with enthusiasts—with the         troubadour, the crusader, and the monk;With those old continents whence we have come to this         new continent;With the fading kingdoms and kings over there;With the fading religions and priests;With the small shores we look back to from our own         large and present shores;With countless years drawing themselves onward, and         arrived at these years;You and Me arrived—America arrived, and making         this year;This year! sending itself ahead countless years to come.22 
          O but it is not the years—it is I—it is You;We touch all laws, and tally all antecedents;We are the skald, the oracle, the monk, and the knight         —we easily include them, and more;We stand amid time, beginningless and endless—we         stand amid evil and good;All swings around us—there is as much darkness as         light;The very sun swings itself and its system of planets         around us;Its sun, and its again, all swing around us.3 
          As for me, (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehe-          ment days,)I have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all;I believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is true—         I reject no part.4 
          Have I forgotten any part?Come to me, whoever and whatever, till I give you         recognition.5 
          I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god;I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true,         without exception;I assert that all past days were what they should have         been;And that they could no-how have been better than they         were,And that to-day is what it should be—and that Amer-          ica is,And that to-day and America could no-how be better         than they are.36 
          In the name of These States, and in your and my         name, the Past,And in the name of These States, and in your and my         name, the Present time.7 
          I know that the past was great, and the future will be         great,And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present         time,(For the sake of him I typify—for the common average         man's sake—your sake, if you are he;)And that where I am, or you are, this present day, there         is the centre of all days, all races,And there is the meaning, to us, of all that has ever         come of races and days, or ever will come.  THE ANSWERER. NOW LIST TO MY MORNING'S ROMANZA.11 
          Now list to my morning's romanza—I tell the signs         of the Answerer;To the cities and farms I sing, as they spread in the         sunshine before me.2 
          A young man comes to me bearing a message from         his brother;How shall the young man know the whether and when         of his brother?Tell him to send me the signs.3 
          And I stand before the young man face to face, and         take his right hand in my left hand, and his left         hand in my right hand,And I answer for his brother, and for men, and I an-          swer for him that answers for all, and send these         signs.24 
          Him all wait for—him all yield up to—his word is         decisive and final,Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive them-          selves, as amid light,Him they immerse, and he immerses them.5 
          Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the         landscape, people, animals,The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet         ocean, (so tell I my morning's romanza;)All enjoyments and properties, and money, and what-          ever money will buy,The best farms—others toiling and planting, and he         unavoidably reaps,The noblest and costliest cities—others grading and         building, and he domiciles there;Nothing for any one, but what is for him—near and far         are for him, the ships in the offing,The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him,         if they are for any body.6 
          He puts things in their attitudes;He puts to-day out of himself, with plasticity and love;He places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents,         brothers and sisters, associations, employment,         politics, so that the rest never shame them after-          ward, nor assume to command them.7 
          He is the answerer;What can be answer'd he answers—and what cannot be         answer'd, he shows how it cannot be answer'd.38 
          A man is a summons and challenge;(It is vain to skulk—Do you hear that mocking and         laughter? Do you hear the ironical echoes?)9 
          Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, plea-          sure, pride, beat up and down, seeking to give         satisfaction;He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that         beat up and down also.10 
          Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he         may go freshly and gently and safely, by day or         by night;He has the pass-key of hearts—to Him the response of         the prying of hands on the knobs.11 
          His welcome is universal—the flow of beauty is not         more welcome or universal than he is;The person he favors by day, or sleeps with at night, is         blessed.412 
          Every existence has its idiom—everything has an         idiom and tongue;He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it         upon men, and any man translates, and any man         translates himself also;One part does not counteract another part—he is the         joiner—he sees how they join.13 
          He says indifferently and alike,  How are you, friend?          to the President at his levee,And he says,  Good-day, my brother!  to Cudge that hoes         in the sugar-field,And both understand him, and know that his speech is         right.14 
          He walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,He walks among the Congress, and one Representative         says to another,  Here is our equal, appearing and           new .15 
          Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the         sailors that he has follow'd the sea,And the authors take him for an author, and the artists         for an artist,And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and         love them;No matter what the work is, that he is the one to fol-          low it, or has follow'd it,No matter what the nation, that he might find his         brothers and sisters there,16 
          The English believe he comes of their English stock,A Jew to the Jew he seems—a Russ to the Russ—usual         and near, removed from none.17 
          Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house         claims him,The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is         sure, and the Spaniard is sure, and the island         Cuban is sure;The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on         the Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or Sacramento,         or Hudson, or Paumanok Sound, claims him.18 
          The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his         perfect blood;The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the         beggar, see themselves in the ways of him—he         strangely transmutes them,They are not vile any more—they hardly know them-          selves, they are so grown. THE INDICATIONS.1 
          THE indications, and tally of time;Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs;Time, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts;What always indicates the poet, is the crowd of the         pleasant company of singers, and their words;The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of         the light or dark—but the words of the maker         of poems are the general light and dark;The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immor-          tality,His insight and power encircle things and the human         race,He is the glory and extract thus far, of things, and of         the human race.2 
          The singers do not beget—only the POET begets;The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often         enough—but rare has the day been, likewise the         spot, of the birth of the maker of poems, the         Answerer,(Not every century, or every five centuries, has con-          tain'd such a day, for all its names.)3 
          The singers of successive hours of centuries may have         ostensible names, but the name of each of them         is one of the singers,The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-          singer, sweet-singer, echo-singer, parlor-singer,         love-singer, or something else.4 
          All this time, and at all times, wait the words of true         poems;The words of true poems do not merely please,The true poets are not followers of beauty, but the         august masters of beauty;The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness         of mothers and fathers,The words of poems are the tuft and final applause of         science.5 
          Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason,         health, rudeness of body, withdrawnness,Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness—such are some of the         words of poems.6 
          The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems,         the answerer;The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenolo-          gist, artist—all these underlie the maker of         poems, the answerer.7 
          The words of the true poems give you more than         poems,They give you to form for yourself, poems, religions,         politics, war, peace, behavior, histories, essays,         romances, and everything else,They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the         sexes,They do not seek beauty—they are sought,Forever touching them, or close upon them, follows         beauty, longing, fain, love-sick.3 
          They prepare for death—yet are they not the finish,         but rather the outset,They bring none to his or her terminus, or to be con-         tent and full;Whom they take, they take into space, to behold the         birth of stars, to learn one of the meanings,To launch off with absolute faith—to sweep through the         ceaseless rings, and never be quiet again. POETS TO COME.1 
          POETS to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!Not to-day is to justify me, and answer what I am         for;But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental,         greater than before known,Arouse! Arouse—for you must justify me—you must         answer.2 
          I myself but write one or two indicative words for the         future,I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back         in the darkness.3 
          I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stop-          ping, turns a casual look upon you, and then         averts his face,Leaving it to you to prove and define it,Expecting the main things from you. 208 A FARM PICTURE.THROUGH the ample open door of the peaceful country         barn,A sun-lit pasture field, with cattle and horses feeding;And haze, and vista, and the far horizon, fading away.  CAROL OF OCCUPATIONS.11 
          COME closer to me;Push close, my lovers, and take the best I possess!Yield closer and closer, and give me the best you pos-          sess.2 
          This is unfinished business with me—How is it with         you?(I was chill'd with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper         between us.)3 
          Male and Female!I pass so poorly with paper and types, I must pass with         the contact of bodies and souls.4 
          American masses!I do not thank you for liking me as I am, and liking         the touch of me—I know that it is good for you         to do so.25 
          This is the carol of occupations;In the labor of engines and trades, and the labor of         fields, I find the developments,And find the eternal meanings.6 
          Workmen and Workwomen!Were all educations, practical and ornamental, well dis-          play'd out of me, what would it amount to?Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise         statesman, what would it amount to?Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you,         would that satisfy you?7 
          The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms;A man like me, and never the usual terms.8 
          Neither a servant nor a master am I;I take no sooner a large price than a small price—I will         have my own, whoever enjoys me;I will be even with you, and you shall be even with me.9 
          If you stand at work in a shop, I stand as nigh as the         nighest in the same shop;If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I         demand as good as your brother or dearest friend;If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night,         I must be personally as welcome;If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so         for your sake;If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do         you think I cannot remember my own foolish         and outlaw'd deeds?If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite         side of the table;If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him         or her—why I often meet strangers in the street,         and love them.10 
          Why, what have you thought of yourself?Is it you then that thought yourself less?Is it you that thought the President greater than you?Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser         than you?11 
          Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you were         once drunk, or a thief,

Or diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute—or are so now;Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no         scholar, and never saw your name in print,Do you give in that you are any less immortal?312 
          Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen,         unheard, untouchable and untouching;It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to         settle whether you are alive or no;I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.13 
          Grown, half-grown, and babe, of this country and         every country, in-doors and out-doors, one just         as much as the other, I see,And all else behind or through them.14 
          The wife—and she is not one jot less than the         husband;The daughter—and she is just as good as the son;The mother—and she is every bit as much as the         father.15 
          Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to         trades,Young fellows working on farms, and old fellows work-          ing on farms,Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,All these I see—but nigher and farther the same I         see;None shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape         me.16 
          I bring what you much need, yet always have,Not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good;I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of         value, but offer the value itself.17 
          There is something that comes home to one now         and perpetually;It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed—it eludes         discussion and print;It is not to be put in a book—it is not in this book;It is for you, whoever you are—it is no farther from         you than your hearing and sight are from you;It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest—it is ever         provoked by them.18 
          You may read in many languages, yet read nothing         about it;You may read the President's Message, and read noth-          ing about it there;Nothing in the reports from the State department or         Treasury department, or in the daily papers or         the weekly papers,Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or         any accounts of stock.419 
          The sun and stars that float in the open air;The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it—surely the         drift of them is something grand!I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and         that it is happiness,And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a         speculation, or bon-mot, or reconnoissance,And that it is not something which by luck may turn         out well for us, and without luck must be a failure         for us,And not something which may yet be retracted in a         certain contingency.20 
          The light and shade, the curious sense of body and         identity, the greed that with perfect complais-          ance devours all things, the endless pride and         out-stretching of man, unspeakable joys and         sorrows,The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees,         and the wonders that fill each minute of time         forever,

What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?Have you reckon'd them for a trade, or farm-work? or         for the profits of a store?Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentle-          man's leisure, or a lady's leisure?21 
          Have you reckon'd the landscape took substance and         form that it might be painted in a picture?Or men and women that they might be written of, and         songs sung?Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and         harmonious combinations, and the fluids of the         air, as subjects for the savans?Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and         charts?Or the stars to be put in constellations and named         fancy names?Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables,         or agriculture itself?22 
          Old institutions—these arts, libraries, legends, col-          lections, and the practice handed along in man-          ufactures—will we rate them so high?Will we rate our cash and business high?—I have no         objection;I rate them as high as the highest—then a child born         of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate.23 
          We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution         grand;I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are;I am this day just as much in love with them as you;Then I am in love with you, and with all my fellows         upon the earth.24 
          We consider bibles and religions divine—I do not say         they are not divine;I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out         of you still;It is not they who give the life—it is you who give the         life;Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from         the earth, than they are shed out of you.525 
          When the psalm sings instead of the singer;When the script preaches, instead of the preacher;When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the         carver that carved the supporting desk;When I can touch the body of books, by night or by         day, and when they touch my body back again;When a university course convinces, like a slumbering         woman and child convince;When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the         night watchman's daughter;When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are         my friendly companions;I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of         them as I do of men and women like you.26 
          The sum of all known reverence I add up in you,         whoever you are;The President is there in the White House for you—it         is not you who are here for him;The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you—not you         here for them;The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you;Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of         cities, the going and coming of commerce and         mails, are all for you.27 
          List close, my scholars dear!All doctrines, all politics and civilization, exurge from         you;All sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed         anywhere, are tallied in you;The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the         records reach, is in you this hour, and myths and         tales the same;If you were not breathing and walking here, where         would they all be?The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and         plays would be vacuums.28 
          All architecture is what you do to it when you look         upon it;(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or         the lines of the arches and cornices?)29 
          All music is what awakes from you, when you are         reminded by the instruments;It is not the violins and the cornets—it is not the oboe         nor the beating drums, nor the score of the         baritone singer singing his sweet romanza—nor         that of the men's chorus, nor that of the women's         chorus,It is nearer and farther than they.630 
          Will the whole come back then?Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-          glass? is there nothing greater or more?Does all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen         Soul?31 
          Strange and hard that paradox true I give;Objects gross and the unseen Soul are one.32 
          House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering,         tin-roofing, shingle-dressing,Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flag-          ging of side-walks by flaggers,The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-          kiln and brick-kiln,Coal-mines, and all that is down there,—the lamps in         the darkness, echoes, songs, what meditations,         what vast native thoughts looking through         smutch'd faces,Iron works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the         river-banks—men around feeling the melt with         huge crowbars—lumps of ore, the due combining         of ore, limestone, coal—the blast-furnace and the         puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom         of the melt at last—the rolling-mill, the stumpy         bars of pig-iron, the strong, clean-shaped T-rail         for railroads;Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house,         steam-saws, the great mills and factories;Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for façades, or window         or door-lintels—the mallet, the tooth-chisel, the         jib to protect the thumb,Oakum, the oakum-chisel, the caulking-iron,—the kettle         of boiling vault-cement, and the fire under the         kettle,The cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck         of the sawyer, the mould of the moulder, the         working-knife of the butcher, the ice-saw, and all         the work with ice,The implements for daguerreotyping—the tools of the         rigger, grappler, sail-maker, block-maker,Goods of gutta-percha, papier-mach, colors, brushes,         brush-making, glazier's implements,The veneer and glue-pot, the confectioner's ornaments,         the decanter and glasses, the shears and flat-iron,The awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart         measure, the counter and stool, the writing-pen         of quill or metal—the making of all sorts of         edged tools,The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, every thing         that is done by brewers, also by wine-makers,         also vinegar-makers,Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-          twisting, distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning,         cotton-picking—electro-plating, electrotyping,         stereotyping,Stave-machines, planing-machines, reaping-machines,         ploughing-machines, thrashing-machines, steam         wagons,The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous         dray;Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fire-works at night, fancy         figures and jets;Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the         butcher, the butcher in his killing-clothes,The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-          hook, the scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's         cleaver, the packer's maul, and the plenteous         winter-work of pork-packing;Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice—the         barrels and the half and quarter barrels, the         loaded barges, the high piles on wharves and         levees;The men, and the work of the men, on railroads,         coasters, fish-boats, canals;The daily routine of your own or any man's life—the         shop, yard, store, or factory;These shows all near you by day and night—workman!         whoever you are, your daily life!In that and them the heft of the heaviest—in them far         more than you estimated, and far less also;In them realities for you and me—in them poems for         you and me;In them, not yourself—you and your Soul enclose all         things, regardless of estimation;In them the development good—in them, all themes         and hints.33 
          I do not affirm what you see beyond is futile—I do         not advise you to stop;I do not say leadings you thought great are not great;But I say that none lead to greater, than those lead to.734 
          Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at         last,In things best known to you, finding the best, or as         good as the best,In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest,         lovingest; 218 THOUGHTS.1OF ownership—As if one fit to own things could not at         pleasure enter upon all, and incorporate them         into himself or herself.2Of waters, forests, hills;Of the earth at large, whispering through medium of         me;Of vista—Suppose some sight in arriere, through the         formative chaos, presuming the growth, fulness,         life, now attain'd on the journey;(But I see the road continued, and the journey ever         continued;)—Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time         has become supplied—And of what will yet be         supplied,Because all I see and know, I believe to have purport         in what will yet be supplied.  THE SLEEPERS.11 
          I WANDER all night in my vision,Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly step-         ping and stopping,Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted,         contradictory,Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.2 
          How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still!How quiet they breathe, the little children in their         cradles!3 
          The wretched features of ennuyés, the white features         of corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-          gray faces of onanists,The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their         strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-          born emerging from gates, and the dying emerg-          ing from gates,The night pervades them and infolds them.4 
          The married couple sleep calmly in their bed—he         with his palm on the hip of the wife, and she         with her palm on the hip of the husband,The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,And the mother sleeps, with her little child carefully         wrapt.5 
          The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,The prisoner sleeps well in the prison—the run-away         son sleeps;The murderer that is to be hung next day—how does         he sleep?And the murder'd person—how does he sleep?6 
          The female that loves unrequited sleeps,And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,The head of the money-maker that plotted all day         sleeps,And the enraged and treacherous dispositions—all, all         sleep.27 
          I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-          suffering and the most restless,I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches         from them,The restless sink in their beds—they fitfully sleep.8 
          Now I pierce the darkness—new beings appear,The earth recedes from me into the night,I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not         the earth is beautiful.9 
          I go from bedside to bedside—I sleep close with the         other sleepers, each in turn,I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dream-          ers,And I become the other dreamers.310 
          I am a dance—Play up, there! the fit is whirling me         fast!11 
          I am the ever-laughing—it is new moon and twi-          light,I see the hiding of douceurs—I see nimble ghosts         whichever way I look,Cache, and cache again, deep in the ground and sea,         and where it is neither ground or sea.12 
          Well do they do their jobs, those journeymen divine,Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if         they could,I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet         besides,And surround me and lead me, and run ahead when I         walk,To lift their cunning covers, to signify me with stretch'd         arms, and resume the way;Onward we move! a gay gang of blackguards! with         mirth-shouting music, and wild-flapping pennants         of joy!413 
          I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician;The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in         the box,He who has been famous, and he who shall be famous         after to-day,The stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or         feeble person.514 
          I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair         pectantly,My truant lover has come, and it is dark.15 
          Double yourself and receive me, darkness!Receive me and my lover too—he will not let me go         without him.16 
          I roll myself upon you, as upon a bed—I resign my-          self to the dusk.617 
          He whom I call answers me, and takes the place of         my lover,He rises with me silently from the bed.18 
          Darkness! you are gentler than my lover—his flesh         was sweaty and panting,I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.19 
          My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all direc-          tions,I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are         journeying.20 
          Be careful, darkness! already, what was it touch'd         me?I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are         one,I hear the heart-beat—I follow, I fade away.721 
          O hot-cheek'd and blushing! O foolish hectic!O for pity's sake, no one must see me now! my clothes         were stolen while I was abed,Now I am thrust forth, where shall I run?22 
          Pier that I saw dimly last night, when I look'd from         the windows!Pier out from the main, let me catch myself with you,         and stay—I will not chafe you,I feel ashamed to go naked about the world.23 
          I am curious to know where my feet stand—and what         this is flooding me, childhood or manhood—and         the hunger that crosses the bridge between.824 
          The cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking,Laps life-swelling yolks—laps ear of rose-corn, milky         and just ripen'd;The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in         darkness,And liquor is spill'd on lips and bosoms by touching         glasses, and the best liquor afterward.925 
          I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,Perfume and youth course through me, and I am their         wake.26 
          It is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old         woman's,I sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn         my grandson's stockings.27 
          It is I too, the sleepless widow, looking out on the         winter midnight,I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid         earth.28 
          A shroud I see, and I am the shroud—I wrap a body,         and lie in the coffin,It is dark here under ground—it is not evil or pain here         —it is blank here, for reasons.29 
          It seems to me that everything in the light and air         ought to be happy,Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him         know he has enough.1030 
          I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer, swimming naked         through the eddies of the sea,His brown hair lies close and even to his head—he         strikes out with courageous arms—he urges him-          self with his legs,I see his white body—I see his undaunted eyes,I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him         head-foremost on the rocks.31 
          What are you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled waves?Will you kill the courageous giant ? Will you kill him         in the prime of his middle age ?32 
          Steady and long he struggles,He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd—he holds out while his         strength holds out,The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood—they         bear him away—they roll him, swing him, turn         him,His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is         continually bruis'd on rocks.         Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.1133 
          I turn, but do not extricate myself,Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness         yet.34 
          The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind—the wreck-          guns sound,The tempest lulls—the moon comes floundering through         the drifts.35 
          I look where the ship helplessly heads end on—I hear         the burst as she strikes—I hear the howls of         dismay—they grow fainter and fainter.36 
          I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,I can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and         freeze upon me.37 
          I search with the crowd—not one of the company is         wash'd to us alive;In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them         in rows in a barn.1238 
          Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,Washington stands inside the lines—he stands on the         intrench'd hills, amid a crowd of officers,His face is cold and damp—he cannot repress the weep-          ing drops,He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes—the color is         blanch'd from his cheeks,He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to         him by their parents.39 
          The same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,He stands, in the room of the old tavern—the well-          belov'd soldiers all pass through,The officers speechless and slow draw near in their         turns,The chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses         them on the cheek,He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another—he         shakes hands, and bids good-by to the army.1340 
          Now I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat         at dinner together,Of when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with         her parents on the old homestead.41 
          A red squaw came one breakfast time to the old         homestead,On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-          bottoming chairs,Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-          envelop'd her face,Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded         exquisitely as she spoke.42 
          My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the         stranger,She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and         full and pliant limbs,The more she look'd upon her, she loved her,Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and         purity,She made her sit on a bench by the jamb or the fire-          place—she cook'd food for her,She had no work to give her, but she gave her remem-          brance and fondness.43 
          The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the         middle of the afternoon she went away,O my mother was loth to have her go away!All the week she thought of her—she watch'd for her         many a month,She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,But the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there         again.1444 
          Now Lucifer was not dead—or if he was, I am his         sorrowful terrible heir;I have been wrong'd—I am oppress'd—I hate him that         oppresses me,I will either destroy him, or he shall release me.45 
          Damn him! how he does defile me!How he informs against my brother and sister, and         takes pay for their blood!How he laughs when I look down the bend, after the         steamboat that carries away my woman!46 
          Now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk, it         seems mine;Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and slug-         gish, the tap of my flukes is death.1547 
          A show of the summer softness! a contact of some-          thing unseen! an amour of the light and air!I am jealous, and overwhelm'd with friendliness,And will go gallivant with the light and air myself,And have an unseen something to be in contact with         them also.48 
          O love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in         me!Autumn and winter are in the dreams—the farmer         goes with his thrift,The droves and crops increase, and the barns are well-          fill'd.1649 
          Elements merge in the night—ships make tacks in         the dreams,The sailor sails—the exile returns home,The fugitive returns unharm'd—the immigrant is back         beyond months and years,The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his         childhood, with the well-known neighbors and         faces,They warmly welcome him—he is barefoot again, he         forgets he is well off;The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and         Welshman voyage home, and the native of the         Mediterranean voyages home,To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-         fill'd ships,The Swiss foots it toward his hills—the Prussian goes         his way, the Hungarian his way, and the Pole         his way,The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian re-          turn.1750 
          The homeward bound, and the outward bound,The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist,         the female that loves unrequited, the money-          maker,The actor and actress, those through with their parts,         and those waiting to commence,The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter,         the nominee that is chosen, and the nominee that         has fail'd,The great already known, and the great any time after         to-day,The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat         and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury,         the audience,The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight         widow, the red squaw,The consumptive, the erysipelite, the idiot, he that is         wrong'd,The antipodes, and every one between this and them in         the dark,I swear they are averaged now—one is no better than         the other,The night and sleep have likened them and restored         them.51 
          I swear they are all beautiful;Every one that sleeps is beautiful—everything in the         dim light is beautiful,The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.1852 
          Peace is always beautiful,The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.53 
          The myth of heaven indicates the Soul;The Soul is always beautiful—it appears more or it         appears less—it comes, or it lags behind,It comes from its embower'd garden, and looks pleasantly         on itself, and encloses the world,Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and         perfect and clean the womb cohering,The head well-grown, proportion'd and plumb, and the         bowels and joints proportion'd and plumb.1954 
          The Soul is always beautiful,The universe is duly in order, everything is in its place,What has arrived is in its place, and what waits is in         its place;The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood         waits,The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and         the child of the drunkard waits long, and the         drunkard himself waits long,The sleepers that liv'd and died wait—the far advanced         are to go on in their turns, and the far behind         are to come on in their turns,The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall         flow and unite—they unite now.2055 
          The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,They flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from         east to west, as they lie unclothed,The Asiatic and African are hand in hand—the Euro-         pean and American are hand in hand,Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and         female are hand in hand,The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her         lover—they press close without lust—his lips         press her neck,The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms         with measureless love, and the son holds the         father in his arms with measureless love,The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist         of the daughter,The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man,         friend is inarm'd by friend,The scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses         the scholar—the wrong'd is made right,The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and         the master salutes the slave,  CAROL OF WORDS.11 
          EARTH, round, rolling, compact—suns, moons, ani-          mals—all these are words to be said;Watery, vegetable, sauroid advances—beings, premoni-          tions, lispings of the future,Behold! these are vast words to be said.2 
          Were you thinking that those were the words—those         upright lines? those curves, angles, dots?No, those are not the words—the substantial words are         in the ground and sea,They are in the air—they are in you.3 
          Were you thinking that those were the words—those         delicious sounds out of your friends' mouths?No, the real words are more delicious than they.4 
          Human bodies are words, myriads of words;In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or wo-          man's, well-shaped, natural, gay,Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the         need of shame.25 
          Air, soil, water, fire—these are words;I myself am a word with them—my qualities interpene-          trate with theirs—my name is nothing to them;Though it were told in the three thousand languages,         what would air, soil, water, fire, know of my         name?6 
          A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding ges-          ture, are words, sayings, meanings;The charms that go with the mere looks of some men         and women, are sayings and meanings also.37 
          The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words         of the earth;The great masters know the earth's words, and use         them more than the audible words.8 
          Amelioration is one of the earth's words;The earth neither lags nor hastens;It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself         from the jump;It is not half beautiful only—defects and excrescences         show just as much as perfections show.9 
          The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not         so conceal'd either;They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;They are imbued through all things, conveying them-          selves willingly,Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth—I         utter and utter,I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail am I         to you?To bear—to better—lacking these, of what avail am I?410 
          Accouche! Accouchez!Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?Will you squat and stifle there?11 
          The earth does not argue,

Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none         out.512 
          The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to ex-          hibit itself—possesses still underneath;Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus         of heroes, the wail of slaves,Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying,         laughter of young people, accents of bargain-          ers,Underneath these, possessing the words that never         fail.13 
          To her children, the words of the eloquent dumb         great mother never fail;The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail,         and reflection does not fail;Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we         pursue does not fail.614 
          Of the interminable sisters,Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and         younger sisters,The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.15 
          With her ample back towards every beholder,With the fascinations of youth, and the equal fascina-          tions of age,Sits she whom I too love like the rest—sits undis-          turb'd,Holding up in her hand what has the character of a         mirror, while her eyes glance back from it,

Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her         own face.716 
          Seen at hand, or seen at a distance,Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,Duly approach and pass with their companions, or a         companion,Looking from no countenances of their own, but from         the countenances of those who are with them,From the countenances of children or women, or the         manly countenance,From the open countenances of animals, or from inani-          mate things,From the landscape or waters, or from the exquisite         apparition of the sky,From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully re-          turning them,Every day in public appearing without fail, but never         twice with the same companions.817 
          Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three         hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the         sun;Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three         hundred and sixty-five offsets of the first, sure         and necessary as they.918 
          Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever, withstanding, pass-          ing, carrying,The Soul's realization and determination still inherit-          ing,The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and         dividing,No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock         striking,Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,Of all able and ready at any time to give strict ac-          count,The divine ship sails the divine sea.1019 
          Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especi-          ally for you;The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.20 
          Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the         earth is solid and liquid,You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in         the sky,For none more than you are the present and the past,For none more than you is immortality.1121 
          Each man to himself, and each woman to herself,         such is the word of the past and present, and         the word of immortality;No one can acquire for another—not one!Not one can grow for another—not one!22 
          The song is to the singer, and comes back most to         him;The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to         him;The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most         to him;The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him;The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him—         it cannot fail;The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor         and actress, not to the audience;And no man understands any greatness or goodness         but his own, or the indication of his own.23 
          I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or         her who shall be complete!I swear the earth remains jagged and broken only to         him or her who remains jagged and broken!24 
          I swear there is no greatness or power that does not         emulate those of the earth!I swear there can be no theory of any account, unless it         corroborate the theory of the earth!No politics, art, religion, behavior, or what not, is of         account, unless it compare with the amplitude of         the earth,Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, recti-          tude of the earth.1325 
          I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than         that which responds love!It is that which contains itself—which never invites,         and never refuses.26 
          I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible         words!I swear I think all merges toward the presentation of         the unspoken meanings of the earth!Toward him who sings the songs of the Body, and of         the truths of the earth;Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that         print cannot touch.1427 
          I swear I see what is better than to tell the best;It is always to leave the best untold.28 
          When I undertake to tell the best, I find I cannot,My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,My breath will not be obedient to its organs,I become a dumb man.29 
          The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow—all or         any is best;It is not what you anticipated—it is cheaper, easier,         nearer;Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held         before;The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before;Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as         real as before;But the Soul is also real,—it too is positive and direct;No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,Undeniable growth has establish'd it.1530 
          This is a poem—a carol of words—these are hints of         meanings,These are to echo the tones of Souls, and the phrases         of Souls;If they did not echo the phrases of Souls, what were         they then?If they had not reference to you in especial, what were         they then?31 
          I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the         faith that tells the best!I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the         best untold.1632 
          Say on, sayers!Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!Work on—(it is materials you must bring, not breaths;)Work on, age after age! nothing is to be lost;It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in         use;When the materials are all prepared, the architects         shall appear.33 
          I swear to you the architects shall appear without         fail! I announce them and lead them; 238 Ah Poverties, Wincings, and Sulky Retreats.AH poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats!Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me!(For what is my life, or any man's life, but a conflict         with foes—the old, the incessant war?)You degradations—you tussle with passions and appe-          tites;You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds,         the sharpest of all;)You toil of painful and choked articulations—you mean-          nesses;You shallow tongue-talks at tables, (my tongue the         shallowest of any;)You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smoth-          er'd ennuis;Ah, think not you finally triumph—My real self has yet         to come forth;It shall yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies be-          neath me;It shall yet stand up the soldier of unquestion'd victory.  LEAVES OF GRASS. A BOSTON BALLAD. (1854.)1 
          To get betimes in Boston town, I rose this morning         early;Here's a good place at the corner—I must stand and         see the show.2 
          Clear the way there, Jonathan!Way for the President's marshal! Way for the govern-          ment cannon!Way for the Federal foot and dragoons—and the appa-         ritions copiously tumbling.3 
          I love to look on the stars and stripes—I hope the         fifes will play Yankee Doodle.4 
          How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through         Boston town.5 
          A fog follows—antiques of the same come limping,Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear ban-         daged and bloodless.6 
          Why this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out         of the earth!The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!Cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoul-          ders!7 
          What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all         this clattering of bare gums?Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake         your crutches for firelocks, and level them?8 
          If you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the         President's marshal;If you groan such groans, you might balk the govern-          ment cannon.9 
          For shame old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd         arms, and let your white hair be;Here gape your great grand-sons—their wives gaze at         them from the windows,See how well dress'd—see how orderly they conduct         themselves.10 
          Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you         retreating?Is this hour with the living too dead for you?11 
          Retreat then! Pell-mell!To your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!I do not think you belong here, anyhow.12 
          But there is one thing that belongs here—shall I tell         you what it is, gentlemen of Boston?13 
          I will whisper it to the Mayor—he shall send a com-          mittee to England;They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a         cart to the royal vault—haste!Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from         the grave-clothes, box up his bones for a journey;Find a swift Yankee clipper—here is freight for you,         black-bellied clipper,Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer         straight toward Boston bay.14 
          Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out         the government cannon,Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another         procession, guard it with foot and dragoons.15 
          This centre-piece for them:Look! all orderly citizens—look from the windows,         women!16 
          The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs,         glue those that will not stay,Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on         top of the skull.17 
          You have got your revenge, old buster! The crown         has come to its own, and more than its own.18 
          Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan—you are         a made man from this day;You are mighty cute—and here is one of your bargains. YEAR OF METEORS.(1859–60.)YEAR of meteors! brooding year!I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds         and signs;I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad;.I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair,         mounted the scaffold in Virginia;(I was at hand—silent I stood, with teeth shut close—I         watch'd;I stood very near you, old man, when cool and indiffer-         ent, but trembling with age and your unheal'd         wounds, you mounted the scaffold;)—I would sing in my copious song your census returns         of The States,The tables of population and products—I would sing of         your ships and their cargoes,11  A BROADWAY PAGEANT.RECEPTION JAPANESE EMBASSY, JUNE, 1860.11 
          OVER the western sea, hither from Niphon come,Courteous the swart-cheek'd, two-sworded envoys,Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed,         impassive,Ride to-day through Manhattan.2 
          Libertad!I do not know whether others behold what I behold,In the procession, along with the nobles of Asia, the         errand-bearers,Bringing up the rear, hovering-above, around, or in the         ranks marching;But I will sing you a song of what I behold, Libertad.23 
          When million-footed Manhattan, unpent, descends to         her pavements;When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the         proud roar I love;When the round-mouth'd guns, out of the smoke and         smell I love, spit their salutes;When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me—         when heaven-clouds canopy my city with a         delicate thin haze;When, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the for-          ests at the wharves, thicken with colors;When every ship, richly drest, carries her flag at the         peak;When pennants trail, and street-festoons hang from the         windows;When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers         and foot-standers—when the mass is densest;When the façades of the houses are alive with people—         when eyes gaze, riveted, tens of thousands at a         time;When the guests from the islands advance—when the         pageant moves forward, visible;When the summons is made—when the answer that         waited thousands of years, answers;I too, arising, answering, descend to the payements,         merge with the crowd, and gaze with them.34 
          Superb-faced Manhattan!Comrade Americanos!—to us, then, at last, the Orient         comes.5 
          To us, my city,Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on         opposite sides—to walk in the space between,To-day our Antipodes comes.6 
          The Originatress comes,The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the         race of eld,Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with         passion,Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering         eyes,The race of Brahma comes!47 
          See, my cantabile! these, and more, are flashing to us         from the procession;As it moves, changing, a kaleidoscope, divine it moves,         changing, before us.8 
          For not the envoys, nor the tann'd Japanee, from his         island only;Lithe and silent, the Hindoo appears—the Asiatic con-          tinent itself appears—the Past, the dead,The murky night-morning of wonder and fable, inscru-          table,The enveloped mysteries, the old and unknown hive-          bees,The North—the sweltering South—eastern Assyria—         the Hebrews—the Ancient of Ancients,Vast desolated cities—the gliding Present—all of these,         and more, are in the pageant-procession.9 
          Geography, the world, is in it;The great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the         coast beyond;The coast you, henceforth, are facing—you Libertad!         from your Western golden shoresThe countries there, with their populations—the mil-          lions en-masse, are curiously here;The swarming market places—the temples, with idols         ranged along the sides, or at the end—bonze,         brahmin, and lama;The mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisher-          man;The singing-girl and the dancing-girl—the ecstatic         person—the secluded Emperors,Confucius himself—the great poets and heroes—the         warriors, the castes, all,Trooping up, crowding from all directions—from the         Altay mountains,From Thibet—from the four winding and far-flowing         rivers of China,From the Southern peninsulas, and the demi-conti-          nental islands—from Malaysia;These, and whatever belongs to them, palpable, show         forth to me, and are seiz'd by me,And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,Till, as here, them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves         and for you.510 
          For I too, raising my voice, join the ranks of this         pageant;I am the chanter—I chant aloud over the pageant;I chant the world on my Western Sea;I chant, copious, the islands beyond, thick as stars in         the sky;I chant the new empire, grander than any before—As         in a vision it comes to me;I chant America, the Mistress—I chant a greater su-          premacy;I chant, projected, a thousand blooming cities yet, in         time, on those groups of sea-islands;I chant my sail-ships and steam-ships threading the         archipelagoes;I chant my stars and stripes fluttering in the wind;I chant commerce opening, the sleep of ages having         done its work—races, reborn, refresh'd;Lives, works, resumed—The object I know not—but         the old, the Asiatic, renew'd, as it must be,Commencing from this day, surrounded by the world.611 
          And you, Libertad of the world!You shall sit in the middle, well-pois'd, thousands of         years;As to-day, from one side, the nobles of Asia come to         you;As to-morrow, from the other side, the Queen of Eng-          land sends her eldest son to you.712 
          The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,The ring is circled, the journey is done;The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd—nevertheless the         perfume pours copiously out of the whole box.813 
          Young Libertad!With the venerable Asia, the all-mother,Be considerate with her, now and ever, hot Libertad—         for you are all;Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother, now         sending messages over the archipelagoes to you;Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.914 
          Were the children straying westward so long? so         wide the tramping?Were the precedent dim ages debouching westwardfrom Paradise so long?Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the         while unknown, for you, for reasons?15 
          They are justified—they are accomplish'd—they shall         now be turn'd the other way also, to travel to-          ward you thence;They shall now also march obediently eastward, for         your sake, Libertad. 248 SUGGESTIONS.1THAT whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person         —That is finally right.2That the human shape or face is so great, it must never         be made ridiculous;That for ornaments nothing outr can be allowed,That anything is most beautiful without ornament;That exaggerations will be sternly revenged in your         own physiology, and in other persons' physiol-         ogy also;That clean-shaped children can be jetted and conceiv'd         only where natural forms prevail in public, and         the human face and form are never caricatured;And that genius need never more be turn'd to ro-          mances.(For facts properly told, how mean appear all ro-          mances.)3I have said many times that materials and the Soul are         great, and that all depends on physique;Now I reverse what I said, and suggest that all depends         on the sthetic, or intellectual,And that criticism is great—and that refinement is         greatest of all;And that the mind governs—and that all depends on         the mind.4With one man or woman—(no matter which one—I         even pick out the lowest,)With him or her I now suggest the whole law;And that every right, in politics or what-not, shall be         eligible to that one man or woman, on the same         terms as any.View Page   GREAT ARE THE MYTHS.11 
          GREAT are the myths—I too delight in them;Great are Adam and Eve—I too look back and accept         them;Great the risen and fallen nations and their poets,         women, sages, inventors, rulers, warriors, and         priests.2 
          Great is Liberty! great is Equality! I am their fol-          lower;Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where you         sail, I sail,I weather it out with you, or sink with you.3 
          Great is Youth—equally great is Old Age—great are         the Day and Night;Great is Wealth—great is Poverty—great is Expression         —great is Silence.4 
          Youth, large, lusty, loving—Youth, full of grace, force,         fascination!Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with         equal grace, force, fascination?5 
          Day, full-blown and splendid—Day of the immense         sun, action, ambition, laughter,The Night follows close, with millions of suns, and         sleep, and restoring darkness.6 
          Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospi-          tality;But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowl-          edge, pride, enfolding love;(Who goes for men and women showing Poverty richer         than wealth?)7 
          Expression of speech! in what is written or said, for         -get not that Silence is also expressive,That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as         cold as the coldest, may be without words.28 
          Great is the Earth, and the way it became what it is;Do you imagine it has stopt at this? the increase aban-          don'd?Understand then that it goes as far onward from this,         as this is from the times when it lay in covering         waters and gases, before man had appear'd.9 
          Great is the quality of Truth in man;The quality of truth in man supports itself through all         changes,It is inevitably in the man—he and it are in love, and         never leave each other.10 
          The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eye-          sight;If there be any Soul, there is truth—if there be man or         woman there is truth—if there be physical or         moral, there is truth;If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth—if         there be things at all upon the earth, there is         truth.11 
          O truth of the earth! I am determin'd to press my         way toward you;Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the         sea after you.312 
          Great is Language—it is the mightiest of the sci-          ences,It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, and         of men and women, and of all qualities and pro-          cesses;It is greater than wealth—it is greater than buildings,         ships, religions, paintings, music.13 
          Great is the English speech—what speech is so great         as the English?Great is the English brood—what brood has so vast a         destiny as the English?It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth         with the new rule;The new rule shall rule as the Soul rules, and as the         love, justice, equality in the Soul rule.14 
          Great is Law—great are the few old land-marks of         the law,They are the same in all times, and shall not be dis-          turb'd.415 
          Great is Justice!Justice is not settled by legislators and laws—it is in         the Soul;It cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love,         pride, the attraction of gravity, can;It is immutable—it does not depend on majorities—         majorities or what not, come at last before the         same passionless and exact tribunal.16 
          For justice are the grand natural lawyers, and per-          fect judges—is it in their Souls;It is well assorted—they have not studied for nothing         —the great includes the less;They rule on the highest grounds—they oversee all         eras, states, administrations. 252 Thought.OF persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth,         scholarships, and the like;To me, all that those persons have arrived at, sinks         away from them, except as it results to their         Bodies and Souls,So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked;And often, to me, each one mocks the others, and mocks         himself or herself,And of each one, the core of life, namely happiness, is         full of the rotten excrement of maggots,And often, to me, those men and women pass unwit-          tingly the true realities of life, and go toward         false realities,And often, to me, they are alive after what custom has         served them, but nothing more,And often, to me, they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnam-          bules, walking the dusk.  LEAVES OF GRASS. THERE WAS A CHILD WENT FORTH.1 
          THERE was a child went forth every day;And the first object he look'd upon, that object he         became;And that object became part of him for the day, or a         certain part of the day, or for many years, or         stretching cycles of years.2 
          The early lilacs became part of this child,And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and         white and red clover, and the song of the phoebe-          bird,And the Third-month lambs, and the sow's pink-faint         litter, and the mare's foal, and the cow's calf,And the noisy brood of the barn-yard, or by the mire         of the pond-side,And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below         there—and the beautiful curious liquid,And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads—all         became part of him.3 
          The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month         became part of him;Winter-grain sprouts, and those of the light-yellow         corn, and the esculent roots of the garden,And the apple-trees cover'd with blossoms, and the fruit         afterward, and wood-berries, and the commonest         weeds by the road;And the old drunkard staggering home from the out-          house of the tavern, whence he had lately risen,And the school-mistress that pass'd on her way to the         school,And the friendly boys that pass'd—and the quarrelsome         boys,And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls—and the barefoot         negro boy and girl,And all the changes of city and country, wherever he         went.4 
          His own parents,He that had father'd him, and she had conceiv'd         him in her womb, and birth'd him,They gave this child more of themselves than that;They gave him afterward every day—they became part         of him.5 
          The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on         the supper-table;The mother with mild words—clean her cap and gown,         a wholesome odor falling off her person and         clothes as she walks by;The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd,         unjust;The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the         crafty lure,The family usages, the language, the company, the fur-          niture—the yearning and swelling heart,Affection that will not be gainsay'd—the sense of what         is real—the thought if, after all, it should prove         unreal,The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time—         the curious whether and how,Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes         and specks?Men and women crowding fast in the streets—if they         are not flashes and specks, what are they?The streets themselves, and the façades of houses, and         goods in the windows,Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves—the huge         crossing at the ferries,The village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset—         the river between,Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs         and gables of white or brown, three miles off,The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide         —the little boat slack-tow'd astern,The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests,         slapping,The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon-          tint, away solitary by itself—the spread of purity         it lies motionless in,The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance         of salt marsh and shore mud;These became part of that child who went forth every         day, and who now goes, and will always go forth         every day. LONGINGS FOR HOME.O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, perfumed South! My         South!O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good         and evil! O all dear to me!O dear to me my birth-things—All moving things, and         the trees where I was born—the grains, plants,         rivers;Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they         flow, distant, over flats of silvery sands, or         through swamps;Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw,         the Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee, the Coosa,         and the Sabine;O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my Soul         to haunt their banks again;Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes—I float         on the Okeechobee—I cross the hummock land,         or through pleasant openings, or dense forests;I see the parrots in the woods—I see the papaw tree         and the blossoming titi;Again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, I coast off         Georgia—I coast up the Carolinas,I see where the live-oak is growing—I see where the         yellow-pine, the scented bay-tree, the lemon and         orange, the cypress, the graceful palmetto;I pass rude sea-headlands and enter Pamlico Sound         through an inlet, and dart my vision inland;O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar,         hemp!The cactus, guarded with thorns—the laurel-tree, with         large white flowers;The range afar—the richness and barrenness—the old         woods charged with mistletoe and training moss,The piney odor and the gloom—the awful natural still-          ness, (Here in these dense swamps the freebooter         carries his gun, and the fugitive slave has his         conceal'd hut;)O the strange fascination of these half-known, half-          impassable swamps, infested by reptiles, resound-          ing with the bellow of the alligator, the sad         noises of the night-owl and the wild cat, and the         whirr of the rattlesnake;The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the         forenoon—singing through the moon-lit night,The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the         opossum;A Tennessee corn-field—the tall, graceful, long-leav'd         corn—slender, flapping, bright green, with tas-          sels—with beautiful ears, each well-sheath'd in         its husk;An Arkansas prairie—a sleeping lake, or still bayou;O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs—I can stand         them not—I will depart;O to be a Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a Caro-          linian!O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Ten-          nessee, and never wander more! THINK OF THE SOUL.1 
          THINK of the Soul;I swear to you that body of yours gives proportions to         your Soul somehow to live in other spheres;I do not know how, but I know it is so.2 
          Think of loving and being loved;I swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse your-          self with such things that everybody that sees         you shall look longingly upon you.3 
          Think of the past;I warn you that in a little while others will find their         past in you and your times.4 
          The race is never separated—nor man nor woman         escapes;All is inextricable—things, spirits, Nature, nations, you         too—from precedents you come.5 
          Recall the ever-welcome defiers, (The mothers pre-          cede them;)Recall the sages, poets, saviors, inventors, lawgivers, of         the earth;Recall Christ, brother of rejected persons—brother of         slaves, felons, idiots, and of insane and diseas'd         persons.6 
          Think of the time when you were not yet born;Think of times you stood at the side of the dying;Think of the time when your own body will be dying.7 
          Think of spiritual results,Sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every         one of its objects pass into spiritual results.8 
          Think of manhood, and you to be a man;Do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood,         nothing?9 
          

 Think of womanhood, and you to be a woman;The creation is womanhood;Have I not said that womanhood involves all?Have I not told how the universe has nothing better         than the best womanhood? You Felons on Trial in Courts.1 
          YOU felons on trial in courts;You convicts in prison-cells—you sentenced assassins,         chain'd and hand-cuff'd with iron;Who am I, too, that I am not on trial, or in prison?Me, ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not         chain'd with iron, or my ankles with iron?2 
          You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs, or ob-          scene in your rooms,Who am I, that I should call you more obscene than         myself?3 
          O culpable!I acknowledge—I exposé!(O admirers! praise not me! compliment not me! you         make me wince,I see what you do not—I know what you do not.)4 
          Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch'd and choked;Beneath this face that appears so impassive, hell's tides         continually run;Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me;I walk with delinquents with passionate love;I feel I am of them—I belong to those convicts and         prostitutes myself,And henceforth I will not deny them—for how can I         deny myself? To a Common Prostitute.1 
          BE composed—be at ease with me—I am Walt Whit-          man, liberal and lusty as Nature;Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you;Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you, and the         leaves to rustle for you, do my words refuse to         glisten and rustle for you.2 
          My girl, I appoint with you an appointment—and I         charge you that you make preparation to be         worthy to meet me,And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I         come.3 
          Till then, I salute you with a significant look, that         you do not forget me. I was Looking a Long While.I WAS looking a long while for a clue to the history of         the past for myself, and for these chants—and         now I have found it;It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I         neither accept nor reject;)It is no more in the legends than in all else;It is in the present—it is this earth to-day;It is in Democracy—(the purport and aim of all the         past;)It is the life of one man or one woman to-day—the av-          erage man of to-day;It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts;It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, ma-          chinery, politics, creeds, modern improvements,         and the interchange of nations,All for the average man of to-day.  LEAVES OF GRASS. FACES11 
          SAUNTERING the pavement, or riding the country by-          road—lo! such faces!Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideal-          ity;The spiritual, prescient face—the always welcome, com-          mon, benevolent face,The face of the singing of music—the grand faces of         natural lawyers and judges, broad at the back-          top;The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the brows         —the shaved blanch'd faces of orthodox citi-          zens;The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's         face;The ugly face of some beautiful Soul, the handsome de-          tested or despised face;The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the         mother of many children;The face of an amour, the face of veneration;The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock;The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated         face;A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper;A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife         of the gelder.2 
          Sauntering the pavement, thus, or crossing the cease-          less ferry, faces, and faces, and faces:I see them, and complain not, and am content with all.23 
          Do you suppose I could be content with all, if I         thought them their own finale?4 
          This now is too lamentable a face for a man;Some abject louse, asking leave to be—cringing for it;Some milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to         its hole.5 
          This face is a dog's snout, sniffing for garbage;Snakes nest in that mouth—I hear the sibilant threat.6 
          This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea;Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.7 
          This is a face of bitter herbs—this an emetic—they         need no label;And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or         hog's-lard.8 
          This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out         the unearthly cry,Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they         show nothing but their whites,Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the         turn'd-in nails,The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground         while he speculates well.9 
          This face is bitten by vermin and worms,And this is some murderer's knife, with a half-pull'd         scabbard.10 
          This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee;An unceasing death-bell tolls there.311 
          Those then are really men—the bosses and tufts of         the great round globe!12 
          Features of my equals, would you trick me with your         creas'd and cadaverous march?Well, you cannot trick me.13 
          I see your rounded, never-erased flow;I see neath the rims of your haggard and mean dis-          guises.14 
          Splay and twist as you like—poke with the tangling         fores of fishes or rats;You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.15 
          I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering         idiot they had at the asylum;And I knew for my consolation what they knew not;I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my         brother,The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen ten-          ement;And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,And I shall meet the real landlord, perfect and un-          harm'd, every inch as good as myself.416 
          The Lord advances, and yet advances;Always the shadow in front—always the reach'd hand,         bringing up the laggards.17 
          Out of this face emerge banners and horses—O su-          perb! I see what is coming;I see the high pioneer-caps—I see the staves of runners         clearing the way,I hear victorious drums.18 
          This face is a life-boat;This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no         odds of the rest;This face is flavor'd fruit, ready for eating;This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of         all good.19 
          These faces bear testimony, slumbering or awake;They show their descent from the Master himself.20 
          Off the word I have spoken I except not one—red,         white, black, are all deific;In each house is the ovum—it comes forth after a thou-          sand years.21 
          Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me;Tall and sufficient stand behind, and make signs to me;I read the promise, and patiently wait.22 
          This is a full-grown lily's face,She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden         pickets, Come here,  she blushingly cries— Come nigh to me, lim-            ber-hipp'd man,  Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,  Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,  Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and           shoulders .523 
          The old face of the mother of many children!Whist! I am fully content.24 
          Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry, and the         cat-brier under them.25 
          I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,I heard what the singers were singing so long.Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white         froth and the water-blue.26 
          Behold a woman!She looks out from her quaker cap—her face is clearer         and more beautiful than the sky.27 
          She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of         the farm-house,The sun just shines on her old white head.28 
          Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,Her grandsons raised the flax, and her granddaugh-         ters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.29 
          The melodious character of the earth,The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and         does not wish to go,The justified mother of men. MANHATTAN'S STREETS I SAUNTER'D, PONDERING.11 
          MANHATTAN'S streets I saunter'd, pondering,On time, space, reality—on such as these, and abreast         with them, prudence.22 
          After all, the last explanation remains to be made         about prudence;Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the pru-          dence that suits immortality.3 
          The Soul is of itself;All verges to it—all has reference to what ensues;All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence;Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects         him or her in a day, month, any part of the         direct life-time, or the hour of death, but the         same affects him or her onward afterward         through the indirect life-time.34 
          The indirect is just as much as the direct,The spirit receives from the body just as much as it         gives to the body, if not more.5 
          Not one word or deed—not venereal sore, discolor-          ation, privacy of the onanist, putridity of glut-          tons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,         betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution, but         has results beyond death, as really as before         death.46 
          Charity and personal force are the only investments         worth anything.7 
          No specification is necessary—all that a male or fe-          male does, that is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is         so much profit to him or her, in the unshake-         able order of the universe, and through the whole         scope of it, forever.58 
          Who has been wise, receives interest,Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, me-         chanic, literat, young, old, it is the same,The interest will come round—all will come round.9 
          Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will         forever affect, all of the past, and all of the         present, and all of the future,All the brave actions of war and peace,All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old,         sorrowful, young children, widows, the sick, and         to shunn'd persons,All furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves,All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks,         and saw others fill the seats of the boats,All offering of substance or life for the good old cause,         or for a friend's sake, or opinion's sake,All pains of enthusiasts, scoff'd at by their neighbors,All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of         mothers,All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unre-          corded,All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose         fragments we inherit,All the good of the dozens of ancient nations un-         known to us by name, date, location,All that was ever manfully begun, whether it suc-         ceeded or no,All suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the         divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of his great         hands;All that is well thought or said this day on any part         of the globe—or on any of the wandering stars,         or on any of the fix'd stars, by those there as         we are here;All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you,         whoever you are, or by any one;These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities         from which they sprang, or shall spring.610 
          Did you guess anything lived only its moment?The world does not so exist—no parts palpable or im-          palpable so exist;No consummation exists without being from some         long previous consummation—and that from some         other,Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit         nearer the beginning than any.711 
          Whatever satisfies Souls is true;Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of         Souls;Itself only finally satisfies the Soul;The Soul has that measureless pride which revolts from         every lesson but its own.812 
          Now I give you an inkling;Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks         abreast with time, space, reality,That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but         its own.13 
          What is prudence, is indivisible,Declines to separate one part of life from every part,Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous, or the         living from the dead,Matches every thought or act by its correlative,Knows no possible forgiveness, or deputed atonement,Knows that the young man who composedly peril'd         his life and lost it, has done exceedingly well         for himself, without doubt,That he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old         age in riches and ease, has probably achiev'd         nothing for himself worth mentioning;Knows that only that person has really learn'd, who         has learn'd to prefer results,Who favors Body and Soul the same,Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the         direct,Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither         hurries or avoids death. All is Truth.1 
          O ME, man of slack faith so long!Standing aloof—denying portions so long;Only aware to-day of compact, all-diffused truth;Discovering to-day there is no lie, or form of lie, and         can be none, but grows as inevitably upon itself         as the truth does upon itself,Or as any law of the earth, or any natural production         of the earth does.2 
          (This is curious, and may not be realized immediately         —But it must be realized;I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with         the rest,And that the universe does.)3 
          Where has fail'd a perfect return, indifferent of lies or         the truth?Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the         spirit of man? or in the meat and blood?4 
          Meditating among liars, and retreating sternly into         myself, I see that there are really no liars or lies         after all,And that nothing fails its perfect return—And that         what are called lies are perfect returns,And that each thing exactly represents itself, and what         has preceded it,And that the truth includes all, and is compact, just as         much as space is compact,And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of         the truth—but that all is truth without excep-          tion;And henceforth I will go celebrate anything I see or         am,And sing and laugh, and deny nothing.  MARCHES NOW THE WAR IS OVER. AS I SAT ALONE BY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE.11 
          As I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore,As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd,         and the dead that return no more,A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted         me; Chant me the poem,  it said,  that comes from the soul of           America—chant me the carol of victory;  And strike up the marches of Libertad—marches more           powerful yet;  And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of           Democracy .2 
          (Democracy—the destin'd conqueror—yet treacherous         lip-smiles everywhere,And Death and infidelity at every step.)23 
          A Nation announcing itself,I myself make the only growth by which I can be ap-          preciated,I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own         forms.4 
          A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;What we are, we are—nativity is answer enough to         objections;We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,We are executive in ourselves—We are sufficient in the         variety of ourselves,We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence         over the world;From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks         to scorn.5 
          Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are         beautiful or sinful in ourselves only.6 
          (O mother! O sisters dear!If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us;It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)37 
          Have you thought there could be but a single         Supreme?There can be any number of Supremes—One does not         countervail another, any more than one eyesight         countervails another, or one life countervails         another.8 
          All is eligible to all,All is for individuals—All is for you,No condition is prohibited—not God's, or any.9 
          All comes by the body—only health puts you rapport         with the universe.10 
          Produce great persons, the rest follows.411 
          America isolated I sing;I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands,         are so much poison in The States.12 
          (How dare such insects as we see assume to write         poems for America?For our victorious armies, and the offspring following         the armies?)13 
          Piety and conformity to them that like!Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your         lives!14 
          I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue,         questioning every one I meet;Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you         knew before?Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in         your nonsense?15 
          (With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of         many children!These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)16 
          O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever         been before!If you would be freer than all that has been before,         come listen to me.17 
          Fear grace—Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of         states and men.518 
          Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undi-          rected materials,America brings builders, and brings its own styles.19 
          The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done         their work, and pass'd to other spheres,A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have         done.20 
          America, curious toward foreign characters, stands         by its own at all hazards,Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound—initiates         the true use of precedents,Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have         produced under their forms,Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse         slowly borne from the house,Perceives that it waits a little while in the door—that         it was fittest for its days,That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-          shaped heir who approaches,And that he shall be fittest for his days.21 
          Any period, one nation must lead,One land must be the promise and reliance of the         future.22 
          These States are the amplest poem,Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of         nations,Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast         doings of the day and night,Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of         particulars,Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combative-          ness, the Soul loves,Here the flowing trains—here the crowds, equality,         diversity, the Soul loves.623 
          Land of lands, and bards to corroborate!Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his         west-bred face,To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both         mother's and father's,His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,Built of the common stock, having room for far and         near,Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this         land,Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its         neck with incomparable love,Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and de-          merits,Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars,         vocal in him,Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes—         Columbia, Niagara, Hudson, spending them-          selves lovingly in him,If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch,         he stretching with them north or south,Spanning between them, east and west, and touching         whatever is between them,Growths growing from him to offset the growth of         pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut,         hickory, cotton-wood, orange, magnolia,Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests         coated with northern transparent ice,Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, up-          land, prairie,Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those         of the fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and         eagle;His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to         good and evil,Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and         present times,Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red         aborigines,Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo         stature and muscle,The haughty defiance of the Year 1—war, peace, the         formation of the Constitution,The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the im-          migrants,The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and         always sure and impregnable,The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild         animals, hunters, trappers;Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, tem-          perature, the gestation of new States,Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the mem-          bers duly coming up from the uttermost parts;Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and         farmers, especially the young men,Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships—         the gait they have of persons who never knew         how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors,The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the         copiousness and decision of their phrenology,The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierce-          ness when wrong'd,The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their         curiosity, good temper, and open-handedness—         the whole composite make,The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amative-          ness,The perfect equality of the female with the male, the         fluid movement of the population,The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling,         gold-digging,Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, in-          tersecting all points,Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the         north-east, north-west, south-west,Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern planta-          tion life,Slavery—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise         it upon the ruins of all the rest;On and on to the grapple with it—Assassin! then your         life or ours be the stake—and respite no more.724 
          (Lo! high toward heaven, this day,Libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd,I mark the new aureola around your head;No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,With war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,And your port immovable where you stand;With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd         and lifted fist,And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the         scorner, utterly crush'd beneath you;The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced         with his senseless scorn, bearing the murderous         knife;—Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would         yesterday do so much!To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all         the earth!An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.)825 
          Others take finish, but the Republic is ever construc-          tive, and ever keeps vista;Others adorn the past—but you, O days of the present,         I adorn you!O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself         for your sake;O America, because you build for mankind, I build for         you!O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with         decision and science,I lead the present with friendly hand toward the fu-          ture.26 
          Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the         next age!But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of         the stain, pains, dismay, feebleness, it is be-          queathing.927 
          I listened to the Phantom on Ontario's shore,I heard the voice arising, demanding bards;By them all native and grand—by them alone can The         States be fused into the compact organism of a         Nation.28 
          To hold men together by paper and seal, or by com-          pulsion, is no account;That only holds men together which aggregates all in a         living principle, as the hold of the limbs of the         body, or the fibres of plants.29 
          Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of         poetical stuff, most need poets, and are to have         the greatest, and use them the greatest;Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so         much as their poets shall.30 
          Soul of love, and tongue of fire!Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!—Ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides—yet how         long barren, barren?)1031 
          Of These States, the poet is the equable man,Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque,         eccentric, fail of their full returns,Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is         bad,He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion,         neither more nor less,He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,He is the equalizer of his age and land,He supplies what wants supplying—he checks what         wants checking,In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large,         rich, thrifty, building populous towns, encour-          aging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the         study of man, the Soul, health, immortality, gov-          ernment;In war, he is the best backer of the war—he fetches         artillery as good as the engineer's—he can make         every word he speaks draw blood;The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by         his steady faith,He is no arguer, he is judgment—(Nature accepts him         absolutely;)He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun fall-         ing round a helpless thing;As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and         denouement,He sees eternity in men and women—he does not see         men and women as dreams or dots.32 
          For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free indi-          viduals,For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of         leaders,The attitude of him cheers up slaves, and horrifies         foreign despots.33 
          Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is         Equality!They live in the feelings of young men, and the best         women;Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth         been always ready to fall for Liberty.1134 
          For the great Idea!That, O my brethren—that is the mission of Poets.35 
          Songs of stern defiance, ever ready,Songs of the rapid arming, and the march,The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we         know,Warlike flag of the great Idea.36 
          (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight         —O the hard-contested fight!O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the         hurtled balls scream!The battle-front forms amid the smoke—the volleys         pour incessant from the line;Hark! the ringing word,  Charge! —now the tussle, and         the furious maddening yells;Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)1237 
          Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be         a poet here in The States?The place is August—the terms obdurate.38 
          Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare         himself, body and mind,He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make         lithe, himself,He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with         many and stern questions.39 
          Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to         America?Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics,         geography, pride, freedom, friendship, of the         land? its substratums and objects?Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day         of the first year of Independence, sign'd by the         Commissioners, ratified by The States, and         read by Washington at the head of the army?Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution?Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems         behind them, and assumed the poems and pro-          cesses of Democracy?Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land         and sea, the bodies of men, womanhood, ama-         tiveness, angers, teach?Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies,         whirls, fierce contentions? are you very strong?         are you really of the whole people?Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere         religion?Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? ani-          mating now to life itself?Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These         States?Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and im-         partiality?Do you hold the like love for those hardening to ma-          turity; for the last-born? little and big? and         for the errant?40 
          What is this you bring my America?Is it uniform with my country?Is it not something that has been better told or done         before?Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some         ship?Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the         good old cause in it?Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, poli         ticians, literats, of enemies' lands?Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still         here?Does it answer universal needs? will it improve man-          ners?Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of         the Union, in that secession war?Can your performance face the open fields and the sea-          side?Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air—to appear         again in my strength, gait, face?Have real employments contributed to it? original         makers—not mere amanuenses?Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, faces, face to         face?What does it mean to me? to American persons, pro-          gresses, cities? Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the         planter, Yankee, Georgian, native, immigrant,         sailors, squatters, old States, new States?Does it encompass all The States, and the unexcep-         tional rights of all the men and woman of the         earth? (the genital impulse of These States;)Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real         custodians, standing, menacing, silent—the me-         chanics, Manhattanese, western men, southerners,         significant alike in their apathy, and in the         promptness of their love?Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally         befallen, each temporizer, patcher, outsider, par-          tialist, alarmist, infidel, who has ever ask'd any-          thing of America?What mocking and scornful negligence?The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.1341 
          Rhymes and rhymers pass away—poems distill'd         from foreign poems pass away,The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave         ashes;Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the         soil of literature;America justifies itself, give it time—no disguise can         deceive it, or conceal from it—it is impassive         enough,Only towards the likes of itself will it advance to meet         them,If its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet         them—there is no fear of mistake,(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his         country absorbs him as affectionately as he has         absorb'd it.)42 
          He masters whose spirit masters—he tastes sweetest         who results sweetest in the long run;The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners,         engineering, an appropriate native grand-opera,         shipcraft, any craft, he or she is greatest who         contributes the greatest original practical ex-          ample.43 
          Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, ap-          pears on the streets,People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive         knowers;There will shortly be no more priests—I say their work         is done.Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpet-         ual emergencies here,Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death         you shall be superb;Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresist-          ible power;How dare you place anything before a man?1444 
          Fall behind me, States!A man before all—myself, typical, before all.45 
          Give me the pay I have served for!Give me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all         the rest;I have loved the earth, sun, animals—I have despised         riches,I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for         the stupid and crazy, devoted my income and         labor to others,I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had         patience and indulgence toward the people,         taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown,I have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons,         and with the young, and with the mothers of         families,I have read these leaves to myself in the open air—I         have tried them by trees, stars, rivers,I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or         defiled my Body,I have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not         carefully claim'd for others on the same terms,I have sped to the camps, and comrades found and         accepted from every State;(In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, Amer-          ica—sadly I boast;Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to         breathe his last;This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd,         restored,To life recalling many a prostrate form:)—I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth         of the taste of myself,I reject none, I permit all.46 
          (Say, O mother! have I not to your thought been         faithful?Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before         me?)1547 
          I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things!It is not the earth, it is not America, who is so great,It is I who am great, or to be great—it is you up there,         or any one;It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments,         theories,Through poems, pageants, shows, to form great indi-          viduals.48 
          Underneath all, individuals!I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores indi-          viduals,The American compact is altogether with individuals,The only government is that which makes minute of         individuals,The whole theory of the universe is directed to one         single individual—namely, to You.49 
          (Mother! with subtle sense severe—with the naked         sword in your hand,I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with indi-          viduals.)1650 
          Underneath all, nativity,I swear I will stand by my own nativity—pious or im-          pious, so be it;I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from         nativity.51 
          Underneath all is the need of the expression of love         for men and women,I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent         modes of expressing love for men and women,After this day I take my own modes of expressing love         for men and women.52 
          I swear I will have each quality of my race in my-          self,(Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose         manners favor the audacity and sublime turbu-          lence of The States.)53 
          Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature,         governments, ownerships, I swear I perceive         other lessons,Underneath all, to me is myself—to you, yourself—(the         same monotonous old song.)1754 
          O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you         and me,Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and meIts crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and         me,Its Congress is you and me—the officers, capitols, ar-          mies, ships, are you and me,Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,The war—that war so bloody and grim—the war I will         henceforth forget—was you and me,Natural and artificial are you and me,Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and         me,Past, present, future, are you and me.1855 
          I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself,Not any part of America, good or bad,Not the promulgation of Liberty—not to cheer up slaves         and horrify foreign despots,Not to build for that which builds for mankind,Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the         sexes,Not to justify science, nor the march of equality,Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved         of time.56 
          I swear I am for those that have never been mas-          ter'd!For men and women whose tempers have never been         master'd,For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never         master.57 
          I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the         whole earth!Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all.58 
          I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things!I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon         me!I will make cities and civilizations defer to me!This is what I have learnt from America—it is the         amount—and it I teach again.59 
          (Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd         at your breast,I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children—         saw in dreams your dilating form;Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)1960 
          I will confront these shows of the day and night!I will know if I am to be less than they!I will see if I am not as majestic as they!I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they!I will see if I am to be less generous than they!61 
          I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and         ships have meaning!I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for         themselves, and I am not to be enough for my-          self.2062 
          I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths,         mountains, brutes,Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and be-          come the master myself.63 
          America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally         except myself?These States—what are they except myself?64 
          I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing,         wicked—it is for my sake,I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude         forms.65 
          (Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments         are for;I know not fruition's success—but I know that through         war and peace your work goes on, and must yet         go on.)2166 
          ………Thus, by blue Ontario's shore,While the winds fann'd me, and the waves came troop-          ing toward me,I thrill'd with the Power's pulsations—and the charm         of my theme was upon me,Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon         me.67 
          And I saw the free Souls of poets;The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were         disclosed to me.2268 
          O my rapt verse, my call—mock me not!Not for the bards of the past—not to invoke them have         I launch'd you forth,Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's         shores,Have I sung, so capricious and loud, my savage song.69 
          Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;(For the war, the war is over—the field is clear'd,)Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and         onward,To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul.70 
          Bards grand as these days so grand!Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inven-          tions! (for the war, the war is over!)Yet Bards of the latent armies—a million soldiers wait-          ing ever-ready,Bards towering like hills—(no more these dots, these         pigmies, these little piping straws, these gnats,         that fill the hour, to pass for poets;)Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the light-          ning's fork'd stripes!Ample Ohio's bards—bards for California! inland         bards—bards of the war;)(As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turn-          ing finally on the war;)Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean's roar, and         the swooping eagle's scream!You, by my charm, I invoke! PIONEERS! O PIONEERS!1COME, my tan-faced children,Follow well in order, get your weapons ready;Have you your pistols? have you your sharp edged         axes?Pioneers! O pioneers!2For we cannot tarry here,We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt         of danger,We, the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,         Pioneers! O pioneers!3O you youths, western youths,So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and         friendship,Plain I see you, western youths, see you tramping with         the foremost,Pioneers! O pioneers!4Have the elder races halted?Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied, over there         beyond the seas?We take up the task eternal, and the burden, and the         lesson,Pioneers! O pioneers!5All the past we leave behind;We debouch upon a newer, mightier world, varied         world;Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and         the march,Pioneers! O pioneers!6We detachments steady throwing,Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains         steep,Conquering, holding, daring, venturing, as we go, the         unknown ways,Pioneers! O pioneers!7We primeval forests felling,We the rivers stemming, vexing we, and piercing deep         the mines within;We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil up-          heaving,Pioneers! O pioneers!8Colorado men are we,From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the         high plateaus,From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting         trail we come,Pioneers! O pioneers!9From Nebraska, from Arkansas,Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the         continental blood intervein'd;All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern,         all the Northern,Pioneers! O pioneers!10O resistless, restless race!O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender         love for all!O I mourn and yet exult—I am rapt with love for all,Pioneers! O pioneers!11Raise the mighty mother mistress,Waving high the delicate mistress, over all the starry         mistress, (bend your heads all,)Raise the fang'd and warlike mistress, stern, impassive,         weapon'd mistress,Pioneers! O pioneers!12See, my children, resolute children,By those swarms upon our rear, we must never yield or         falter,Ages back in ghostly millions, frowning there behind us         urging,Pioneers! O pioneers!13On and on, the compact ranks,With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the         dead quickly fill'd,Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and         never stopping,Pioneers! O pioneers!14O to die advancing on!Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour         come?Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the         gap is fill'd,Pioneers! O pioneers!15All the pulses of the world,Falling in, they beat for us, with the western move-          ment beat;Holding single or together, steady moving, to the front,         all for us,Pioneers! O pioneers!16Life's involv'd and varied pageants,All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their         work,All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with         their slaves,Pioneers! O pioneers!17All the hapless silent lovers,All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and         the wicked,All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the         dying,Pioneers! O pioneers!18I too with my soul and body,We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,Through these shores, amid the shadows, with the ap-          paritions pressing,Pioneers! O pioneers!19Lo! the darting bowling orb!Lo! the brother orbs around! all the clustering suns         and planets;All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,Pioneers! O pioneers!20These are of us, they are with us,All for primal needed work, while the followers there         in embryo wait behind,We to-day's procession heading, we the route for travel         clearing,Pioneers! O pioneers!21O you daughters of the west!O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and         you wives!Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move         united,Pioneers! O pioneers!22Minstrels latent on the prairies!(Shrouded bards of other lands! you may sleep—you         have done your work;)Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and         tramp amid us,Pioneers! O pioneers!23Not for delectations sweet;Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and         the studious;Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame en-          joyment,Pioneers! O pioneers!24Do the feasters gluttonous feast?Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and         bolted doors?Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the         ground,Pioneers! O pioneers?25Has the night descended?Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discour-          aged, nodding on our way?Yet a passing hour I yield you, in your tracks to pause         oblivious,Pioneers! O pioneers!26Till with sound of trumpet,Far, far off the day-break call—hark! how loud and         clear I hear it wind;Swift! to the head of the army!—swift! spring to your         places,Pioneers! O pioneers! RESPONDEZ!RESPONDEZ! Respondez!(The war is completed—the price is paid—the title is         settled beyond recall;)Let every one answer! let those who sleep be waked!         let none evade!Must we still go on with our affectations and sneaking?Let me bring this to a close—I pronounce openly for         a new distribution of roles;Let that which stood in front go behind! and let that         which was behind advance to the front and         speak;Let murderers, bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new         propositions!Let the old propositions be postponed!Let faces and theories be turn'd inside out! let mean-          ings be freely criminal, as well as results!Let there be no suggestion above the suggestion of         drudgery!Let none be pointed toward his destination! (Say! do         you know your destination?)Let men and women be mock'd with bodies and mock'd         with Souls!Let the love that waits in them, wait! let it die, or pass         still-born to other spheres!Let the sympathy that waits in every man, wait! or let         it also pass, a dwarf, to other spheres!Let contradictions prevail! let one thing contradict         another! and let one line of my poems contra-          dict another!Let the people sprawl with yearning, aimless hands!         let their tongues be broken! let their eyes be         discouraged! let none descend into their hearts         with the fresh lusciousness of love!(Stifled, O days! O lands! in every public and private         corruption!Smother'd in thievery, impotence, shamelessness, moun-          tain-high;Brazen effrontery, scheming, rolling like ocean's waves         around and upon you, O my days! my lands!For not even those thunderstorms, nor fiercest light-          nings of the war, have purified the atmosphere;)—Let the theory of America still be management, caste,         comparison! (Say! what other theory would         you?)Let them that distrust birth and death still lead the         rest! (Say! why shall they not lead you?)Let the crust of hell be near'd and trod on! let the         days be darker than the nights! let slumber bring         less slumber than waking time brings!Let the world never appear to him or her for whom it         was all made!Let the heart of the young man still exile itself from         the heart of the old man! and let the heart of         the old man be exiled from that of the young         man!Let the sun and moon go! let scenery take the applause         of the audience! let there be apathy under the         stars!Let freedom prove no man's inalienable right! every         one who can tyrannize, let him tyrannize to his         satisfaction!Let none but infidels be countenanced!Let the eminence of meanness, treachery, sarcasm, hate,         greed, indecency, impotence, lust, be taken for         granted above all! let writers, judges, govern-          ments, households, religions, philosophies, take         such for granted above all!Let the worst men beget children out of the worst         women!Let the priest still play at immortality!Let death be inaugurated!Let nothing remain but the ashes of teachers, artists;         moralists, lawyers, and learn'd and polite per-          sons!Let him who is without my poems be assassinated!Let the cow, the horse, the camel, the garden-bee—let         the mud-fish, the lobster, the mussel, eel, the         sting-ray, and the grunting pig-fish—let these,         and the like of these, be put on a perfect equality         with man and woman!Let churches accommodate serpents, vermin, and the         corpses of those who have died of the most         filty of diseases!Let marriage slip down among fools, and be for none         but fools!Let men among themselves talk and think forever ob-          scencly of women! and let women among them-          selves talk and think obscenely of men!Let us all, without missing one, be exposed in public,         naked, monthly, at the peril of our lives! let         our bodies be freely handled and examined by         whoever chooses!Let nothing but copies at second hand be permitted to         exist upon the earth!Let the earth desert God, nor let there ever henceforth         be mention'd the name of God!Let there be no God!Let there be money, business, imports, exports, custom,         authority, precedents, pallor, dyspepsia, smut,         ignorance, unbelief!Let judges and criminals be transposed! let the prison-          keepers be put in prison! let those that were         prisoners take the keys! (Say! why might they         not just as well be transposed?)Let the slaves be masters! let the masters become slaves!Let the reformers descend from the stands where they         are forever bawling! let an idiot or insane         person appear on each of the stands!Let the Asiatic, the African, the European, the Ameri-         can, and the Australian, go armed against the         murderous stealthiness of each other! let them         sleep armed! let none believe in good will!Let there be no unfashionable wisdom! let such be         scorn'd and derided off from the earth!Let a floating cloud in the sky—let a wave of the sea—         let growing mint, spinach, onions, tomatoes—         let these be exhibited as shows, at a great price for         admission!Let all the men of These States stand aside for a few         smouchers! let the few seize on what they         choose! let the rest gawk, giggle, starve, obey!Let shadows be furnish'd with genitals! let substances         be deprived of their genitals!Let there be wealthy and immense cities—but still         through any of them, not a single poet, savior,         knower, lover!Let the infidels of These States laugh all faith away!If one man be found who has faith, let the rest set upon         him!Let them affright faith! let them destroy the power of         breeding faith!Let the she-harlots and the he-harlots be prudent! let         them dance on, while seeming lasts! (O seeming!         seeming! seeming!)Let the preachers recite creeds! let them still teach         only what they have been taught!Let insanity still have charge of sanity!Let books take the place of trees, animals, rivers, clouds!Let the daub'd portraits of heroes supersede heroes!Let the manhood of man never take steps after itself!Let it take steps after eunuchs, and after consumptive         and genteel persons!Let the white person again tread the black person         under his heel! (Say! which is trodden under         heel after all?)Let the reflections of the things of the world be studied         in mirrors! let the things themselves still con-          tinue unstudied!Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself!Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in         herself!(What real happiness have you had one single hour         through your whole life?)Let the limited years of life do nothing for the limitless         years of death! (What do you suppose death         will do, then?) TURN, O LIBERTAD.TURN, O Libertad, for the war is over,(From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no         more, resolute, sweeping the world,)Turn from lands retrospective, recording proofs of the         past;From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the         past;From the chants of the feudal world—the triumphs of         kings, slavery, caste;Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come—         give up that backward world;Leave to the singers of hitherto—give them the trailing         past;But what remains, remains for singers for you—wars         to come are for you;(Lo! how the wars of the past have duly inured to you         —and the wars of the present also inure:)—Then turn, and be not alarm'd, O Libertad—turn         your undying face,To where the future, greater than all the past,Is swiftly, surely preparing for you. ADIEU TO A SOLDIER.1 
          ADIEU, O soldier!You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)The rapid march, the life of the camp,The hot contention of opposing fronts—the long         manuver,Red battles with their slaughter,—the stimulus—the         strong, terrific game,Spell of all brave and manly hearts—the trains of Time         through you, and like of you, all fill'd,With war, and war's expression.2 
          Adieu, dear comrade!Your mission is fulfill'd—but I, more warlike,Myself, and this contentious soul of mine,Still on our own compaigning bound,Through untried roads, with ambushes, opponents         lined,Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis—often         baffled,Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out—         aye here,To fiercer, weightier battles give expression. As I Walk These Broad, Majestic Days.1 
          As I walk these broad, majestic days of peace,(For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O         terrific Ideal!Against vast odds, having gloriously won,Now thou stridest on—yet perhaps in time toward         denser wars,Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful con-          tests, dangers,Longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all others;)—As I walk, solitary, unattended,Around me I hear that eclat of the world—politics,         produce,The announcements of recognized things—science,The approved growth of cities, and the spread of inven-          tions.2 
          I see the ships (they will last a few years,)The vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,And hear the endorsement of all, and do not object to         it.3 
          But I too announce solid things;Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing         —I watch them,Like a grand procession, to music of distant bugles,         pouring, triumphantly moving—and grander         heaving in sight;They stand for realities—all is as it should be.4 
          Then my realities;What else is so real as mine?Libertad, and the divine average—Freedom to every         slave on the face of the earth,The rapt promises and lumin of seers—the spiritual         world—these centuries-lasting songs,And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid         announcements of any.5 
          For we support all, fuse all,After the rest is done and gone, we remain;There is no final reliance but upon us;Democracy rests finally upon us, (I, my brethren, be-          gin it,)And our visions sweep through eternity. WEAVE IN, WEAVE IN, MY HARDY LIFE.WEAVE in! weave in, my hardy life!Weave yet a soldier strong and full, for great campaigns         to come;Weave in red blood; weave sinews in, like ropes! the         senses, sight weave in!Weave lasting sure! weave day and night the weft, the         warp, incessant weave! tire not!(We know not what the use, O life! nor know the aim,         the end—nor really aught we know;But know the work, the need goes on, and shall go on—         the death-envelop'd march of peace as well as         war goes on;)For great campaigns of peace the same, the wiry threads         to weave;We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave.  LEAVES OF GRASS. THIS COMPOST.11 
          SOMETHING startles me where I thought I was safest;I withdraw from the still woods I loved;I will not go now on the pastures to walk;I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my         lover the sea;I will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh,         to renew me.2 
          O how can it be that the ground does not sicken?How can you be alive, you growths of spring?How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots,         orchards, grain?Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses         within you?Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour         dead?3 
          Where have you disposed of their carcasses?Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations;Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat;I do not see any of it upon you to-day—or perhaps I am         deceiv'd;I will run a furrow with my plough—I will press my         spade through the sod, and turn it up under-          neath;I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.24 
          Behold this compost! behold it well!Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick per-         son—Yet behold!The grass of spring covers the prairies,The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the         garden,The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage         out of its graves,The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mul         berry-tree,The he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the         birds sit on their nests,The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,The new-born of animals appear—the calf is dropt from         the cow, the colt from the mare,Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark         green leaves,Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk—the lilacs         bloom in the door-yards;The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above         all those strata of sour dead.5 
          What chemistry!That the winds are really not infectious,That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of         the sea, which is so amorous after me,That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over         with its tongues,That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have         deposited themselves in it,That all is clean forever and forever,That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,That the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-          orchard—that melons, grapes, peaches, plums,         will none of them poison me,That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any         disease,Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what         was once a catching disease.36 
          Now I am terrified at the Earth! it is that calm and         patient,It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such         endless successions of diseas'd corpses,It distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,It renews with such unwitting looks, its prodigal, an-          nual, sumptuous crops,It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such         leavings from them at last. UNNAMED LANDS.1 
          NATIONS ten thousand years before These States, and         many times ten thousand years before These         States;Garner'd clusters of ages, that men and women like us         grew up and travel'd their course, and pass'd on;What vast-built cities—what orderly republics—what         pastoral tribes and nomads;What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all         others;What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions;What sort of marriage—what costumes—what physi-          ology and phrenology;What of liberty and slavery among them—what they         thought of death and the soul;Who were witty and wise—who beautiful and poetic—         who brutish and undevelop'd;Not a mark, not a record remains—And yet all remains.2 
          O I know that those men and women were not for         nothing, any more than we are for nothing;I know that they belong to the scheme of the world         every bit as much as we now belong to it, and as         all will henceforth belong to it.3 
          Afar they stand—yet near to me they stand,Some with oval countenances, learn'd and calm,Some naked and savage—Some like huge collections of         insects,Some in tents—herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,Some prowling through woods—Some living peaceably         on farms, laboring, reaping, filling barns,Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces,         factories, libraries, shows, courts, theatres, won-          derful monuments.4 
          Are those billions of men really gone?Are those women of the old experience of the earth         gone?Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?Did they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?5 
          I believe of all those billions of men and women that         fill'd the unnamed lands; every one exists this         hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to us, in exact         proportion to what he or she grew from in life,         and out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved,         sinn'd, in life.6 
          I believe that was not the end of those nations, or any         person of them, any more than this shall be the         end of my nation, or of me;Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature,         products, games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons,         slaves, heroes, poets, I suspect their results         curiously await in the yet unseen world—coun-          terparts of what accrued to them in the seen         world,I suspect I shall meet them there,I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those         unnamed lands. MANNAHATTA.1 
          I WAS asking for something specific and perfect for         my city,Whereupon, lo! upsprang the aboriginal name!2 
          Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid,         sane, unruly, musical, self-sufficient;I see that the word of my city is that word up there,Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays,         superb, with tall and wonderful spires,Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and         steamships—an island sixteen miles long, solid-          founded,Numberless crowded streets—high growths of iron,         slender, strong, light, splendidly uprising to-         ward clear skies,Tides swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sun-          down,The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger ad-          joining islands, the heights, the villas,The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the light-          ers, the ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers, well-          model'd;The down-town streets, the jobbers' houses of business         —the houses of business of the ship-merchants,         and money-brokers—the river-streets;Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a         week;The carts hauling goods—the manly race of drivers of         horses—the brown-faced sailors;The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sail-          ing clouds aloft;The winter snows, the sleigh-bells—the broken ice in         the river, passing along, up or down, with the         flood-tide or ebb-tide;The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form'd,         beautiful-faced, looking you straight in the eyes;Trottoirs throng'd—vehicles—Broadway—the women—         the shops and shows,The parades, processions, bugles playing, flags flying,         drums beating;A million people—manners free and superb—open         voices—hospitality—the most courageous and         friendly young men;The free city! no slaves! no owners of slaves!The beautiful city, the city of hurried and sparkling         waters! the city of spires and masts!The city nested in bays! my city!The city of such women, I am mad to be with them!         I will return after death to be with them!The city of such young men, I swear I cannot live         happy, without I often go talk, walk, eat, drink,         sleep, with them! OLD IRELAND.1 
          FAR hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,Crouching over a grave, an ancient sorrowful mother,Once a queen—now lean and tatter'd, seated on the         ground,Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoul-          ders;At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,Long silent—she too long silent—mourning her shroud-         ed hope and heir;Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because         most full of love.2 
          Yet a word, ancient mother;You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground,         with forehead between your knees;O you need not sit there, veil'd in your old white hair,         so dishevel'd;For know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave;It was an illusion—the heir, the son you love, was not         really dead;The Lord is not dead—he is risen again, young and         strong, in another country;Even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the         grave,What you wept for, was translated, pass'd from the         grave,The winds favor'd, and the sea sail'd it,And now with rosy and new blood,Moves to-day in a new country. To ORATISTS.1 
          TO ORATISTS—to male or female,Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and         the divine power to use words.2 
          Are you full-lung'd and limber-lipp'd from long trial?         from vigorous practice? from physique?Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?Come duly to the divine power to use words?3 
          For only at last, after many years—after chastity,         friendship, procreation, prudence, and nakedness;After treading ground and breasting river and lake;After a loosen'd throat—after absorbing eras, tempera-          ments, races—after knowledge, freedom, crimes;After complete faith—after clarifyings, elevations, and         removing obstructions;After these, and more, it is just possible there comes to         a man, a woman, the divine power to use words.4 
          Then toward that man or that woman, swiftly hasten         all—None refuse, all attend;Armies, ships, antiquities, the dead, libraries, paintings,         machines, cities, hate, despair, amity, pain, theft,         murder, aspiration, form in close ranks;  BATHED IN WAR'S PERFUME. BATHED IN WAR'S PERFUME.BATHED in war's perfume—delicate flag!(Should the days needing armies, needing fleets, come         again,)O to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers! flag like         a beautiful woman!O to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering         men! O the ships they arm with joy!O to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of         ships!O to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks!Flag like the eyes of women. DELICATE CLUSTER.DELICATE cluster! flag of teeming life!Covering all my lands! all my sea-shores lining!Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke         of battle pressing!How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)Flag cerulean! sunny flag! with the orbs of night dap-          pled!Ah my silvery beauty! ah my woolly white and crim-          son!Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!My sacred one, my mother. SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAY-BREAK.POET.1 
          O A new song, a free song,Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by         voices clearer,By the wind's voice and that of the drum,By the banner's voice, and child's voice, and sea's voice,         and father's voice,Low on the ground and high in the air,On the ground where father and child stand,In the upward air where their eyes turn,Where the banner at day-break is flapping.2 
          Words! book-words! what are you?Words no more, for hearken and see,My song is there in the open air—and I must sing,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.3 
          I'll weave the cord and twine in,Man's desire and babe's desire—I'll twine them in, I'll         put in life;I'll put the bayonet's flashing point—I'll let bullets and         slugs whizz;(As one carrying a symbol and menace, far into the         future,Crying with trumpet voice,  Arouse and beware! Beware           and arouse! )I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of voli-         tion, full of joy;Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.PENNANT.4 
          Come up here, bard, bard;Come up here, soul, soul;Come up here, dear little child,To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with         the measureless light.CHILD.5 
          Father, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with         long finger?And what does it say to me all the while?FATHER.6 
          Nothing, my babe, you see in the sky;And nothing at all to you it says. But look you, my         babe,Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see         you the money-shops opening;And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the         streets with goods:These! ah, these! how valued and toil'd for, these!How envied by all the earth!POET.7 
          Fresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high;On floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its         channels;On floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in         toward land;The great steady wind from west and west-by-south,Floating so buoyant, with milk-white foam on the         waters.8 
          But I am not the sea, nor the red sun;I am not the wind with girlish laughter;Not the immense wind which strengthens—not the wind         which lashes;Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror         and death;But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings,         sings,Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the         land,Which the birds know in the woods, mornings and         evenings,And the shore-sands know, and the hissing wave, and         that banner and pennant,Aloft there flapping and flapping.CHILD.9 
          O father, it is alive—it is full of people—it has chil-          dren!O now it seems to me it is talking to its children!I hear it—it talks to me—O it is wonderful!O if stretches—it spreads and runs so fast! O my         father,It is so broad, it covers the whole sky!FATHER.10 
          Cease, cease, my foolish babe,What you are saying is sorrowful to me—much it dis-          pleases me;Behold with the rest, again I say—behold not banners         and pennants aloft;But the well-prepar'd pavements behold—and mark the         solid-wall'd houses.BANNER AND PENNANT.11 
          Speak to the child, O bard, out of Manhattan;(The war is over—yet never over….out of it, we are         born to real life and identity;)Speak to our children all, or north or south of Man-          hattan,Where our factory-engines hum, where our miners         delve the ground,Where our hoarse Niagara rumbles, where our prairie-          plows are plowing;Speak, O bard! point this day, leaving all the rest, to         us over all—and yet we know not why;For what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,Only flapping in the wind?POET.12 
          I hear and see not strips of cloth alone;I hear again the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging         sentry;I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men—I hear         LIBERTY!I hear the drums beat, and the trumpets yet blowing;I myself move abroad, swift-rising, flying then;I use the wings of the land-bird, and use the wings of         the sea-bird, and look down as from a height;I do not deny the precious results of peace—I see pop-          ulous cities, with wealth incalculable;I see numberless farms—I see the farmers working in         their fields or barns;I see mechanics working—I see buildings everywhere         founded, going up, or finish'd;I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad         tracks, drawn by the locomotives;I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charles-          ton, New Orleans;I see far in the west the immense area of grain—I         dwell awhile, hovering;I pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to         the southern plantation, and again to California;Sweeping the whole, I see the countless profit, the busy         gatherings, earned wages;See the identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and         haughty States, (and many more to come;)See forts on the shores of harbors—see ships sailing in         and out;Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd         pennant shaped like a sword,Runs swiftly up, indicating war and defiance—And now         the halyards have rais'd it,Side of my banner broad and blue—side of my starry         banner,Discarding peace over all the sea and land.BANNER AND PENNANT.13 
          Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider         cleave!No longer let our children deem us riches and peace         alone;We may be terror and carnage, and are so now;Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty         States, (nor any five, nor ten;)Nor market nor depot are we, nor money-bank in the         city;But these, and all, and the brown and spreading land,         and the mines below, are ours;And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great         and small;And the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops and         the fruits are ours;Bays and channels, and ships sailing in and out, are         ours—and we over all,Over the area spread below, the three or four millions         of square miles—the capitals,The forty millions of people—O bard! in life and death         supreme,We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up         above,Not for the present alone, for a thousand years, chant-          ing through you,This song to the soul of one poor little child.CHILD.14 
          O my father, I like not the houses;They will never to me be anything—nor do I like         money;But to mount up there I would like, O father dear—         that banner I like;That pennant I would be, and must be.FATHER.15 
          Child of mine, you fill me with anguish;To be that pennant would be too fearful;Little you know what it is this day, and after this day,         forever;It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything;Forward to stand in front of wars—and O, such wars;         —what have you to do with them?With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?POET.16 
          Demons and death then I sing;Put in all, aye all, will I—sword-shaped pennant for         war, and banner so broad and blue,And a pleasure new and extatic, and the prattled yearn-          ing of children,Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the         liquid wash of the sea;And the black ships, fighting on the sea, enveloped in         smoke;And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling         cedars and pines;And the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers         marching, and the hot sun shining south;And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my         eastern shore, and my western shore the same;And all between those shores, and my ever-running         Mississippi, with bends and chutes;And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my         fields of Missouri;The CONTINENT—devoting the whole identity, without         reserving an atom,Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all,         and the yield of all.BANNER AND PENNANT.17 
          Aye all! for ever, for all!From sea to sea, north and south, east and west,(The war is completed, the price is paid, the title is         settled beyond recall;)Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole;No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,But, out of the night emerging for good, our voice per-          suasive no more,Croaking like crows here in the wind.POET.( Finale .)18 
          My limbs, my veins dilate;The blood of the world has fill'd me full—my theme is         clear at last:—Banner so broad, advancing out of the night, I sing         you haughty and resolute;I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd         and blinded;My sight, my hearing and tongue, are come to me, (a         little child taught me;)I hear from above, O pennant of war, your ironical call         and demand;Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O         banner!Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all         their prosperity, (if need be, you shall again         have every one of those houses to destroy them;You thought not to destroy those valuable houses,         standing fast, full of comfort, built with money;May they stand fast, then? Not an hour, except you,         above them and all, stand fast;)—O banner! not money so precious are you, not farm         produce you, nor the material good nutriment,Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the         ships;Not the superb ships, with sail-power or steam-power,         fetching and carrying cargoes,Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,—But         you, as henceforth I see you,Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of         stars, (ever-enlarging stars;)Divider of day-break you, cutting the air, touch'd by         the sun, measuring the sky,(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little         child,While others remain busy, or smartly talking, forever         teaching thrift, thrift;)O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like         a snake, hissing so curious,Out of reach—an idea only—yet furiously fought for,         risking bloody death—loved by me!So loved! O you banner leading the day, with stars         brought from the night!Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all—         (absolute owner of ALL)—O banner and pennant!I too leave the rest—great as it is, it is nothing—houses,         machines are nothing—I see them not;I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad,         with stripes, I sing you only,Flapping up there in the wind. ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLORS.( A Reminiscence of  1864.)1WHO are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare         bony feet?Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors         greet?2('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sand and pines,Forth from thy hovel door, thou, Ethiopia, com'st to me,As, under doughty Sherman, I march toward the sea.)3 Me, master, years a hundred, since from my parents sun-           der'd,  A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught;  Then hither me, across the sea, the cruel slaver brought .4No further does she say, but lingering all the day,Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her         darkling eye,And curtseys to the regiments, the guidons moving by.5What is it, fateful woman—so blear, hardly human?Why wag your head, with turban bound—yellow, red         and green?Are the things so strange and marvelous, you see or         have seen? Lo! Victress on the Peaks!Lo! Victress on the peaks!Where thou, with mighty brow, regarding the world,(The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against         thee;)Out of its countless, beleaguering toils, after thwarting         them all;)Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,Flauntest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and         bloom—lo! in these hours supreme,No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee—nor mastery's         rapturous verse;But a book, containing night's darkness, and blood-          dripping wounds,And psalms of the dead. World, Take Good Notice.WORLD, take good notice, silver stars fading,Milky hue ript, weft of white detaching,Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores. 360 Germs.FORMS, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,The ones known, and the ones unknown—the ones on         the stars,The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,Wonders as of those countries—the soil, trees, cities,         inhabitants, whatever they may be,Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless com-          binations and effects;Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or any-          where, stand provided for in a handful of space,         which I extend my arm and half enclose with my         hand;That contains the start of each and all—the virtue, the         germs of all.  LEAVES OF GRASS. O ME! O LIFE!O ME! O life!…of the questions of these recurring;Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill'd with         the foolish;Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more         foolish than I, and who more faithless?)Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean         —of the struggle ever renew'd;Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid         crowds I see around me;Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the         rest me intertwined;The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good         amid these, O me, O life?Answer.That you are here—that life exists, and identity;That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute         a verse. THOUGHTS.OF Public Opinion;Of a calm and cool fiat, sooner or later, (How impas-         sive! How certain and final!)Of the President with pale face, asking secretly to him-          self,  What will the people say at last?   SONGS OF INSURRECTION. STILL THOUGH THE ONE I SING.STILL, though the one I sing,(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nation-          ality,I leave in him Revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O         quenchless, indispensable fire!) TO A FOIL'D EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONAIRE.11 
          COURAGE yet! my brother or my sister!Keep on! Liberty is to be subserv'd, whatever occurs;That is nothing, that is quell'd by one or two failures,         or any number of failures,Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or         by any unfaithfulness,Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon,         penal statutes.2 
          Revolt! and still revolt! revolt!What we believe in waits latent forever through all         the continents, and all the islands and archi-          pelagos of the sea;What we believe in invites no one, promises nothing,         sits in calmness and light, is positive and com-          posed, knows no discouragement,Waiting patiently, waiting its time.3 
          (Not songs of loyalty alone are these,But songs of insurrection also;For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel, the         world over,And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind         him,And stakes his life, to be lost at any moment.)24 
          Revolt! and the downfall of tyrants!The battle rages with many a loud alarm, and frequent         advance and retreat,The infidel triumphs—or supposes he triumphs,Then the prison, scaffold, garrote, hand-cuffs, iron neck-          lace and anklet, lead-balls, do their work,The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,The great speakers and writers are exiled—they lie sick         in distant lands,The cause is asleep—the strongest throats are still,         choked with their own blood,The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground         when they meet;—But for all this, liberty has not gone out of the place,         nor the infidel enter'd into full possession,5 
          When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to         go, nor the second or third to go,It waits for all the rest to go—it is the last.6 
          When there are no more memories of heroes and         martyrs,And when all life, and all the souls of men and women         are discharged from any part of the earth,Then only shall liberty, or the idea of liberty, be dis-          charged from that part of the earth,And the infidel come into full possession.37 
          Then courage! European revolter! revoltress!For, till all ceases, neither must you cease.8 
          I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what         I am for myself, nor what anything is for,)But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment—for         they too are great.9 
          Revolt! and the bullet for tyrants!Did we think victory great?So it is—But now it seems to me, when it cannot be         help'd, that defeat is great,And that death and dismay are great. FRANCE,The 18th Year of These States.11 
          A GREAT year and place;A harsh, discordant, natal scream out-sounding, to         touch the mother's heart closer than any yet.2 
          I walk'd the shores of my Eastern Sea,Heard over the waves the little voice,Saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wail-          ing, amid the roar of cannon, curses, shouts,         crash of falling buildings;Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running         —nor from the single corpses, nor those in heaps,         nor those borne away in the tumbrils;Was not so desperate at the battues of death—was not         so shock'd at the repeated fusillades of the guns.23 
          Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-          accrued retribution?Could I wish humanity different?Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?34 
          O Liberty! O mate for me!Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in re-          serve, to fetch them out in case of need;Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd;Here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic;Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.45 
          Hence I sign this salute over the sea,And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,But remember the little voice that I heard wailing—and         wait with perfect trust, no matter how long;And from to-day, sad and cogent, I maintain the be-          queath'd cause, as for all lands,And I send these words to Paris with my love,And I guess some chansonniers there will understand         them,For I guess there is latent music yet in France—floods         of it;O I hear already the bustle of instruments—they will         soon be drowning all that would interrupt them;O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free         march,It reaches hither—it swells me to joyful madness,I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,I will yet sing a song for you, MA FEMME. EUROPE,The 72d and 73d Years of These States.11 
          SUDDENLY, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of         slaves,Like lightning it le'pt forth, half startled at itself,Its feet upon the ashes and the rags—its hands tight to         the throats of kings.2 
          O hope and faith!O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!O many a sicken'd heart!Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.3 
          And you, paid to defile the People! you liars, mark!Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming         from his simplicity the poor man's wages,For many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken,         and laugh'd at in the breaking,Then in their power, not for all these, did the blows         strike revenge, or the heads of the nobles fall;The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings;24 
          But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction,         and the frighten'd monarchs come back;Each comes in state, with his train—hangman, priest,         tax-gatherer,Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.5 
          Yet behind all, lowering, stealing—lo, a Shape,Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front         and form, in scarlet folds,Whose face and eyes none may see,Out of its robes only this—the red robes, lifted by the         arm,One finger, crook'd, pointed high over the top, like the         head of a snake appears.36 
          Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves—bloody         corpses of young men,The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of         princes are flying, the creatures of power laugh         aloud,And all these things bear fruits—and they are good.7 
          Those corpses of young men,Those martrys that hang from the gibbets—those hearts         pierc'd by the gray lead,Cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with         unslaughter'd vitality.8 
          They live in other young men, O kings!They live in brothers, again ready to defy you!They were purified by death—they were taught and         exalted.9 
          Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom, but grows         seed for freedom, in its turn to bear seed,Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains         and the snows nourish.10 
          Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants         let loose,But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, coun-          seling, cautioning.411 
          Liberty! let others despair of you! I never despair         of you.12 
          Is the house shut? Is the master away?Nevertheless, be ready—be not weary of watching;He will soon return—his messengers come anon.  LEAVES OF GRASS. To You.1 
          WHOEVER you are, I fear you are walking the walks of         dreams,I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under         your feet and hands;Even now, your features, joys, speech, house, trade,         manners, troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissi-          pate away from you,Your true Soul and Body appear before me,They stand forth out of affairs—out of commerce, shops,         law, science, work, farms, clothes, the house,         medicine, print, buying, selling, eating, drinking,         suffering, dying.2 
          Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that         you be my poem;I whisper with my lips close to your ear,I have loved many women and men, but I love none         better than you.3 
          O I have been dilatory and dumb;I should have made my way straight to you long ago;I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have         chanted nothing but you.4 
          I will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you;None have understood you, but I understand you;None have done justice to you—you have not done         justice to yourself;None but have found you imperfect—I only find no         imperfection in you;None but would subordinate you—I only am he who         will never consent to subordinate you;I only am he who places over you no master, owner,         better, God, beyond what waits intrinsically in         yourself.5 
          Painters have painted their swarming groups, and the         centre figure of all;From the head of the centre figure spreading a nimbus         of gold-color'd light;But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head with-         out its nimbus of gold-color'd light;From my hand, from the brain of every man and woman         it streams, effulgently flowing forever.6 
          O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!You have not known what you are—you have slumber'd         upon yourself all your life;Your eye-lids have been the same as closed most of the         time;What you have done returns already in mockeries;Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return         in mockeries, what is their return?)7 
          The mockeries are not you;Underneath them, and within them, I see you lurk;I pursue you where none else has pursued you;Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the         accustom'd routine, if these conceal you from         others, or from yourself, they do not conceal you         from me;The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure com-          plexion, if these balk others, they do not balk         me,The pert apparel, the deform'd attitude, drunkenness,         greed, premature death, all these I part aside.8 
          There is no endowment in man or woman that is not         tallied in you;There is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as         good is in you;  SONGS OF PARTING. AS THE TIME DRAWS NIGH.11 
          As the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,A dread beyond, of I know not what, darkens me.2 
          I shall go forth,I shall traverse The States awhile—but I cannot tell         whither or how long;Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing,         my voice will suddenly cease.23 
          O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?…         And yet it is enough, O soul!O soul! we have positively appear'd—that is enough. YEARS OF THE MODERN.YEARS of the modern! years of the unperform'd!Your horizon rises—I see it parting away for more         august dramas;I see not America only—I see not only Liberty's nation,         but other nations preparing;I see tremendous entrances and exits—I see new com-          binations—I see the solidarity of races;I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the         world's stage;(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts?         are the acts suitable to them closed?)I see Freedom, completely arm'd, and victorious, and         very haughty, with Law on one side, and Peace         on the other,A stupendous Trio, all issuing forth against the idea of         caste;—What historic denouements are these we so rapidly         approach?I see men marching and countermarching by swift mil-          lions;I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies         broken;I see the landmarks of European kings removed;I see this day the People beginning their landmarks,         (all others give way;)—Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day;Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more         like a God;Lo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no         rest;His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere—he col-          onizes the Pacific, the archipelagoes;With the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the news-          paper, the wholesale engines of war,With these, and the world-spreading factories, he inter-          links all geography, all lands;—What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of         you, passing under the seas?Are all nations communing? is there going to be but         one heart to the globe?Is humanity forming, en-masse?—for lo! tyrants trem-          ble, crowns grow dim;The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a gen-         eral divine war;No one knows what will happen next—such portents         fill the days and nights;Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vain-          ly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms;Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes         around me;This incredible rush and heat—this strange extatic         fever of dreams, O years!Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me!         (I know not whether I sleep or wake!)The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring         in shadow behind me,The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, ad-          vance upon me. THOUGHTS.1OF these years I sing,How they pass and have pass'd, through convuls'd         pains, as through parturitions;How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the         promise, the sure fulfillment, the Absolute Suc-          cess, despite of people—Illustrates evil as well as         good;How many hold despairingly yet to the models de-          parted, caste, myths, obedience, compulsion, and         to infidelity;How few see the arrived models, the Athletes, the         Western States—or see freedom or spirituality—         or hold any faith in results,(But I see the Athletes—and I see the results of the war         glorious and inevitable—and they again leading         to other results;)How the great cities appear—How the Democratic         masses, turbulent, wilful, as I love them;How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with         good, the sounding and resounding, keep on         and on;How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between         things ended and things begun;How America is the continent of glories, and of the         triumph of freedom, and of the Democracies,         and of the fruits of society, and of all that is         begun;And how The States are complete in themselves—And         how all triumphs and glories are complete in         themselves, to lead onward,And how these of mine, and of The States, will in their         turn be convuls'd, and serve other parturitions         and transitions,And how all people, sights, combinations, the Demo-          cratic masses, too, serve—and how every fact,         and war itself, with all its horrors, serves,And how now, or at any time, each serves the exquisite         transition of death.2OF seeds dropping into the ground—of birth,Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward,         to impregnable and swarming places,Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and the rest, are to be,Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Col-          orado, Nevada, and the rest;(Of afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or         Aliaska;)Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for         —and of what all sights, North, South, East and         West, are;Of This Union, soak'd, welded in blood—of the solemn         price paid—of the unnamed lost, ever present in         my mind;—Of the temporary use of materials, for identity's sake,Of the present, passing, departing—of the growth of         completer men than any yet,Of myself, soon, perhaps, closing up my songs by these         shores,Of California, of Oregon—and of me journeying to live         and sing there;Of the Western Sea—of the spread inland between it         and the spinal river,Of the great pastoral area, athletic and feminine,Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver,         the mother, the Mississippi flows,Of future women there—of happiness in those high         plateaus, ranging three thousand miles, warm         and cold;Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd, and unsus-          pected, (as I am also, and as it must be;)Of the new and good names—of the modern develop-          ments—of inalienable homesteads;Of a free and original life there—of simple diet and         clean and sweet blood;Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect         physique there;Of immense spiritual results, future years, far west,         each side of the Anahuacs;Of these leaves, well understood there, (being made for         that area;)Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there;(O it lurks in me night and day—What is gain, after         all, to savageness and freedom?) Song at Sunset.1 
          SPLENDOR of ended day, floating and filling me!Hour prophetic—hour resuming the past!Inflating my throat—you, divine average!You, Earth and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.2 
          Open mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,Eyes of my Soul, seeing perfection,Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;Corroborating forever the triumph of things.3 
          Illustrious every one!Illustrious what we name space—sphere of unnum-          ber'd spirits;Illustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, even         the tiniest insect;Illustrious the attribute of speech—the senses—the         body;Illustrious the passing light! Illustrious the pale         reflection on the new moon in the western sky!Illustrious whatever I see, or hear, or touch, to the last.4 
          Good in all,In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,In the annual return of the seasons,In the hilarity of youth,In the strength and flush of manhood,In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,In the superb vistas of Death.5 
          Wonderful to depart;Wonderful to be here!The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood!To breathe the air, how delicious!To speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand!To prepare for sleep, for bed—to look on my rose-          color'd flesh;To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large;To be this incredible God I am;To have gone forth among other Gods—these men and         women I love.6 
          Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself!How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!How the clouds pass silently overhead!How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun,         moon, stars, dart on and on!How the water sports and sings! (Surely it is alive!)How the trees rise and stand up—with strong trunks—         with branches and leaves!(Surely there is something more in each of the trees—         some living Soul,)7 
          O amazement of things! even the least particle!O spirituality of things!O strain musical, flowing through ages and continents         —now reaching me and America!I take your strong chords—I intersperse them, and         cheerfully pass them forward.8 
          I too carol the sun, usher'd, or at noon, or, as now,         setting,I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and         of all the growths of the earth,I too have felt the resistless call of myself.9 
          As I sail'd down the Mississippi,As I wander'd over the prairies,As I have lived—As I have look'd through my windows,         my eyes,As I went forth in the morning—As I beheld the light         breaking in the east;As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again         on the beach of the Western Sea;As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago—whatever         streets I have roam'd;Or cities, or silent woods, or peace, or even amid the         sights of war;Wherever I have been, I have charged myself with con-          tentment and triumph.10 
          I sing the Equalities, modern or old,I sing the endless finales of things;I say Nature continues—Glory continues;I praise with electric voice;For I do not see one imperfection in the universe;And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last         in the universe.11 
          O setting sun! though the time has come,I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated         adoration. WHEN I HEARD THE LEARN'D ASTRONOMER.WHEN I heard the learn'd astronomer;When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns         before me;When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add,         divide, and measure them;When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lec-          tured with much applause in the lecture-room,How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick;Till rising and gliding out, I wander'd off by myself,In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars. TO RICH GIVERS.WHAT you give me, I cheerfully accept,A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money—         these, as I rendezvous with my poems;A traveler's lodging and breakfast as I journey through         The States—Why should I be ashamed to own         such gifts? Why to advertise for them?For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon         man and woman;For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to         all the gifts of the universe. THOUGHT.OF what I write from myself—As if that were not the         resumé;Of Histories—As if such, however complete, were not         less complete than the preceding poems;As if those shreds, the records of nations, could possibly         be as lasting as the preceding poems;As if here were not the amount of all nations, and of all         the lives of heroes. SO LONG!11 
          To conclude—I announce what comes after me;I announce mightier offspring, orators, days, and then,         for the present, depart.2 
          I remember I said, before my leaves sprang at all,I would raise my voice jocund and strong, with reference         to consummations.3 
          When America does what was promis'd,When there are plentiful athletic bards, inland and         seaboard,When through These States walk a hundred millions of         superb persons,When the rest part away for superb persons, and con-          tribute to them,When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote         America,Then to me and mine our due fruition.4 
          I have press'd through in my own right,I have sung the Body and the Soul—War and Peace         have I sung,And the songs of Life and of Birth—and shown that         there are many births:I have offer'd my style to every one—I have journey'd         with confident step;While my pleasure is yet at the full, I whisper,  So long! And take the young woman's hand, and the young         man's hand, for the last time.25 
          I announce natural persons to arise;I announce justice triumphant;I announce uncompromising liberty and equality;I announce the justification of candor, and the justifica-          tion of pride.6 
          I announce that the identity of These States is a         single identity only;I announce the Union more and more compact, indis-          soluble;I announce splendors and majesties to make all the         previous politics of the earth insignificant.7 
          I announce adhesiveness—I say it shall be limitless,         unloosen'd;I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.8 
          I announce a man or woman coming—perhaps you         are the one, ( So long! )I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste,         affectionate, compassionate, fully armed.9 
          I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement,         spiritual, bold;I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet         its translation;I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-          blooded;I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.310 
          O thicker and faster! ( So long! )O crowding too close upon me;I foresee too much—it means more than I thought;It appears to me I am dying.11 
          Hasten throat, and sound your last!Salute me—salute the days once more. Peal the old         cry once more.12 
          Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,At random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,Curious envelop'd messages delivering,Sparkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,Myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question         it never daring,To ages, and ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,To troops out of me, out of the army, the war arising—         they the tasks I have set promulging,To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing—         their affection me more clearly explaining,To young men my problems offering—no dallier I—I         the muscle of their brains trying,So I pass—a little time vocal, visible, contrary;Afterward, a melodious echo, passionately bent for—         (death making me really undying;)The best of me then when no longer visible—for toward         that I have been incessantly preparing.13 
          What is there more, that I lag and pause, and crouch         extended with unshut mouth?Is there a single final farewell?414 
          My songs cease—I abandon them;From behind the screen where I hid, I advance person-          ally, solely to you.15 
          Camerado! This is no book;Who touches this, touches a man;(Is it night? Are we here alone?)It is I you hold, and who holds you;I spring from the pages into your arms—decease calls         me forth.16 
          O how your fingers drowse me!Your breath falls around me like dew—your pulse lulls         the tympans of my ears;I feel immerged from head to foot;Delicious—enough.
