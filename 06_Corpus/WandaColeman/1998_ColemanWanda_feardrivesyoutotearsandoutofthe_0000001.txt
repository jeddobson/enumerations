1 fear drives you to tears and out of the 
2 house during arguments with Mama for long walks 3 
on sweltering summer eyes. the moths 4 come, collect on 
grainy stucco porches, are 5 hosed away at sunrise. you 
stare at 6 shaded windows, struggle to decipher the lives 
inside. 7 who are they? do they see you out 
here watching? 8 won't some sympathetic someone invite you in 
9 for tea? cars are being washed and turtle-waxed by 
10 loving hands. preteeners play dodgeball on 11 vacant lots. 
the librarian admonishes you for staying 12 so late and 
not having brought your card. palms nod 13 against the 
neon rainbow sky. the moths come. and 14 the starlings. 
and the dragonflies. you know 15 something important is going 
to happen. to you. 16 hurry, you whisper, please hurry
