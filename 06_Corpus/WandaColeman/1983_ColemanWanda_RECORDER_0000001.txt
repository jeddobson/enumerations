1 names. still quiet mouths 2 the dead sing hope 
pain/the body 3 warmth 4 i work among them 5 
my hands swift, move. much to be done 6 countless 
numbers of them ahead 7 looking back and looking forward 
8 smile to myself 9 girl, you know, don't you 
10 they paid out of their estates 11 billed for 
stilled breath 12 heritage of dust 13 filed under "T" 
14 today i work among the dead 15 sort them 
out, set them straight 16 arrange them in neat piles 
17 these silent numbers stare at me 18 across the 
manila distance 19 the hands of a cold absorbed god
