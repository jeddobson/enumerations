1 mid-nightmare, this warning from the slams arrives: 2 you 
have entered the creative sovereignty of an 3 infamous black 
postmodernist raptivist who will 4 not be held accountable for 
the rhythms of word 5 taking your mind hostage, demanding 
your conscience as 6 ransom, openly defiant and artistically incorrigible. 
i 7 define and defend my expression erupting from the 
bowels 8 of mainstream conformity. the deathrage in my pen 
has 9 overthrown the dictators of mediocrity, my war spirit 
10 transcends the constraints of physical entrapment. they 11 say 
that i'm a criminal but my pen is exonerator, i 
see 12 what all are blind to, for my eyes 
are compelled . 13 i am the rain, the cloud, 
the thunder. i am that black 14 tempest of providence 
inviting you into my soulwind
