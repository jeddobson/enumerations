formerly of Philly via Hamlet, North Carolina on

his way to brighter in sound good all around

(formerly a hard-shell case known for unmuted

sojourns down needles and crawls around in bottles)

gots key oil polishing cloth swabs rubbing alcohol

same ligature different mouthpiece—makes

tra-la-de-dahdaaa

Naaiiiiiiiiima

freeze frame: Bird heavy-jowled, thick-shouldered,

slit-eyed, Miles owl-eyed Reaper's stare, sunglasses

mislaid, J. C. sideways and slightly blurred, unable

to accommodate another clownishly unmusical minute

(liner notes by Auld Lang Syne)

never liked that never liked that never liked that

feeling of loss of no control of having to do it their way

to make a less-than-decent-living out of self-jive

expression eternally exploited o blues for a jazzmaker

orgasmic whines and bleats over and under and

over and under shredded with reedy pleadings

“faded on the crowing of the cock,” as Shakes says

from where his is found in her center's sweetness

scaling toward that twinned completeness

primitively bleeding devilish screeches

remonstrations against cracked ceilings

airless lofts lumpy mold-ravaged mattresses

as cold as inhospitable thighs tub stained

with the oils of countless bathers toilet

ill-bolted to warped floorboards tiny things

sprouting legs twiggling ears like blue notes

the stronger the reed, the more breath required

the darker the juice and stool

tra-de-dah

martyr to that timbre cut for a thinner heart

Naaiiiiiiiiima

demise is intonation without flexibility. what blows?

without that articulated jolt life will become

too soft/buzzy, the upper register flattened, the need

reed pinched shut against the mouth. no peace

the softer side is for the money denied hardness

the truth starves the revision eats

tra-la-de-dahdaaa

Naaiiiiiiiiima

a wordless song of love and religious conversion

as we tiptoe thru the backyards of our youth

freed of stylistic restraints and false analyses this new

drug called joy derived from melody abandoned

tra-la-de-dahdaaa

studied improvisations on the theme of heavenly happiness

transcribing zip-fingered solos on the air

for all to be elevated and illuminated by—The Real G

cascading triplets whistle thru brain tissue

like reed-stricken altissimo swung from

a brass-heavy noose from which further swings the divine

tool of his giving/the player discreetly strapped from alto

to soprano—an invisible workbook well-worn and

deemed redeemer from the root up

adjusting

timing to accommodate melodious high tones and

rhythmical explosions armed with piano chordings and

noodlings while percussive licks and thumps and whisks

advance upon ears under streaming pedal point

technique/reach/arc into the ultimate register

tra-la-de-dahdaaahda

don't sound like embouchure but rather reed-

on-tongue inhibitors yanked to retard pain (not

knowing there was permanent liver corruption

to come, the number forty scrawled hastily in the

sweat-dampened margins of a lead sheet) hoping

for a good response every time/a loose

and therefore syncopated rivering

get that smile feeling

pretend her lips and yours are stretching

love's tension at the corners of those kissibles

(his reed tastes of last night's sacred revelations)

lower lip stretched passionately over the bottom teeth

Naaaiiiiiiiiiimmmaaa
