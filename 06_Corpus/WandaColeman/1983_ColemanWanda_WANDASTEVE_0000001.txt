1 at the comedy store 2 the italian clown had 
his act together until he decided to 3 use the 
couple up front as foils 4 "how does it feel 
to be an interracial couple," 5 he asked loudly from 
the stage. 6 "we're not," the wife said. 7 "that's 
right," said her husband. 8 shaken, the clown was unable 
to continue his routine and 9 the new act came 
on 10 after interviewing them 11 the white producer listened 
silently as the jewish producer 12 told the couple she 
couldn't use them 13 "you're white," said the jewish producer. 
14 "i'm not white," said the husband. 15 "well, you 
look too white. we're in business. people 16 might think 
you're an interracial couple and get hung up in 17 
that. the film is about young couples adjusting to their 
new 18 babies and not social commentary. we don't want 
to have to 19 worry about distribution." 20 after the 
two women film-makers left, the two of them 21 stood 
in the center of the room and hugged each other 
for a 22 very long time 23 at the restaurant 
24 the pale blonde hostess asked them to "please wait 
a minute." 25 there was one empty table. a tall 
white brown-haired man 26 came in and stood behind them. 
the hostess returned and escorted 27 him to the table. 
she got upset and began to create a scene. 28 
he tried to calm her down as they left to 
find some other place 29 for breakfast 30 on the 
beach 31 they walked up the boardwalk, smiling and talking, 
watching 32 the kids rollerskate. they strolled past the bench 
where 33 two black winos were trying to attract stray 
pussy. one called 34 out to her 35 "hey, whore!" 
36 the husband put his arm protectively around his wife. 
she gave 37 the wino the finger 38 on their 
way to the bank 39 the man in his economy 
car pulled up along the curb and yelled 40 "traitor!" 
41 "was that for you or me?" the husband asked. 
42 "must've been for me," the wife said, "the man 
was black"
