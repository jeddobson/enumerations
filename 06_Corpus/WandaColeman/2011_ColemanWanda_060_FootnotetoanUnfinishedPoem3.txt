Mr. Kees? Mr. Weldon Kees? More distance from the sea, please!

I am asking the Oven God to give back Plath … I am hunting halfway

houses and upscale jukes, certain that Bob Kaufman and D. A. Levy

are mere whiffs away … I am searching boulder sites at Vasquez

Rocks for the treasure I heard Jeffers hid there with Everson's help …

Arno Schmidt is stuck in three black Borgesian doors … the mass graves …

the mass graves in which Paul Celan caresses the blackest of black hair … .
