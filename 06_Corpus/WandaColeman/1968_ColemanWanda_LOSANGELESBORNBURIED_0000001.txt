1 hear the automobile coffins? they drive crazy drive wild 
2 glide noisily thru this 3 burning smoggy sky and 
arid steel gray desert neath which 4 has been interred 
5 the beauty of my red beardless eagle-eyed forebears 6 
hear now this soft spoken black woman born of this 
cobalt 7 blue world 8 mourns silent mourns deep 9 
rides her sepulcher on wheels alone, for the pleasure clock 
of 10 romance 11 has been bashed in 12 and 
unmercifully destroyed in the deep eternal grind of 13 machines 
14 where her stinking meat 15 rots wrecked at society's 
bottom, blessed by cool denimed 16 crew-cut 17 saints who 
cruise calmly 18 in final rites of hungry avenue flesh 
and blood hunters 19 yes. los angeles cement cunt where 
die all my beautiful men 20 quiet in their level 
beds 21 of neon and holly wood. yes. and i 
too die here 22 give birth to babies/dreams 23 this 
tall black child of november drives shrouded in slacks of 
24 fad 25 my kinky crown tangled 26 in twisted 
combs of glass and granite in the grasping hands of 
27 5 p.m. traffic. this lone 28 woman lies waiting. 
waits to be fucked once again, impaled by 29 the 
30 lust of her ceramic lovers 31 yes. they abandon 
her to die, the men who have no power 32 
leave her to the arms of 33 still gray desert 
where she glides under sun in her sepulcher 34 on 
wheels 35 drives crazy drives wild 36 her radio blasting 
rhythm and blues along endless cool 37 corridors of freeway 
38 hoping, ever hoping love will claim her corpse and 
come 39 crashing 40 in on the fog
