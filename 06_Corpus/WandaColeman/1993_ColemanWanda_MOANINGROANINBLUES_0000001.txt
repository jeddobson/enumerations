1 when i get up in the mornin' 2 know 
i've lived to see another day 3 when i get 
up with cockcrow 4 know i've lived to see another 
day 5 if my dreary weren't so goddamned weary 6 
i wouldn't carry on this way 7 get up in 
the mornin' 8 gotta face another sun 9 get up 
in the mornin' 10 gotta face another sun 11 i'm 
so sick and tired of slavin' 12 hard work and 
trouble nevah have no fun 13 goin' back down in 
my blanket 14 put my misery to the wall 15 
gonna dive down in my blanket 16 turn my broke 
face to the wall 17 ain't nothin' gonna rouse me 
18 till i hear the trumpet call 19 refrain : 
what's life if all you know 20 of life is 
pain 21 what's life if all you know 22 of 
life is pain 23 what's the good in sufferin' 24 
if ain't no good to gain 25 when i get 
up in the mornin' 26 know i've made it thru 
another night 27 when i get up in the mornin' 
28 i know i've made it thru another night 29 
mister gloom doom come to get me 30 still weak 
yet strong enough to fight
