the fan from Taiwan is sputtering. the boring

commercials for male enhancement and arthritis

are on. the idiot thugsta in the spanking convertible

corners curbside, speakers set on boom. space shuttle

Discovery cracks the atmosphere at Edwards. the effing

faucet is dripping. someone's dragging their feet. rambunctious

feet are slapping the floor. the debt processor is at the

door. the Dodger fan is sputtering. the commercials

are much too much. the woman waddled into the corner

has her mouth set on boom, eyes stone-cracked

rattling the windows the cobwebs the bats. the

thousand sparrows are singing down the sun
