1 blue blooms on ridges, pales lips and nails 2 
son o son 3 hard's the harp in my soul's 
wailing 4 boy turned man turned ravaged babe in fate's 
maw 5 lightsome slim and sinking as implacable dream 6 
serene sounds the precipice above, below 7 white fevers tear 
the reason from his brain 8 nurse o nurse o 
nurse 9 and morphine brings on icy slumber 10 till 
on a sigh he slips away 11 the horror of 
sheer impotence strands us 12 in nameless chill 13 and 
we are dumbed. 14 mother father brother---all dumbed 15 after. 
i take cuttings of his hair and kiss the air
