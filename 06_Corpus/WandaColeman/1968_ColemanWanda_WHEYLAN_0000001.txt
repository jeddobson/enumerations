1 his keen teen dream puppy love turned to pain 
2 when i told him what kind of grown-up 3 
black woman i wanted to be in the push-button sputnik 
world 4 not knowing what that meant for me 5 
for him/black man 6 not knowing why the distance grew 
between us 7 not knowing why he let go of 
my hand and walked faster 8 and faster as i 
walked faster and faster 9 to keep up barely able 
to keep up 10 with him moving faster and faster 
away from me 11 daring him to tell me why 
i couldn't be somebody someday 12 in the white world 
until he walked so fast i had to run 13 
to keep up with him and one day i asked 
him why 14 couldn't a woman be every bit as 
good as a man 15 he broke into a frantic 
sweat and leapt onto a passing bus 16 and left 
me staring after him screaming 17 why can't i?
