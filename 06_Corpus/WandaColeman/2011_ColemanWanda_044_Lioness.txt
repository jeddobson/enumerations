in the jungle of sound and cement, she stalks meaning

lifts forepaws, flashes talons like blades, tears flesh bloody

headlines to heartaches

she feeds contentious cubs

roves darks with iridescent eyes, mates unfettered

hear her prowl beyond the undergrowth

eternal against unseen teemings and writhings

know it all matters. know the roar goes on
