1 jailer? will you still love me when i'm flit? 
2 will you pay to hear my angst of sob 
and bathe in it? 3 jailer, the cuffs between us 
the cuffs so dear! 4 what will you do when 
i'm no longer accessible by key? 5 jailer? do you 
believe faint cure bests 6 no cure at all? 7 
i do not know my back as well as you 
do 8 all down my crack and up it too 
9 jailer! this contraband is such i can't conceal 10 
wears my lips and shreds umbilical zeal 11 the chancre 
blossom of our forced embrace 12 will never heal 13 
jailer, why so quiet? 14 i can hear a politician 
piss on cotton
