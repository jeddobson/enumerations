He had just gotten out on bail. He didn't have 
any place to stay. He asked to stay with her. 
You can stay here for a while. I'll give you 
a key if you make one promise, she said. What, 
he asked. Please don't be sneaky about it when you 
leave. Just return it to me face-to-face. You got it. 
Thank you. That first night together they slept in the 
same bed. But they were strangers and he could feel 
her not wanting to be touched. I've had enough misery. 
I want to be real with a man. I want 
him real with me. I want a partner. Fifty-fifty. Understand? 
He looked at her. His eyes were shining. He nodded 
yes. They slept together the next night. It felt good 
between them. When she woke the next morning she was 
alone in bed. There lay the key where he had 
slept, in the pillow. She lifted the pillow with the 
key nestled in the soft indenta- tion left by where 
his head had lay. She hugged it gently and felt 
the cool metallic kiss of the key against her warm 
dark skin. Yes, she said.
