1 poverty is its own calamity 2 (all that night-got 
rug burns on my knees) 3 the flavorless light was 
ever enriched 4 by the multilayered dark 5 (insects flirted 
at the lips of the bottle) 6 circumstances have not 
helped me 7 (the potted tree grew hands and replanted 
itself 8 in true soil) 9 i sent a message 
to the Black Nation 10 it came back singed, stamped 
11 "addressee burned to the ground , 12 no forwarding." 
13 i was born halfway between a noose and a 
knot 14 (the smell of vanilla sends my water running) 
15 misery has made me a believer 16 (the years 
drop away with his enterings) 17 do i remember a 
time when 18 the love for one mother's son 19 
meant love for us all?
