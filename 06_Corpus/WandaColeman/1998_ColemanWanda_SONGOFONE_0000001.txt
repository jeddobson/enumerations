1 life was a spiral staircase on which 2 we 
stumbled up and down simultaneously 3 as it clattered and 
spun like a 4 xylophone gone bags. when his nature 
5 was weak i was drawn to other men despite 
my vow. 6 when his nature was strong he was 
drawn to other 7 women despite his vow. it took 
music and more 8 music and still more music to 
keep us 9 one thing unto another. there was jazz 
10 rock soul and ska. sometimes 11 his heartbeat drummed 
against my ear. sometimes 12 my crescendo arrested his pulse. 
then once---just 13 a significant once---we stopped breathing 14 long 
enough to compose a coda for our oratorio
