1 playpoets gather round 2 the table. tonight they are 
carving up 3 a macho moist morsel gray-eyed 4 sandy-haired 
straggler in 5 celluloid fairyland 6 in the corner he 
nods, tries to forget the smell of her thighs 7 
wishing she wouldn't speak. niggah bitch ghost 8 smoke red 
eye nod down we turn on 9 to each other 
each love making takes 10 longer more intense rivers run 
down 11 my inner walls he grasps and eyes 12 
close in rhythm his fine beige frame 13 forget the 
pain gold comfort stained 14 in our aborted procreative efforts 
we 15 die together and are reborn at 4 a.m. 
16 the hyena rang the doorbell the stinking meat of 
our dead 17 affair squeezed into his attache case staining 
the pages of 18 his ms: "i've come to meet 
your husband. i'm going to 19 frankfurt with a russian 
whore" 20 i'm reminded of another who had to see 
me before he and 21 his wife left for spain 
and another who had to have me 22 one more 
time before winging to frisco, his 23 round of dog 
food and wine commercials up 24 they either get too 
much of me or not enough 25 dear daughter, there 
is a cut of man who haunts the alleys and 
avenues scarfing adventure/pro bums satisfied to spill cum into any 
orifice as long as it's tight; who play the game 
of fame by shattering the dreams of the children they 
father. they read glory in chan- cres, vomit, spit, mucus, 
tears and blood. they will shove it to you anyway 
they can and a month after they've split leaving you 
dangling between suicide and insanity, come back to bor- row 
five bucks and sympathy. beware. learn the smell of this 
man. it's the laughing face whose eyes never smile 27 
gas heater glow his eyes he lights 28 the pipe 
we fall into step we are 29 now leaving hamlin 
we are now beyond 30 the moon stroking bold and 
cold no rose 31 has ever smelled as good as 
that 32 mammie jammie sipping coffee and 33 turning on 
to juju whip it whip it 34 i'm water he 
takes a drink 35 playpoets touch blooded fingers 36 to 
yawning mouths. another 37 tasty life appropriately spiced with 38 
liquor, drugs and a pinch of sex 39 an adequate 
and filling meal 40 at the corner i stop before 
the flashing red lights. the blue 41 fag looks out 
over sunset boulevard and sighs 42 he is ruler of 
the realm
