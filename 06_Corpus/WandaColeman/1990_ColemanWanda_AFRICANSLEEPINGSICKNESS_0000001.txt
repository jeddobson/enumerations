lullaby8 my father hoists me over his shoulder, holds me 
9 snug to him. i cannot walk 10 we move 
thru the sea of stars in blue 11 i love 
my father's strength 12 i love how blue the blue 
is 13 and the coolness of stars against my face 
14 he sings me "my blue heaven"15 i am tied 
hand and foot 16 astraddle the gray county hospital bed 
on the basement floor 17 my scream smothered in 4Ã—4 
adhesive 18 nothing on but the too short too thin 
cotton gown 19 above a naked saffron bulb in socket 
20 nothing else in the ward but empty beds row 
upon row 21 and barred windows 22 i do not 
know why i'm here or who i am 23 i 
see my wounds 24 they belong to the black child25 
giant green leech-dinosaurs invade the city 26 superman flies to 
rescue but weakened by kryptonite 27 can't stop the havoc 
28 the slug creatures destroy the city, ooze into the 
Sierras/ 29 along my back into my spinal cord leaving 
a trail 30 of upper Jurassic slime 31 (it gets 
down to skin and bones. skin/the body's last line 32 
of defense. when awakened the impulse to become---a 33 cavernous 
hunger unfillable unsated 34 bones/the minimal elements 35 of survival) 
36 "who am i?" 37 the physician observes my return 
to consciousness 38 the petite white man with sable hair 
and clark kents 39 makes note. he is seated in 
front of a panorama 40 hills and A-frames sloping to 
the sea 41 "who am i," i ask again 42 
"who do you think you are?" he asks 43 "i'm 
not myself," i say44 the encephalopathy of slavery---trauma to racial 
cortices 45 resulting in herniated ego/loss of self 46 rupture 
of the socio-eco spleen and 47 intellectual thrombosis 48 ( 
terminal ) 49 sing me rivers the anthem of blue 
waters the hymn of 50 genesis51 lift up your voice 
and 52 the tympanic reverberation of orgasmic grunt 53 ejaculatio 
praecox 54 traumatized. infected. abrupt behavioral changes 55 the vomitus/love-stuff 
56 he watches me masturbating with the Jamaican dancer 57 
whose hand is up my womb to the elbow 58 
and starts to cry 59 the weight swells my heart/cardiopulmonary 
edema 60 doubled in size it threatens to pop 61 
i ask the doctor why things are so distorted 62 
"we've given you morphine 63 for the pain of becoming"64 
chills. sing to me fever. sing to me. myalgia. sing 
to me 65 delirium. sing to me. fluid filled lungs 
66 i walk eternal night 67 in the room done 
in soft maroon warm mahogany amber 68 gold 69 we 
disrobe to the dom-dom-dom a heady blues suite 70 i 
pity the man his 4-inch penis 71 then am horrified 
as it telescopes upward becoming a 72 -quart bottle of 
Coca-Cola 73 i talk quite coherently they say74 fucking in 
the early dark of evening 75 mid-stroke he's more interested 
in being overheard 76 i go back into my trance 
as we resume the 77 o'clock news 78 the car 
won't start. the mechanic is drunk 79 i can't break 
his snore. the engine whines sputters 80 clunks shutters in 
the uncanny stillness 81 they're coming for me. i've got 
to escape 82 angry, i lash out at the steering 
wheel, strike 83 my somnambulate lover in his chest 84 
he jumps out of bed yelling 85 "what's wrong?" 86 
the curse of ever-dreaming 87 sing to me, i say. 
sing to me of rivers
