the help offered is tantamount to confusion,

nothing or the deepening of the morass

there is a constant though fruitless spinning

a beauty spun from pettiness and myopia

there is no explication or illumination bright

enough to clear either the doorways or the mind

endless thrummings, like stubborn wings

over-engorge the core with fright's blood

suspension mid-drop is revelatory/a sting that

signals one is twisting in cobwebs
