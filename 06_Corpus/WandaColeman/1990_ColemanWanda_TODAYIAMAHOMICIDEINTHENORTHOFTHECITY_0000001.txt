1 on this bus to oblivion i bleed in the 
seat 2 numb silent rider 3 bent to poverty/my blackness 
covers me like the 4 american flag over the coffin 
of some hero killed in action 5 unlike him i 
have remained unrecognized, unrewarded 6 eyes cloaked in the shroud 
of hopelessness 7 search advancing avenues for a noisy haven 
8 billboards press against my face 9 reminders of what 
i can't afford to buy 10 laughing fantasies speed past 
in molded steel luxury 11 i get off at a 
dark corner 12 and in my too tight slacks 13 
move into the slow graceful mood of shadow 14 i 
know my killer is out there
