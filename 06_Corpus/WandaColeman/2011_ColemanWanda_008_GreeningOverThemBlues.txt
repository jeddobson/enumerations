maybe it is 1969 and i'm showing too much leg while

droppin' dimes in that phone booth on South Broadway, USA

the slip and glide of my attitude matching the eternal wiggle

of my hips as i slide into a day laborer's dreamscape

my faux bouffant a massive snarl of brown-bomber curls

paisley angel top hugging my ribs from A to navel

as i TKO eyeballs with a four-four strut, inviting

slow rides on the mercy seat and smooches in F sharp

maybe it is that last day of the week of the last wait

whatever it is, Lord Alice has defined it with his croon

that juicy mambo combo backing up every oooch

with a rose of red satin refrain—as freshly plucked thorns bleed

the final sigh from a universal klatch of cold soul survivors

those luscious liverlips smacking until the goosebumps rise

a response to memories of lovers begging improvise

baby—i'm steeped in the sounds of my wild wild youth

my shoulders locked to the lead guitar strum, the

whisk whipping my heart via ears, a verdant profusion

of warm coronets, tapping fingers and toes, moans on cue

then

his lips scat through my center

turn me the color of dang the color of jesusgodomighty
