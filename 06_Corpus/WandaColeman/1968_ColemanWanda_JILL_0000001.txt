I spotted her on her way into the liquor store 
as I got into my car. I called, "Jill!" She 
hunched her shoulders, turned slowly, then came over. It had 
been twenty-odd years. She recognized me but not my name. 
I was a sucker for the sob in those tired, 
drab-olive eyes. The years had rode her hard. She'd been 
the prettiest gal in our colored junior high---spun gold hair, 
gold skin and go-light green eyes---that beautiful mix of cree 
indian and black made all the boys swoon. I wanted 
to yakkitty-yak old home week, but was in a rush. 
I insisted on her phone number and address. As she 
wrote hastily, she explained her life as two daughters and 
two failed marriages. I was busy bleeding sentiment and thought 
nothing of it when she hit me up for forty 
cents more on the price of a half pint. I 
gave her a dollar and waved. When I got home 
that night, I entertained the romance of bopping by her 
crib with a short dog and jawing over the world. 
I got out the note she'd written and looked at 
it closely. The feeling had not been mutual.
