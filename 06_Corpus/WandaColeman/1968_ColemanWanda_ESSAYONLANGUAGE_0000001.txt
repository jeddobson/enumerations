1 who stole the cookie from the 2 cookie jar? 
3 this began somewhere 4 suggest middle passage. consider the 
dutch ship 5 consider adam and eve and pinchmenot 6 
blacks think in circles she said. no they don't 7 
i said it too readily, too much on the defense. 
of course 8 blacks think in circles. i think in 
circles 9 why did i feel it necessary to jump 
on the defensive. 10 defensiveness 11 is sure sign of 
being gored by unpleasant truth 12 equation: black skin + 
new money = counterfeit 13 i keep going back over 
the same thoughts all the time (the 14 maze 15 
poverty poverty poverty 16 syndrome oft times accompanies social stigmata) 
17 sex sex sex 18 desperately seeking absolute understanding (the 
way out)--- 19 black black black 20 the impossible (my 
love relationship wears me thin) i know 21 number one 
stole the cookie 22 but knowing doesn't 23 stop me 
from thinking about it---trying to be the 24 best i 
can spurred by blackness but they keep telling me the 
25 best fashion in which to escape linguistic ghettoization 26 
is to 27 ignore the actuality of blackness blah blah 
blah and it will 28 cease to 29 have factual 
power over my life. which doesn't 30 make sense to 
me---especially when the nature of mirrors 31 is to reflect 
32 when a mirror does not reflect what it is? 
not necessarily a 33 window, 34 merely glass? can it 
be something other than a glass? and once 35 it

violent animal can't take it no more can't 37 take 
it anymore from anyone tired of being 38 one in

against you in that paranoiac $$$ 43 prism keep trying 
to see yourself/reflection 44 oooh black as swamp bottom mired 
in muck you 45 violent animal struggle struggle struggle to 
46 get to solid ground get free get solidified/ 47 
grounded 48 substitute writer for mirror, visionary for window, hack 
for 49 glass 50 who me? couldn't be 51 (smashing 
is addictive and leads to greater acts of violence/ 52 
throwing things, i.e. the first sign of danger) 53 equation: 
colorlessness + glibness = success 54 i am occasionally capable 
of linear thought, stream of 55 consciousness 56 and hallucinate 
after a three day fast (have eyes will see) 57 
i'm much too much into my head. stressed. i can't 
feel 58 anything 59 below the neck 60 number two 
stole the cookie 61 he says he hates me 62 
and i'm wondering what in 63 hell on earth did 
i do except 64 be who he says he loves 
to hate 65 equation: circle + spear = spiral 66 
going down and in at the same time going outward 
and up 67 absolutely 68 this ends and begins here
