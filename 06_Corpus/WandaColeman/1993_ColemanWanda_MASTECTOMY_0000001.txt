aureolae 3 remember living 4 forget cool evening air kisses 
the rush of 5 liberation freed from the brassiere 6 
forget the cupping of his hands the pleasure 7 his 
eyes looking down/anticipating 8 forget his mouth. his tongue at 
the nipples 9 his intense hungry nursing 10 forget sensations 
which begin either 11 on the right or the left. 
go thru the body 12 linger between thighs 13 forget 
the space once grasped during his ecstasy 14 sweet sweet 
mama you taste so
