The night I died, there was this thirty-eight thousand dollar

check cruisin' in my wallet, stinkin' of good times ahead. And

shit yeah, Nig-gah here was on the phone. Smokin' yet, and

workin' the receiver. And, check it, gots lung cancer. Wasn't

'sposed to be smokin', as you know. But what could them

muthafucking doctors tell me about it? What was I gonna do,

live on? For what? To rip-off money from one more simple

bitch enamored of my considerable gifts? Was I gonna have

to pay the price of listenin' to her snot up and cry, and watch

her pull-and-shake that stringy hair, or maybe threaten to get

Daddy's thugs to lump me up? What was I gonna do? Know what

she wanted. She wanted me to drag on another ten days and let

her play nurse-me-back-to-health, let her act out our drama/my

fantastic spastic collapse, into her arms no less. And when they'd

find me the next mornin', cold as a wharf rat, they'd also find

pages and pages of odes, paeans, and sonnets im-mor-tal-i-zing

our undying romance.

Shit man, that cigarette, that whiskey,

that blues, and your ear were all I needed.
