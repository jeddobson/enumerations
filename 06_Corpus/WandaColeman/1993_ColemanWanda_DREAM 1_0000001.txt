1 globules of silver light recede 2 become smaller orbs 
by the shrieking 3 instant. i am hurled outward and 
away 4 my bleeding brooding dropped thru time as the 
5 lights shift and shimmer to form clusters of 6 
spiraling galaxies as faster i plunge 7 from the frame 
into a vat of fleshy darkness. the 8 ceiling clams 
shut overhead. walls umbrella 9 upward to a tomblike close. 
the bed shrouds me 10 in tulips of soul-cold bleached 
cotton. lightning 11 exalts the windows cloaked in pale slate 
toile 12 where a fierceness flies/frantic batting raven 13 wings. 
i reach to free the trapped bird/feel his 14 death-grip/my 
father's large-boned earth-colored 15 talons pull me into the panes 
which shatter 16 in my ears/the alarm sounding sunrise and 
the 17 second rain of storm-laden spring
