1 that's where Mama used that tree limb when 2 
she got seriously angry she'd pick the leaves 3 off 
at the knot those ol' knots would bite 4 while 
the branch stung and my blackness 5 would rise like 
bread dough 6 these are where i was attacked by 
hundreds of 7 fleas the first night i slept on 
that ol' 8 blue couch on the veranda of my 
first 9 Hollywood apartment no one would rent to me 
10 except this old Jewish woman with gamblin' debts 11 
there's where he used to bop me when i got 
too 12 smart so i looked like i had three 
eyes he 13 didn't like me so ambitious/wantin' more than 
he 14 or i could provide even tho he was 
married and 15 she was expectin' again 16 that there 
is from where the car door on 17 that tore 
down ol' Buick keeps catchin' me 18 behind the elbow 
when i come home from work so 19 damned tired 
it's all i can do to stumble 20 out and 
crawl up on the porch 21 there, that is from 
where an itty vein broke my 22 veins so frail 
i can't even donate blood they 23 just break like 
that without any effort 24 giant purple spots spread out 
tight under my 25 skin like molasses on toast 26 
don't be silly. that's just how my head is made
