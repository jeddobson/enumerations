the avenue spinning in private orbit 4 one around the 
other mutually rapt they fail to 5 see her estranged

and anger coming towards them 8 "who is this guy," 
the poltergeist demands. she 9 senses trouble and to avoid 
it asks her new encounter 10 to go on ahead 
while she straightens things. he 11 cooperates reluctantly after a 
kiss 12 "what's this all about?" her ex-poltergeist trembles. she

left me. i have my needs. i 16 don't like

19 him it's possible." 20 "what about me?" 21 "go

have to purge my crystal ball
