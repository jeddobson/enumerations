Baby Sis ran away from home in the 70s. we 
don't talk or write much but we know each other 
well. back in 71 Mom and i made a non-stop 
17 hour drive into New Mexico to rescue her from 
starvation. she was gone again soon we didn't get along 
too well at the time and i didn't see much 
of her. i am the oldest and she is the 
youngest. i'm tall, she's short. we both have a weight 
problem. i'm indian red, she's cafe au lait. my hair 
is short black kinks, hers is long chocolate twists and 
curls. she's built like Mom, i'm built like Pop. she's 
into the church, i'm into the world. i always remember 
her birthday, she never remembers mine she married a young 
white guy, 2nd generation Ger- man whose father is into 
aerospace. it was back in 75 and i jetted to 
Kansas for their wedding. when she threw the bou- quet, 
i caught it. within a year i had again married 
the wrong-man-for-me for the 2nd time once upon a visit 
she snuck and stuck a decal on the back of 
my writing chair: 5 "Oh God keep your hand 6 
upon me as I travel 7 and help me reach 
my 8 destination in safety. 9 Amen." 10 Compliments, Pallotine 
Missionaries because she put it there i decided never to 
remove it
