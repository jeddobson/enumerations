1 he says it's important news about the virus 2 
and reads it to me 3 it's a habit we've 
acquired over our years 4 together and while i prefer 
to read 5 some things myself i don't mind his 
gesture 6 of affection 7 it reminds me of the 
day mother quit reading 8 to me and told me 
i was big enough to do it 9 myself. it 
reminds me of papa reading from the 10 bible before 
breakfast on sunday mornings. it 11 reminds me of how 
i used to sneak and go thru the 12 dresser 
where mama hid the dirty paperbacks; how i'd 13 speed 
read them and sneak them back unnoticed 14 today's article 
is one more of many we've read 15 discussing the

do. we 18 feel glad we found each other (in 
time). and then we 19 think about the lovers we 
had 20 just before we hooked up 21 and wish 
them good health
