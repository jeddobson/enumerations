1 together they cruised thru Beverly Hills 2 "killin'" white 
folk 3 laughin' (sippin' Silver Satin and V.O.) 4 they 
be partners stoned and angry 5 cadillac low and wide 
snatching moonlight 6 stylin' 7 teeth against brown velvet skin 
doin' 8 a step'n fetchit routine, drinkin', droppin' reds 9 
some purple haze too 10 Hatred steps out of his 
hiding place (our souls) 11 comes 'live 12 "Goddamnit man, 
that bastard's a pimp!" 13 everytime we try to make 
love 14 he lays between us 15 Hatred he drives 
movin' thru downtown 16 breaking windows indiscriminately 17 screaming bitterly, 
"yah goddamned muthafuckas" 18 meaning absentee landlords and 19 solicitous 
shopkeepers 20 then they fade, blending into night 21 carrying 
stolen loot home 22 drunk chatting eagerly 23 to the 
fence/a man of leisure and 24 fat pockets 25 "Shit,

barflies in dank alleys 33 hopin' to break the spell 
34 boredom and pending dead ends 35 like chumps they 
get caught 36 jail time 37 meantime that ol' silva 
satin niggah rides 38 long lean finely clean takin' 39 
good care of the cadillac until 40 the boys "raise" 
41 as he licks his chops greasin' down the streets 
42 lookin' for more chumps 43 they say Hatred drives 
a hard bargain 44 but he sold us out cheap
