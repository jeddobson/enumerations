1 this night i write a psalm 2 on one 
of Norm's stained dinner napkins 3 sitting here 4 after 
a breathless dizzy drive 5 thru the streets for hours 
6 hunting a seclusion in which to eat my thoughts 
7 and mull you over 8 i'm at a counter 
waiting 9 for steak and eggs 10 starved for the 
flesh of your loin 11 white paper napkins are what 
dreams are made of 12 there's a message here 13 
somewhere
