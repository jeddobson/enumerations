1 the lean months drag on/legions 2 of faceless men 
in a 3 calendar of lies 4 paydays/duns/debts 5 one 
by one i cross them off 6 burdens peel away/layers 
of skin 7 chapped cracked bitten 8 under sun/wind/finance 9 
i farm the barren soil of city 10 my legacy 
the taut noose, 11 a stern plow, intolerant cotton---a harvest 
12 of slaves & share-croppers 13 mine eyes have seen 
the horror 14 they tug at me, the children 15 
persistent at hem of my weary skirt 16 we must 
eat. we must have shelter 17 we must 18 live. 
out of my hand/sweat/bread 19 scheme. no time to idle 
in 20 green pastures or chase stray dogs 21 through 
daisy laden fields 22 i must 23 mark off each 
day one more mouth fed 24 one more bed made 
25 one more penny pinched 26 one more diaper flagging 
in sunshine 27 at night those stars too far away 
28 come down, light my pillow 29 i put my 
feet up, lay back 30 catch a dream 31 one 
more day. one more victory
