1 we drive in from Golden Gate City 2 the 
host and i share a joint/silence 3 my thoughts break 
against safety glass, shatter 4 i smell my blood 5 
can't stop the blood 6 kind, the host sees and 
says nothing 7 what can you do for the dead 
8 but ease their journey 9 he passes the smoke. 
i take a draw 10 we cross the Bay Bridge 
into a quieter time 11 stoned euphoric pain, i 12 
ease out into cold night, enter sanctuary 13 retreat to 
my bunk, a mess 14 the host retires 15 alone, 
i open up my chest, cut out my heart 16 
stop the flow
