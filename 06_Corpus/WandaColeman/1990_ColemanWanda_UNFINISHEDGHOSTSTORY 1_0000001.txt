1 this used to be her office. 2 it's chilly 
in here. 3 they've taken out some of the equipment 
and moved it 4 over to the new building. 5 
what was she like? 6 quiet. a good worker, actually. 
but a loner---kind of 7 eccentric. 8 how so? 9 
she was an odd dresser---head wraps, flashy jewelry---that 10 kind 
of thing. she wasn't very good at small talk. not 
a 11 gofer. it was her independent attitude, unsuited 12 
to this kind of job. 13 what's that odor? 14 
some cheap perfume. she always kept a bottle of it 
there in 15 the upper right hand drawer. 16 i've 
heard noises in here in the late afternoon. sometimes 17 
the word processor clicks on by itself and begins typing. 
18 yes. others have made the same complaint. 19 and 
Lopez, the security guard has seen her going in and 
20 out of the ladies' restrooms. he's tried to catch 
her, but she 21 turns a corner and disappears. 22 
yes. the boys in the mail room have bitched to 
23 administration that she appears at 8 a.m. every Thursday 
24 and deposits invisible mail into the slots. 25 what 
are they going to do about it? 26 corporate exorcism. 
27 isn't that dangerous business? 28 routine, these days.
