3 tug at my skin/dreams mama can't fulfill 4 out 
here on the damned avenue 5 waiting for a bus 
ride home 6 my tongue against my teeth/wired 7 on 
pills to prevent pregnancy 8 pills to melt away the 
fat 9 marijuana to tone down lack-of-money pressures 10 rain 
against me beating hard as my heart 11 wet my 
shoes wet my pants wet my face 12 shivering in 
the cold as it 13 brings on the flu
