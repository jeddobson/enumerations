1 pardon me, but you're standing on my stomach 2 
those aren't grapefruit you're squeezing 3 and certainly not papaya 
4 and niggahplease! don't you dare speak of coconuts 5 
if you must insist that this is a gold rush, 
6 there are planes leaving hourly for South Africa & 
the Yukon 7 there's nothing beneath this sternum but 8 
blood vessels rib bone & a significant muscular organ 9 
which gives off no feelings unless malfunctioning 10 and when 
11 you get tired of syphoning off my sweetwater 12 
and pillaging my salt lakes maybe we might discuss 13 
conservation and recycling 14 until then 15 i suggest adventure 
be omitted from the equation 16 this ain't the jungle, 
jim 17 so quit stickin' your tarzan in my jane
