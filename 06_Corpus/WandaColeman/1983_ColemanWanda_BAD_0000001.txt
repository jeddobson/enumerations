1 night at the taco house 2 he came in 
to rob the place 3 the waitresses were flush fear 
and tears 4 the guys sat around yammering 5 what 
he was doing caused some kind of disruption 6 he 
beckoned. i went over to his corner 7 he put 
the gun to my head, said 8 "empty the register" 
9 the kiss deep hard cold against my temple 10 
there was a click sound 11 if i move sudden 
i'm dead, i thought 12 and if i hesitate this 
clown might off me 13 and so i said, "shoot 
motherfucka or quit wasting my time" 14 there was surprised 
silence 15 then everyone broke into strained laughter 16 "it's 
a joke," he said, "you didn't cry like the other 
girls" 17 and there were slaps on the back and 
18 cracks about my ice cool 19 and from that 
day till the day i quit 20 everybody kept their 
distance
