1 i snap out of my distraction and hurry from 
the 2 bus and 3 realize i overshot the melrose 
exit. it's a cold 4 clear winter's 5 night and 
i'm stranded on a Hollywood street corner 6 lights on 
7 buildings and marquees make my eyes feel brand new 
8 people are 9 going about their commerce, in and 
out of buildings 10 and numerous 11 construction sites. i'm 
freezing, no coat, and 12 anxious to 13 get home. 
i seek out a phone booth and begin dialing 14 
frantic 15 actually i'm at a casual affair and am 
immensely 16 enjoying 17 my dance with a guinean gentleman. 
he is very polite 18 and makes no 19 moves. 
the music stops. he thanks me, then escorts me 20 
over to a 21 quiet corner where he introduces me 
to a British 22 Shakespearian 23 actor. we begin chit-chat 
24 still dialing i can't get through i can't get 
through 25 i'm tired 26 i want to go home 
and wonder how long it'll take me to 27 hoof 
it 28 maybe twenty minutes. after a few persistent rings 
he 29 answers 30 sleepily distant. he's been napping again, 
i think 31 angrily, then 32 ask him to come 
pick me up and he says, yeah, of course 33 
where are you? 34 i look around for street signs 
and say, the corner of 35 Selma and 36 Hill. 
he doesn't understand. "Where's that?" i 37 repeat it 38 
anxious over our apparent miscommunication. to 39 complicate 40 matters 
the vista begins to shift as i talk. suddenly i'm 
41 at the 42 corner of Fountain and Nietzsche, then 
La Brea and Sunset 43 which is easy 44 for 
him to find. he yawns, "Okay" and i hang up, 
still 45 angry, waiting 46 i decide i may as 
well walk to keep warm and am suddenly 47 joined 
by the 48 British Shakespearian actor and Kat, my old 
runnin' buddy 49 from twenty 50 years back. they appear 
out of thin air to accompany 51 me with chit-chat 
52 and we're suddenly home which is my parents' house 
53 Kat and the 54 actor bid me farewell and 
vanish as my lover comes 55 out on the 56 
porch surprised to see me. i cuss him for not 
57 coming to 58 pick me up. the car is 
still parked in the driveway 59 he has no 60 
excuse and no apology 61 then we're in the laundry 
alcove next to the washing 62 machine 63 which is 
rapidly filling with hot water. i'm preparing 64 the wash 
when 65 my lover comes over to kiss me. i 
attack him, knocking 66 him to the 67 floor with 
the weight of my body. i begin to bury him 
68 head first 69 in his own pile of dirty 
shirts 70 i awake, my eyes focused on the levelor 
blinds. it is 71 raining. i 72 remember the letters 
i forgot to mail yesterday
