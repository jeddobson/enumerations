1 dear Georgiana, 2 the trees are full now, palms 
3 bless the skyline and winter 4 never arrives. don't 
worry, i 5 haven't forgotten my promise 6 altho it 
seems impossible to 7 keep without your support. if 8 
you were here, you'd prove the 9 proper Big Sis 
and knock me 10 on the noggin with a sage 
fist 11 at my desk i dredge for the 12 
bodies of survivors. they fill 13 the absence briefly and 
then 14 vanish into angry impotent and 15 accusatory splatts. 
why-have- 16 nots peck at my ears. i turn 17 
up the volume till the walls 18 shake to rolling 
stones, black 19 night's fallings and dogs at bay 20 
in the morning, i'm greeted by 21 talking leaves and 
ghost mushrooms 22 and the soft mist off the coast, 
23 the scuttlings of ring-tailed 24 opossums stealing food from 
feline 25 odalisques too sated to stir, the 26 flittings 
of doves on the mate 27 and in my reverie 
i seek you out 28 to share my favorite lullaby 
29 it is i who sits beside you 30 it 
is i who sings from the shallows 31 it is 
i scratching against this silence
