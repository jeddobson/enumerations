1 from blonde shores and languid childhood lulls 2 the 
sweep of aquamarine carries weight down 3 opal and obsidian 
eyes shine strangely there 4 as if some golden vision 
mitigates despair 5 starlight gleams eternal in the endless smoke

they slowly draw the sighing from the breasts. cool 11 
fish ring cool thighs on this, the final trip as 
12 laminaria and Irish moss embrace each fingertip 13 below, 
the loved downed in somber drift 14 into God's deep, 
renowned on every wave as 15 spume and coastal wind 
and shadow zone
