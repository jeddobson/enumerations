1 you stranger, you call yourself my friend. 2 you 
are my grief. you 3 shadow me to my grave, 
you yank up my bones, lick the rot 4 your 
red tongue is victorious 5 you go back to your 
bed of poetry and suck 6 the tip of your 
treacherous pen. you 7 have no conscience to clear. 8 
i am a stabbed woman. is it any wonder i 
stab back? 9 i shake my silence at the crowd 
that wears 10 your bitch face your straw-blond ambition 11 
your fake empty justice your cunt-shallow empathy 12 how do 
i dig you out of my gut? 13 how do 
i forget that you, my only witness, 14 would not 
testify on my behalf 15 forget? no. i forget nothing. 
not your theft 16 of my cause, speaking for me 
better, you say, 17 than i speak for myself 18 
my struggle time against closed hearts has been long 19 
all my flowers are crushed 20 all branches felled 21 
there is nothing to treasure 22 all is tin 23 
your ego is a fortress. above, a 24 leaden heaven. 
stone birds. trees with ink for sap. 25 that place 
where i am written off & out 26 all my 
dreams are the ashes contained in a granite urn 27 
imagine my mindscape of great melancholy canyons 28 filled with 
dangerous silences 29 or aborigine plains of windkissed wheat like 
30 oceans of sunblessed hair where memories 31 decompose to 
nourish a wounded earth 32 imagine. i am Navajo. dweller 
in my caved hunger 33 starved slowly by the fires 
dying in your eyes, 34 a form changing before you 
as you creep near. 35 you steal the song out 
of my mouth 36 take my rhythms as yours 37 
dance my dance 38 wear my skin to deceive the 
viewers 39 on the first day of eternity i hated 
you 40 i will hate you on the last. this 
is your power. 41 your life insults my breath 42 
you are from the country that lies between 43 ignorance 
& idolatry. you gather tribes only 44 to cannibalize choice 
members 45 you suffer calculated amnesia. you 46 forget those 
who remind you of what you really are. 47 you 
forget the soulful women 48 the women forced to abandon 
their 49 children to feed them 50 the women deprived 
of whole men 51 the women who gave their hearts 
without reward 52 the women who loved the dead to 
life 53 giddy & indifferent you bed the apparitions too 
weak 54 to protest your lust. you crown yourself 55 
Queen of Dust, you, the so lovely animal seductress 56 
sublime 57 while i freeze. here. a clunk of blue 
58 outside. unnoticed. somber. famished. 59 perhaps if i had 
been colored male 60 a shining whiteness shaft-deep in your 
sludge pot 61 perhaps then i would be deemed half-human 
62 perhaps if 63 i had escaped 64 a permanent 
disappearance 65 at the behest of 66 a malevolent dictator, 
67 jailed & severed from my nipples 68 perhaps then 
i'd be worthy of inclusion 69 my agony more romantic 
in the retelling 70 having occurred on foreign soil mere 
blocks 71 from the embassy you frequent 72 day 73 
i am blind. i cannot see objects clearly. all 74 
are ghosts phantoms imaginings. queer spooks 75 flicker in and 
out of focus 76 shapes loom up suddenly only to 
77 instantly shimmer to a fade 78 i am stark 
staring sad 79 under the sizzle of shine, 80 a 
lone woman gropes 81 through the searing silence 82 bewildered 
83 by the faint sweet breeze 84 her murderer's laughter 
85 ringing in the invisible dawn 86 you! stranger. you 
call yourself my champion
