1 i am planetary with sugar & double 2 vision. 
the compulsive consumption of frustrated 3 power rings the Saturn 
of my system/the subsumed 4 wildness of a woman too 
long unembraced/underappreciated 5 erupts thru my skin, weeps & oozes 
salveless 6 nonspecific accusations leave me asplash 7 in grand 
& defensive speculations 8 stale odors of coriander & vanilla 
ill-shelved over summer 9 i slip into the flannel robe 
10 of my adolescence, 11 raid the refrigerator of my 
tender 12 dramas. by a tiny pale amber cat's eye 
13 i reach for the butter-iced date & walnut cake 
14 that gave me the runs for hours 15 therefore 
gave away my childish invasion. 16 i thirst for the 
cold white quench 17 of quarts of whole milk, downed 
under covert 18 layers of nylon & night to the 
rhythms of 19 Pop's snores & Mom's fantasies 20 coastal 
morning aromas of bacon toast coffee & poached eggs 21 
(now that good arrives 22 i think 23 good arrives 
too late) 24 my compendium of losses i anticipate penning 
25 as i gather each trace of wronged breath26 a 
nesting starling arcs across 27 the path of walkers, flits 
into a bush 28 Pop's memory plays tricks 29 we 
are waiting in the hospital one minute 30 herding cows 
thru Arkansas grasslands the next 31 then i'm with him 
on the passenger's seat 32 as he tools moonlit avenues 
in the beige Hudson 33 conk-haired in pinstripes & broad 
lapels 34 rose pomade & another woman's lipstick 35 working 
down his high white collar 36 the garage door lifts 
to reveal his world 37 of India-inked bronze bombshells basking 
38 in bathing suits against the air-brushed palm-lined 39 beach 
while bug-eyed wolves in bow ties & zoots 40 flick 
apple-red tongues, flip wigs, jump out of their socks 41 
it's a scrambled brains 'n egg thang 42 hot kitchens 
& loud laughs 43 the bets coming so fast no 
one can count 44 the hot haughty high-chested moments 45 
when tan-toned promise flourished in smoke-toned niches 46 with a 
snap the spell lifts 47 pride shatters like a glass 
jaw 48 there's a stinging with each removal of a 
stitch 49 in this future we are both old if 
i am the elder. 50 Pop's long enwombed beneath that 
cheap beveled marble plaque 51 as black as my licorice 
heart
