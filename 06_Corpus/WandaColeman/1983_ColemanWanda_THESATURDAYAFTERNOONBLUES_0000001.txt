5 suicide hotline is busy 6 and here i am 
on my own 7 with a pill and a bottle 
for company 8 and heart full of been done wrong

a song 10 saturday afternoons are killers 11 when the 
air is brisk and warm 12 ol' sun he steady 
whispers 13 soon the life you know will be done

junky 21 the man i love is grief 22 some
