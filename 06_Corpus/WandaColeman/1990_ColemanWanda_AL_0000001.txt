1 i stole away those summer nights to lay up 
in his arms 2 and after deep drags on a 
joint to jazz masekela 3 his eyes would glaze over 
and i thought it was the high 4 his head 
moving in quick lyrical jerks to the sound 5 his 
gaze off soulwhere as i lay silent watching smoke rings 
6 wondering what he got out of marijuana and where 
the 7 music took him back or onward to perhaps 
that 8 west Texas mudhole wishing there was something 9 
i could do to liberate him from the pain 10 
i sensed under the smoke where i couldn't reach 11 
but felt we could fuck it away and sometimes we 
did. now 12 precisely at this moment i'm with him 
there twenty years ago the smoke the smell of hopelessness 
so pungent so 13 unforgettable how he'd turn those ominous 
eyes on me and 14 admonish 15 "babe, it's all 
bullcorn"
