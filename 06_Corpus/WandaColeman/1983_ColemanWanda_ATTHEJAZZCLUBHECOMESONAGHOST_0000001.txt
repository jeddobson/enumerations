1 remember? we were here once. love was a new 
cut 2 of meat, the sweat of fresh blood. into 
each other's eyes 3 falling. a closeness of breath. a 
toast. two glasses. reflection 4 his knee courting mine. and 
i thought wrong. thought maybe 5 flesh time. widowed sheets. 
a memory of a half flushed toilet. 6 the smell 
of him lingers just at the edge of my nose. 
a pressed 7 carnation stains the paper of our lives. 
pages to lock away 8 in a chest of disquiet 
9 where are they all now? the ones who listened 
so rapt to our 10 rhetoric? the spirits that mirrored 
my enthusiasm/lust for 11 adventure? 12 the window that promised 
escape in case the smoke became too 13 thick 14 
a prayer catches me unaware. religiosity is something other than 
15 dogma. the stink of our love losing potence between 
applications of 16 pine sol and i'm burning for him/bacon 
on a hot greasy grill 17 the singer sets a 
mood. what more can we do, we cemented in 18 
bond of 19 flesh, eager to get there, never tiring 
of the ritual: detergent and 20 bleach. the sun burning 
kisses on the tips of my fingers pressed 21 against 
22 safety glass. sometimes his touch comes through with the 
urgency of 23 a dying race: my heart beneath his 
shoe 24 we whispered overthrows, speculated on the egyptian book 
of the 25 dead 26 soul train and liberation. whatever 
happened to the brown-eyed 27 me, a mini-skirted wound weeping 
soft red candle light? she 28 reappears occasionally behind motel 
doors, takes her 29 lover's wallet while he sleeps and 
steals away
