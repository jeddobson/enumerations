1 eight years ago down the south end 2 Bloodsaw's 
barbershop and Jack-in-the-Box burger stop 3 so i'm back again 
4 and don't remember what used to be on the 
5 northeast Main Street corner 6 it's gas and service 
now. and on the corner 7 of 112th and San 
Pedro streets 8 i went to junior high in the 
early 60s9 i watch traffic struggle westward 10 under the 
warm cloudless July sky, the dog 11 ambling slowly along 
the old railroad tracks 12 no train has traveled this 
way in decades 13 i watch the little black girls 
go into the old corner market 14 twenty-five years ago. 
i watch their eager hands plunk down 15 two nickles 
on the counter. and i feel their pleasure as 16 
the old chinese mama fishes the giant dills from the 
17 barrel and places them in thin tissue wrappers 18 
i watch them leave the store, peel back the 19 
paper, the brine dripping to the sidewalk 20 they struggle 
to consume the salty treat 21 struggling with armfuls of 
books 22 in this neighborhood 23 who am i 24 
but the memory 25 of a slip that always hung 
26 in a time that did not fit27 it seems 
that just a minute ago 28 i was eight years 
down the south end 29 up on "Tobacco Road" it 
was called 30 with Cowboy and his Pop in that 
three-room shed 31 as we sat amidst rags piled floor 
to ceiling 32 as we sat on crates for chairs 
33 and Cowboy and his Pop consumed the short dog 
34 Cowboy was showing me off 35 he had high 
ambitions. was gonna 36 take me to wife 37 was 
gonna give me something 38 besides a good sexin' 39 
but there was nothing to give 40 but the crystal 
brown whiskey 41 and the dirty shed and piles of 
old clothes 42 and his horse 43 riding me up 
and down 120th street 44 with his brothers and cousins 
45 causing a stir in the neighborhood 46 and the 
meager promise 47 of rodeo winnings 48 and maybe a 
shed like this only better 49 in Perris, California 50 
where the sun never sets 51 and black cowboys go 
52 to die with holes in their boots
