1 a stunned audience silent as 4 AM avenues 2 
i walk home alone 3 in the still awesome morn's 
cold 4 climb dark steep stained gold carpeted stairs 5 
to more silence graced by 6 dream breath of children, 
the 7 hum of the refrigerator's stubborn motor 8 and 
restless ghosts 9 where is he 10 why isn't he 
here 11 i have answers/memories/regrets 12 madness 13 i have 
14 iced sheets. 2 pillows. slow jazz knife into my 
heart 15 i have 16 a bottle full of wine. 
coke in a thin crisp envelope 17 and marijuana 18 
where are you 19 why aren't you here 20 i 
have a book. a tv program. a pen 21 the 
phone numbers of friends 22 mother and brothers 23 once 
upon a time his hands guide me thru hallways 24 
talks sweet nothings maybes forevers 25 our eyes cathedral wide 
26 he rolls the smoke, fires it, puts it to 
my lips 27 a toke, we kiss, he fires me 
28 once upon his hands in my blouse finds nipples 
29 his hands in my jeans finds wet 30 my 
tongue in his ear whispers. my hands in his 31 
slacks finds firm welcome 32 once into each other 33 
it was all right 34 mr. & mrs. lost & 
found 35 we spoke the same tongue 36 after our 
poem 37 the world was bearable
