1 i remember you the way one remembers a bad 
meal. this 2 evening you belched up from the memory 
of a thirteen- 3 year-old black girl whose friends were 
either misfits 4 like herself or belonged to another race 
5 i liked you very much luz 6 enough to 
maintain our limited friendship though i knew 7 you liked 
me less. i was fat, ugly, outcast. the glint 8 
in your eye that hunger that drew me to you 
9 was my hunger also 10 you spoke spanish 11 
used to teach me some and introduce me to your 
culture, 12 food, ways. i knew nothing of illegal aliens 
but understood 13 your poverty went deeper than mine. yes, 
the dimes. i let 14 you steal them from me 
15 you put me down 16 that was okay, for 
there was that to which you aspired/the 17 whiteness of 
the white world/a door closed and 18 bolted to me. 
you entered. i remained outside 19 this night i see 
your eyes 20 as clear as if you were here 
now, your full girlish figure 21 (i had none) was 
my envy and has probably 22 gone to fat with 
many babies or 23 to dust after many trials. oh 
luz, i had so many things 24 to say---so many 
tight chic referrals to the 25 latin-black conflicts over white 
socio-eco crumbs 26 i wanted to say them through you 
27 all i do is remember, think of us/our people 
as we were 28 or could have been---apart, the awful 
silence 29 together, the awesome storm
