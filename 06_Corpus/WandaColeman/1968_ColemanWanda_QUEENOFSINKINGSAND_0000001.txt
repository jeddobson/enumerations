depths love/loyalty 3 my eyes fastened to the promise 4 
above the angry roar of wind 5 he is there. 
she is there 6 how long, exorcism? 7 my head 
on plaid clad pillows 8 yellow roses dying/drying in rush 
of heat-gas 9 the dead man on bass guitar---a prophet 
10 no. i do not want to stay young forever 
11 his hand in mine tightly clasps 12 needy fingers. 
he is slipping fast. i can't hold on 13 i 
plunge into her womb/mouth 14 suicide by angel dust illusion 
15 throat fire 16 vision: her running out in front 
of the car 17 headlights. scream of brakes. curses 18 
of the shaken driver 19 her plea for help choked 
in exhaust 20 please let go of me 21 i 
see him/profuse beard and 22 eye and black flesh---hoodoo of 
street wisdom 23 conjure of pool hustle, my heart thump-thump 
24 "to your knees bitch!" 25 and i fall. rug 
burns and 26 mouth open to receive the scepter
