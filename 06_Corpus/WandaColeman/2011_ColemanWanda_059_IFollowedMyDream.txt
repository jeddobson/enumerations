it took me out of nothing and into the world.

it led me in circles within circles.

it took me down endless phosphorescent hallways

and pitted asphalt alleys.

it left my drawers open and vulnerable to thieves

who appropriated my

plot ideas and skivvies.

it left my heart open to repetitive breakage.

at the end of it was a man who told me that supporting me

was an act of forced labor.

at the end of it there were creditors and tax examiners.

at the end of it there were missing letters and callers who

hung up without speaking.

at the end of it were distortions, lies, misunderstandings,

omissions, and gray-hearted boyfriends.

at the end of it were sniggering enemies.

at the end of it was one son's death.

at the end of it was a so-called friend who admonished me

for my rage and said

i should be satisfied with nothing.

at the end of it were strangers who stared at me without

empathy and told me i was nothing.

at the end of it was a man who loved me down to nothing.

at the end of it was nothing.
