1 dearest cousin, 2 upon my sword, it seems i've 
abandoned the concrete 3 for the flower, the street for 
the tower. i feel as 4 if i've spent the 
last five hundred years 5 picking cotton without pay or 
shade. my soul remains the 6 slave and i am 
shackled to the stone of my inextinguishable 7 grief. i 
rue my own bleeding maw. if only 8 there were 
some escape from this dark dreary flesh. in it, 9 
i am denied the beauty of effective discourse, the fruit 
of 10 intellectual ascension. instead, i wallow 11 in the 
mundane routine of ceaseless doings. but for my 12 children, 
i strive to conceal such anxious and indulgent 13 examinations. 
i suspect i am being consumed 14 by some mysterious 
fatigue and fear of the truth drives 15 me to 
abstractions. i loathe and curse the terrible 16 scribe quilling 
this loonytoon history
