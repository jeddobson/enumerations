1 a friend and i were discussing the local scarcity 
2 of decent apartments yet the abundance 3 of high-priced 
hell-holes. she complained the only 4 good ones at reasonable 
rates are units in which 5 the occupant has died 
of the virus 6 occasionally we hear what sounds like 
footsteps 7 on the ceiling. the joke is "it's the 
ghost" 8 until we remember the guy who lived here 
before us 9 he died of the virus 10 it 
is because of this, we suspect, we were able 11 
to rent so quickly and easily 12 without a credit 
check 13 a friend & traveler says they're beginning to 
deny visas 14 to residents of 15 Los Angeles, New 
York and San Francisco 16 i was working/struggling to concentrate, 
depressed 17 about money madness when my matters were 18 
interrupted by the crescendoing hallelujahs of 19 Handel's Messiah issuing 
vigorously from 20 my neighbor's stereo. it is 21 rumored 
he has the virus
