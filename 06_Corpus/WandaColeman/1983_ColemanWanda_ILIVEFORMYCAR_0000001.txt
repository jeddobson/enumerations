1 can't let go of it. to live is to 
drive. to have it function 2 smooth, flawless. to rise 
with morning and have it start 3 i pray to 
the mechanic for heat again and air conditioning 4 when 
i meet people i used to know i'm glad to 
see them until 5 i remember what i'm driving and 
am afraid they'll go outside and 6 see me climb 
into that struggle buggy and laugh deep long loud 7 
i've become very proficient at keeping my car running. i 
8 visit service stations and repair shops often which is 
why 9 i haven't a coat to wear or nice 
clothes or enough money each 10 month to pay the 
rent. i don't like my car to be dirty. i 
spend 11 saturday mornings scrubbing it down. i've promised it 
a new 12 bumper 13 and a paint job. luckily 
this year i was able to pay registration 14 i 
dream that my car is transformed into a stylish 15 
convertible and i'm riding along happily beneath sun glasses 16 
the desert wind kissing my face my man beside me. 
we smile 17 we are very beautiful. sometimes the dreams 
become nightmares 18 i'm careening into an intersection the kids 
in the back seat scream 19 "mama!" i mash down 
on the brake. the pedal goes to the floor 20 
i have frequent fantasies about running over people i don't 
like 21 with my car 22 my car's an absolute 
necessity in this city of cars where 23 you come 
to know people best by how they maneuver on the 
24 freeway 25 make lane changes or handle off-ramps. i've 
promised myself 26 i will one day own a luxury 
model. it'll be something 27 i can leave my children. 
till then i'm on spark plugs and lug nuts 28 
keeping the one i have mobile. i live for it. 
can't let go of it 29 to drive is to 
live
