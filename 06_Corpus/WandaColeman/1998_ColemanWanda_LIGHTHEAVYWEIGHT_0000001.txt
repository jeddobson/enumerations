1 before boxing quit him, Papa was a golden gloved 
2 comer with a solid left hook and lightning 3 
foot-and-shoulder work. never seriously hurt 4 he once sustained a 
broken nose, 5 which accentuated its broad Bantu flatness. 6 
someone said it was a glass jaw, to recall rumor, 
7 one knockdown too many, or a cauliflower heart 8 
though i suspect the gangsters ran him out 9 of 
the fight game. for certain, Auntie and Mama 10 pleaded 
themselves into ring-widow despair. 11 when asked, Papa confessed, "the 
headaches." 12 when the throbs came on, his tormented roar 
13 stiffened and stilled us in our shadows, he tore 
14 from room to room, smashing his palms 15 to 
his scalp clawing to snatch that sledge hammer 16 slamming 
his reason, Mama in his trail, crying, 17 "George! George!" 
her hands stroked the air in their 18 empty reach, 
waved plaintively before her high heavy bosom 19 until the 
fury waned and he lowered his head 20 and gave 
over to her motherings. 21 fisticuffs would not be the 
way 22 Mama pulled Papa into bed where he KO'd 
the pillows 23 and dreamed of title belts and bells 
clanging comeback. 24 months fled before he would cease those 
restless 25 risings at bronze sun-ups to sprint miles of 
blocks, jump 26 rhythm rope to the stop-clock and sock 
the black leather 27 punching bag until its senseless seams 
split, the steel 28 bolt splintered and the hope bled 
from busted knuckles
