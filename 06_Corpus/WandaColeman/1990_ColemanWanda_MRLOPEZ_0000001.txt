1 in german class they used to laugh behind his 
back 2 even his best pupils 3 but i liked 
to think i was his best pupil 4 and i 
didn't laugh 5 "why do you laugh at him" i 
once asked 6 and got no answer 7 perhaps it 
was his glasses. they were thick lensed 8 what we 
kids called "coke bottles" 9 or his black hair cut 
in a quarter-inch butch making 10 each shiny strand stand 
at absolute attention 11 or his crackling white shirts and 
severe neatness 12 or his manner. he was tough, daring 
us to 13 act up in his presence 14 like 
a sergeant "in the gestapo" they smirked 15 but i 
saw a sincere man 16 who loved the german tongue 
as i was learning 17 to love it. so what 
18 if his manner was militant, his walk a goose-step 
19 "you've got a crush on him" they said 20 
but that was not so. i respected him as an 
21 excellent teacher 22 "but how can you" they laughed 
at me 23 "it's all so funny! what do you 
think this is ?" 24 one day late in the 
semester 25 i asked the boy next to me, "what's 
so funny? 26 why do they laugh at him all 
the time" 27 "because he's a mexican." 28 i looked 
at him blankly. "don't you get it? 29 we're all 
blacks and here we are in german class 30 with 
a mexican for a teacher" 31 but at that time 
i was too dense 32 to get the joke
