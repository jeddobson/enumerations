1 after the long day's hustle, Papa returned 2 home 
waving fistfuls of Tootsie Rolls, wolfed down 3 his supper, 
changed from his suit into his long-sleeved 4 gray coveralls 
or blue cotton smock and slid out of 5 silky 
stockings and Italian leather loafers into white 6 cotton socks 
and well-scuffed All-American work shoes 7 for his night shift 
scrubbing and waxing corporation floors 8 we missed his loud 
full laughter 9 around the television and what company we 
had 10 wasn't as interesting as the visitors 11 who 
came through when he hung around home 12 but we 
trusted Papa was doing his best 13 to become "healthy, 
wealthy and wise" 14 without shame over shameful wages---enough 15 
indian head nickels to finance a scheme 16 (the men 
he worked graveyard with 17 always became buddies 18 and 
no matter whose car broke down, 19 there was always 
a ride to or from home 20 or a spot 
until pay day) 21 one night Mama had an emergency. 
she 22 bundled us into a cab and took us 
down to 23 the building and knocked on the glass 
until 24 Papa opened the door. he carried us inside 
25 where, in jammies, robes, and slippers, we 26 curled 
up in blankets on a mahogany desk 27 in that 
giant office. then we watched Papa run 28 the long 
dustbroom across the black-and-white 29 squares of linoleum, our lids 
drooping to 30 a close as he rolled in a 
giant pail of 31 hot sudsy water and began to 
sling the 32 industrial mop, singing low Old Man River 
33 at sunrise, we woke as he deposited us, one 
34 child to a shoulder, onto the back seat 35 
of the Pontiac for our dreamlike journey home 36 but 
first stop---sinkers, hot chocolate and smiles
