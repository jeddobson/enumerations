bird destinations—weeks and months fly

moments ooze/a choked flow like waste water

affluent through Texas marshland

the pursuit of oil & science translates into

transplant allocations: single occupant apartment

with view onto sand dunes and dirty brown/off-white sand,

and water the color of an abandoned roan

if you take all the stereotypes—designer bikinis, campus

hijinks, riding sidesaddle on the beach,

neighbors yelling in some unidentifiable tongue,

the woman upceiling, who chronically drops-and-rolls

the same mysterious object on those cold muggy

afternoons—and lug them onto an island

(like it's a spittoon)—

you have the Paris of mosquitoes

toward the end of May, hearts, wallets, and the sky warm

biking? more's the pleasure, or a VW microbus

light blue observed leaving tread on unfinished asphalt,

walks beachside, taking in the tourists.

some call it Podunk, population never enough

it grew on her anyway

as much as she wanted to hate it
