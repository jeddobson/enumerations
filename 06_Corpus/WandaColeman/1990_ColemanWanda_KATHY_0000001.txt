1 cold? no i'm not cold. it's not the wind. 
it's that damned cat! 2 there was the time i 
visited her in the women's facilities. 3 she had been 
incarcerated six months. 4 his ghost. she told me she 
saw his ghost. he 5 came to her cell. i 
knew that things were coming to an 6 end but 
couldn't let go. i should've walked away 7 and said, 
"fuck it." another niggah bites dust 8 their love was 
ugly. forced, stilted, ugly. even their child 9 was ugly. 
it was ironic. he died bickering over the 10 ugliness/their 
love. a child. abandoned to its half-black 11 half-amerindian grandmother 
the whore 12 in blythe somewheres to grow up hating 
men just 13 like her mother. tricking them into dead 
end streets and 14 empty wallets. i should've turned away, 
closed the door 15 but she was my friend 16 
no. i'm not cold 17 county jail visits. glass wall 
between us/her 18 wig for appearances, in thigh-high ill-fitting slammer 
dress. 19 left messages and took messages and left money 
and tried 20 to give encouragement. surely a year was 
easy time to do. 21 she 22 could concentrate on 
art work. i'd visit the foster home 23 and she 
should stop thinking about god punishing her. 24 she killed 
him over the baby 25 at her trial the cops 
testified she showed no remorse. i 26 remembered that later 
when i saw her face to my face 27 the 
day she killed me or saved me depending on how 
one 28 looks at it. 29 that ugly baby crying 
while me she and he tore up that 30 raggedy-ass 
house, fighting. i told her, for the first time, 31 
how bloody fucking ugly in the face she was 32 
please, don't close the window 33 we will meet again 
is carved into my flesh, a scar i carry 34 
beneath this mantle, testimony to an event history will 35 
never betray except for that ugly child still living to 
36 reproduce herself across the head of some unsuspecting john 
37 in some sleazy motel room this side of the 
38 twenty-first century. her legacy, a cheap shot shake-a-booty 39 
jumping and grinding in hollywood's pits 40 when you see 
me shudder and shiver it's not the chill of 41 
late night air it's probably the memory 42 twisting around 
in my brain or some radio 43 tune in my 
ear conjuring up the corpse of her and her man 
44 ---the one she wasted with a saturday night special---of 
her 45 dancing to the boop-boop-ada-boop of soul while he 
and 46 me sat around taking drags off a joint 
47 unmindful of tomorrow 48 no. i'm not cold 49 
it's that damned cat is what it is, crossing my 
grave
