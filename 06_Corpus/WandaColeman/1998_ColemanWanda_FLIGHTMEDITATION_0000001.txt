1 when heart people are 2 cope-aesthetic 3 we sometimes 
love ourselves 4 laugh out loud & touch shoulders 5 
about sad/courageous acts 6 sometimes we fight & live 7 
these the things we ofttimes do 8 & when alone 
i sometimes stare 9 from wall to sky 10 creating 
visions of heroes fighting 11 for me & my side 
winning for a change 12 & me winning. & i 
find 13 myself bloody against the cement 14 dodging fists 
& i can't say 15 for certain who i have 
loved 16 or have been loved by 17 it is 
the fear of summer's passing 18 winter's killing what love 
has 19 done & what i have loved for 20 
the doing & i am on my knees praying 21 
hit it a lick lady, you're in it up to 
your naps 22 & the soul-eaters snake 23 like thieves 
on the throne 24 mass producing beautiful 25 heartless corpses 
& then stealing 26 them away while my frequent rebirth 
27 shocks me out of somnambulance 28 & i'm burning 
long oil & 29 skimping on rest & wailing 30 
my time, my time, where is my time?
