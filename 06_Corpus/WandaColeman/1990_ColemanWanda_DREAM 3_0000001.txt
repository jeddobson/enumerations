1 the trip starts on the limitless freeway of my 
thoughts. the 2 tank is full. i am behind the 
wheel moving with undisturbed 3 swiftness. i feel the sigh 
of the engine, emanations through 4 the floor, my foot 
against the accelerator rises and falls as i 5 pass 
first on the left then on the right, swooping. lights 
6 bobble in the fluid ink of night, amber, white 
and red street 7 stars. there is other life out 
there. i sense it, a smell, a 8 heat rising 
from my skin. i'm hugged in my black leather 9 
jacket a perfect fit and fingerless black calfskin gloves. my 
10 black kinks porcupine my scalp thickly, wild. my ears 
are 11 clamped in gold. my big hips hug the 
contoured seat and i 12 reach for the fake gearshift 
(because this vehicle really has 13 an automatic transmission) and 
i'm flying as the speedometer 14 needle presses urgently against 
the edge. ah---the power. i 15 am looking for the 
answer. and i move forward, my eyes 16 scoping the 
horizon as though a pinball course and i know 17 
he's out here somewhere dead ahead enemy and lover. i 
am armed, 18 the beretta snug in the confines of 
my jacket. i think briefly 19 of the law. what 
if they give chase. but i've outrun them 20 before. 
21 i did not wake up today
