1 i went to the psychiatrist and i explained to 
him that every 2 one i saw had two heads. 
that all people in my eyes were 3 like the 
classic two-headed dragon. that two round projectiles 4 occupied the 
space that rose from the neck, head up 5 and 
i saw them---one regular head and the other demon 6 
head and that no matter how hard i tried to 
shine the demon 7 head 8 on, it was the 
one that usually made the more interesting 9 conversationalist, appeared 
less hypocritical and said the 10 most fascinating things and 
scared the shit out of me in 11 general. i 
needed help. i didn't want to be institutionalized 12 because 
i didn't feel that that was necessary for my condition 
13 i was yet to become violent or attempt to 
strangle 14 lop off or mutilate any of these heads. 
i merely tried to 15 treat them as i would 
treat any head at all 16 the doctor was a 
kind man, though not quite understanding 17 and 18 suggested 
that i could be helped over a period of six 
19 months or a year if i'd only sign some 
papers 20 his demon head turned out to be an 
even better doctor 21 told me to go home and 
study a mirror
