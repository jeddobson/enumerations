1 i sit and stare at the room 2 my 
hope used to bunk there. and my joy too. and 
3 everything i thought good. my faith. my continuance. 4 
my other self. myself in selves. my laughter also had 
a 5 corner of that room. small little space it 
held so much--- 6 the enormity of my thriving/beauty kept 
selfishly 7 secret from all but a few 8 now. 
oh how empty, room. 9 a tortured gap. my desires 
removed/old useless 10 furniture. greedy hands have left their prints 
in the 11 dust and on the walls 12 (did 
i have all that. did i smile. did i feel 
safe? 13 did i admire leaves of bougainvillea growing at 
the window 14 did i lose the onus of skin 
in a scent of fame. did i move 15 with 
grace in his arms. did i share a sweet sorrow 
with 16 her. did i dance before an audience of 
lovers?) 17 i did a cradle crow 18 i did 
a hush-a-bye 19 did and i did woo night favors 
and seduced an ode 20 the room. too still. its 
music 21 stilled. there are bits and pieces of melodrama 
22 left clinging in the filthy orange rug 23 mildew 
denial and lies
