1 we suffer heat 2 lying down 3 too sapped 
to move 4 locked in by sun 5 and empty 
pockets 6 words come 7 explosions or not at all 
8 we're at each other 9 can't touch 10 the 
skin sticks 11 baking 12 this oven of ancient wood 
and 13 no ventilation 14 the fan hums 15 unkept 
promise 16 we'd rather be elsewhere 17 he finds his 
way out 18 i'm stuck here 19 with the children 
20 the television 21 too hot to complain 22 too 
whipped for anger 23 wish there was something else 24 
i could take off
