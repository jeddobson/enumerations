1 last night i saw another you 2 at a 
poetry reading 3 and got a chill 4 a lot 
of tall lean young men with southern drawls 5 hunched 
into "hard" life 6 cursing cunts and flirting with homosexuality 
7 or the needle 8 a new breed of gutsy 
alliteration 9 who spit in your ear about "real" life 
10 and the sons-of-bitches making it 11 hell--- shit ---heaven---anything 
but purgatory 12 and i thought, "there must be a 
school of them" 13 like marlin in the waters of 
this generation 14 hot in the wake of yours 15 
snapping at fame's bait 16 hungry for the hook 17 
yet wrestling to be free, once caught 18 and this 
one, this spare white brown-haired 19 son-of-a-texas sea bass seemed 
to be going slack on the line 20 he reeled 
on the stage/page 21 drunk with beer and expectation 22 
flopped through his poems like some 23 dying water baby 
on the sand 24 the audience was amused and enjoyed 
him 25 because he was good and because we'd seen 
26 his act before and it is funny 27 i 
shook his hand and departed laughing 28 i once played 
the part of cursed black cunt to 29 one of 
your carbons with a tennessee walk 30 who's managed to 
do quite well on paper 31 almost as good as 
you---except 32 he loves beer too much to commit suicide
