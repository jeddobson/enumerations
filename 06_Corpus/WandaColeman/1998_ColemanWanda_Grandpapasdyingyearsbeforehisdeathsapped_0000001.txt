1 Grandpapa's dying years before his death sapped 2 his 
spawn and drew Mammon's wrath, the wasted spill 3 stained 
a dowry's agririches, oiled coffers of the state 4 his 
legacy? 5 by bleakness born and fondled in confusion's storm 
6 cold hands of memory blue those red-hot strokes off 
7 palm-lined coasts of longing's sweet ago, his scar and 
8 stubble a lover's love spurs my nature even as 
9 i sleep to the lullsome clang of the usurer's 
purse 10 my son's pale lust-drowned flesh contains the fare 
of 11 another's wrongful godfilled stare and there his wraith-thin 
12 corpse intrudes, a milk-white stone of bone 13 chained 
and hung to thump alee my star-shocked heart 14 to 
the far-off jeer of the world whorling wild
