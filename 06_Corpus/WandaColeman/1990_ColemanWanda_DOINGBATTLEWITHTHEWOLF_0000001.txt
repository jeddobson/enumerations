who eats even the mind 19 the wolf will come 
for me sooner or later 20 i know this 21

and 24 frequently hunts with his mate along side him 
25 he follows my trail of blood 26 i drip 
blood for hours 27 go to the bathroom and apply 
bandages 28 i've bled enough 29 it's my monthly bleeding 
of poison 30 getting it out of my system 31

of my body into the toilet stool 33 making a 
red ring 34 so pretty 35 flushing it away---red swirls 
36 a precious painful price i pay 37 my man 
cannot protect me 38 the wolf has devoured most of 
my friends 39 i watched them die horribly 40 saw 
the 41 raw hunks of meat skin bone 42 swallowed 
43 watched as full, the wolf crept away 44 to 
sleep45 the wolf has a beautiful coat 46 it is 
white and shimmers in moonlight/a coat of diamonds 47 his 
jaws are power 48 teeth sharp as guns glisten against 
his red tongue 49 down around his feet the fur 
is dirty with the caked blood 50 of my friends

father 66 (who was a runaway slave) as he from 
his mother (who 67 married the tribal witch doctor)---me---african warrior 
68 imprisoned inside my female form 69 determined 70 i

the spear 74 against his head 75 he falls back
