1 Daddyboy squeezed the joy into us when he tossed 
2 us within a hand's tap of our cool peach-toned 
ceiling 3 then caught us by the waist as we 
dropped, 4 but gitty-up-horsey was our favorite daddy game, 5 
fighting each other for first mount across 6 his broad 
glistening honeybrown back, kicking 7 heels as he'd break his 
workout routine 8 to gallop hands-and-knees across the living room 
9 floor to the dining room. Mommygirl would take a 
beat, peek 10 out from the kitchen-way, smiling, hands to 
hip and apron, 11 then she'd go back to dinner 
duty. our biggest thrill 12 was when he lifted his 
right foot, massive torso, 13 and began to rise from 
the floor, grasping the childrider 14 firmly by leg, easing 
into a canter out the front door, 15 across the 
porch, off at a clip down 89th Street to the 
envy 16 of neighbor kids who wished their dads were 
boxer strong 17 so they could fly piggyback under the 
evergreens, 18 hands to his neck and jaw, hanging on 
for dear love
