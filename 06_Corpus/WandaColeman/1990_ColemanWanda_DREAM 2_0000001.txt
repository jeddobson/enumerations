1 eagle gives birth to serpent 2 serpent consumes eagle 
3 eagle eats thru and exits serpent 4 serpent expires 
and sustains eagle 5 DREAM 731 6 my hair in 
braids, i am dressed in a cloth of rainbow 7 
i lay in a trance on a bed of pine 
which is covered 8 with a rainbow quilt. the bed 
is in a corner near 9 the fireplace in the 
one room of a log cabin. the cabin 10 sits 
atop the rainbow mesa. against the purple sky 11 i 
see rays of emerging sun. an eagle descends thru an 
12 open window at the foot of the bed. i 
rise to receive 13 him. he plucks three sacred feathers 
from this his 14 incarnation. they too are of rainbow. 
he places them in 15 my cupped palms then flies 
away. i am taken by a nameless 16 joy. holding 
the feathers to my heart, i wake up 17 singing 
in an unfamiliar tongue
