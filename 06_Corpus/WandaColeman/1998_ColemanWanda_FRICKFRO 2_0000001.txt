1 smell the sweat & suede of the tapdaddies swilling 
2 skidrow gin & bitter lime, and tonk-THAT-muthafucka 3 in 
praise of liver & onions served on cracked blue plates 
4 by two-toned beauties who hail from those lost kingdoms 
5 south of the Mason-Dixon line on this night approaching 
6 like Armageddon in a half-pint 7 hit that ill-lit 
pipe offering up delusions of 8 fiscal responsibility and shudder 
as dawn 9 kisses the drawn lids of eyes too 
heavily entranced 10 to be shocked at the machetes amputating 
extremities 11 ambitiously running rivers of patriotic blood 12 ooooo. 
come again 13 as the sluggishness of a spent desire 
subsides 14 like the revolt of vexed government employees unqualified 
15 to do much more than stamp-and-pass or hiss-and-piss 16 
while wallowing in the certainty of retirement funds 17 and 
municipal bonds as they contaminate the air with "no" 18 
(brooding superstitious posers doing the bellyflop 19 in praise of 
the death zone they enter) 20 that we soothspillers may 
21 rise from the homicidal funk 22 anointed in bullfat 
& hemp oil 23 word-warriors snake dancing in the drum
