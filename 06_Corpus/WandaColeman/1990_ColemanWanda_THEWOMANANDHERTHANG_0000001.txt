1 she kept it in a black green felt-lined box 
2 liked to bring it out to show people, especially 
the men 3 she was sexually involved with 4 it 
was a creature she loved 5 sometimes when she was 
alone, she'd take it from its box 6 caress it 
gently, lay it on the bed, watch 7 it glide 
easily over the blanket 8 frequently she would feed it 
a mouse or small rabbit and watch 9 for days, 
until the lump in its torso dissolved 10 it was 
more than a pet 11 of course, she never saw 
herself in it 12 she felt she had so many 
more dimensions 13 she was warm and it was cold 
14 people loved her but they were afraid of it 
15 the only thing they shared was a blackness of 
skin 16 and a certain rhythmic motion 17 one day 
she was showing it to this man 18 a very 
special man 19 a man she wanted to fall in 
love with who 20 seemed to be able to love 
her, a man different from 21 the other black men 
she had known 22 and so she opened the black 
green felt box 23 reached in and took it out 
24 gently she carried it over to the bed 25 
where he lay naked and waiting 26 she showed it 
to him proudly 27 he was appalled, shocked, frightened 28 
he jumped. he scared it. 29 it took a long 
time for that lump to go away 30 many times 
since she has considered getting rid of it 31 but 
after having invested so much time in the thang 32 
she couldn't bear to throw it away 33 a friend 
suggested she sell it 34 she's into that process now.
