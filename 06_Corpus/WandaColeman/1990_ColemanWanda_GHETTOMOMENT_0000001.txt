1 he's there, sits very still barely breathing waiting for 
my 2 reaction to his intrusion into my life ... 
waiting to make 3 me fall in love ... 4 
dark room with roses---a few petals fallen against the 5 
hardwood table---a few on the rug. heavy drapes and stale 
6 air. i am old, and this ghost persists in 
haunting ... a 7 black lady with memories of many 
lovers ... 8 tomorrow's diary, today 9 and he is 
there behind the old chair, his cobwebs fresh and 10 
spidery---touches me from his grave---a notebook full of 11 clippings 
and crypt worms 12 oh auntie, what were they like 
and why did they leave you? 13 she pats me 
on the head. i slip away, my jump rope trails 
14 behind me. in the garden, fresh roses and sunlit 
rooms--- 15 a passel of young boys
