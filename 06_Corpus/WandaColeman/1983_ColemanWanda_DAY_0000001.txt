1 dead white chill hand of the waker dispels dreams 
2 brings horror 3 no i do not want to 
go out 4 winter awaits me in the light 5 
it skitters. it booms. it knocks down 6 invades 7 
slithers beneath the windows, tries to get in 8 surrounds 
9 just outside pressed against dusty louvers 10 still. hulking. 
shimmery 11 i know it's there 12 a thing hungry 
icy cold cruel 13 a blast of arctic air that 
sears skin 14 the spiral mouth time sucks up years 
15 howling phrenetic terrible 16 a dying wail 17 i 
hide from it here in the dark 18 shades drawn, 
tensed
