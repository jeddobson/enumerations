storms in mirrors hidden—the wisdom of duality

the woman born whole casts her body into the radiant void

between disdain and desire,

becomes ebony pearl tossed back

by swine. she lifts her chin her skirt her bootstraps

she grows the eyes of an owl

and a hawk's talons, her tongue's

(smells like baby oil and pressed hair

the color of summer ’58)

might may silence a man or bring him to his beggin' knees

to worship to perish. her rages

give birth to phallic dramas. goddess

in her musings. she has forgotten more about being human

than all time's philosophers

will ever surmise
