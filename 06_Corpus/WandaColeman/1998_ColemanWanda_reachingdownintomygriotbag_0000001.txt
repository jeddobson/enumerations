1 reaching down into my griot bag 2 of womanish 
wisdom and wily 3 social commentary, i come up with 
bricks 4 with which to either reconstruct 5 the past 
or deconstruct a head. dolor 6 robs me of art's 
coin 7 as i push, for peanuts, to level walls 
and 8 rebuild the ruins of my poetic promise. from 
9 the infinite alphabet of afroblues 10 intertwinings, i cull 
apocalyptic visions 11 (the details and lovers entirely real) 12 
and articulate my voyage beyond that 13 point where self 
disappears 14 mis violentas flores negras 15 these are my 
slave songs
