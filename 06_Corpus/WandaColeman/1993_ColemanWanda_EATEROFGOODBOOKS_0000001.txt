1 each word each syllable 2 repast 3 at the 
table i am alone 4 they will come sit here 
many times 5 i will never be quite here again 
6 flanked left and right yet alone 7 at the 
table 8 eating hale yet tasting nothing but tart ripe 
bitterness 9 my own meat its deepening blackness though 10

of solitude 31 and the streets that gave me shape 
have been long 32 torn up, repaved) 33 i am 
sick and starved to death among the resonance of 34 
rhythms i will never taste again (which is why i'm 
35 always reluctant to brush after meals) 36 fat on 
the rich yet unfulfilling
