1 i wake him angry at 6 a.m. i scream, 
"why'd you 2 steal the kid's money? what'd you do 
with it?" 3 he denies it. comes all the way 
woke. i 4 tremble with anger tell him he's 5 
got to get out. we can't live like this 6 
can't breathe in this ugly 7 and there's nothing in 
his face 8 nothing to nail my hope on 9 
and he says for the umpteenth time 10 "i didn't 
take it" 11 "don't tell me that shit don't tell 
me 12 that shit" i repeat and salivate, my fists 
13 clenched i take a step toward him. "i'm this 
far 14 from jumpin' into your ass" i threaten 15 
and he takes a step back. the stirrings of 16 
the kids interrupt and it's a gruesome truce over 17 
coffee. i know it's only a matter of days 18 
before he's gone for good
