1 they could be heard thru the walls 2 making 
commotion 3 he'd stick his button in her face 4 
and she'd nail it with a sledgehammer 5 or she'd 
come in tired and depressed 6 and he'd start workin' 
her nerves or start 7 to pitch and whine and 
she'd resent his childish 8 display and refuse a motherly 
response 9 evoking his instant anger and 10 recollection of 
similar mistreatment by another 11 ex-past arousing her ire she's 
sick of being constantly 12 compared against the fluctuating vista 
of old fucks 13 then he stabs her a second 
time before the first 14 wound bleeds 15 now they're 
beating dead metaphors 16 and slinging choice epithets and if 
he touches 17 her she's gonna destroy the one thing 
he regards 18 as precious and he restrains his fist 
threatens to 19 leave her because hasn't she seen her 
body lately 20 and other women look at him constantly 
21 she invites him to go on out there and 
22 get whatevah crotch-rot they's givin' up these days 23 
and stymied he hugs it in and exits to her 
screams 24 curtaining the wall between them as he slams 
the door
