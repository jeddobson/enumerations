1 coming here the last time i thought 2 i'd 
got it right. here's yet another effort 3 after rising. 
the concept of being brought down 4 and having to 
struggle to rise again 5 a well-examined hurt still hurts 
until the healing 6 takes. (one not of Assisi) 7 
the exactitude with which the same story is told 8 
with the overly familiar precise mouthings and weary 9 emphases 
only vaguely related to the established point 10 intrusive on 
an evolving dialogue which might have 11 concluded in arousing 
satori but is instead 12 truncated by the tired reminiscence 
of something 13 banal and extraneous 14 the impatient ego 
which deftly assumes 15 anticipates then undermines one less glib 
16 boredom---the inability to appreciate the 17 subtle aesthetics of 
deep tight layering 18 in this dizzy instance i am 
absolutely still 19 while the world woogies round me 20 
how many stabs before i pierce his skull?
