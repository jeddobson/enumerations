complications like heroin abuse 13 some of them are very 
young 14 most of them have brief charts 15 which 
means they died within a year of beginning 16 treatment 
17 sometimes a patient gets worried about his or her 
18 coverage and calls the office 19 i refer them 
to the dialysis unit caseworker 20 a few of the 
patients do bad things. for instance 21 some of them 
might refuse treatment as scheduled 22 sometimes they get drunk 
and call up 23 the nurses or attendants and curse 
them out 24 sometimes they try to fight the attendants 
25 because they feel neglected/afraid 26 sometimes they wait until 
the last minute 27 to show up and it is 
the last minute 28 most of the patients, good patients, 
29 quietly expire 30 i retire their charts to the 
inactive file 31 a few more claims i won't be

black, latin or poor 33 i make out crisp new 
charts 34 and the process starts all over again 35 
the cash flows and flows and flows 36 so that 
the doctors can feed their racehorses 37 and play tennis
