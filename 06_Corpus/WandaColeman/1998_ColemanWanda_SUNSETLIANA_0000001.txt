1 midnight jazz & indigo 2 she dwells in the 
heat of a lover's burn, 3 what she does is 
not a crime. it's 4 not her fault 5 the 
bad hours, the wake-depraved eyes 6 red as emergency lights 
7 the thoughts as violent as piercing as sirens 8 
hers is a world of incantations, 9 scented candles & 
Abyssinian musk, 10 fertile with marriages & births. spells 11 
are cast in the sway of her shadow 12 she 
anoints with vintage sirah 13 pours fragrant oils into a 
crystal glove 14 there are answers in her closet, 15 
a velvet scarf smells of too-ripe rose 16 a sable 
fur is passion-torn 17 a thin silken gown is the 
color of dew 18 in a chocolate tin, the ash 
of cold romance 19 turns platinum & gold 20 her 
men 21 always discover they're hooked. long after 22 it's 
too late. long after she's vanished. 23 there's no cure 
for her. 24 they will escape their wives, don shades 
& 25 black leather, drive endless neon-charged 26 boulevards, search 
phone booths & unlit doorways, 27 suffer emptiness to rhythm 
& ruin, 28 pine in forsaken dens on the derelict 
fringe, 29 itch in vain. she's habit. 30 no man 
can kick. 31 not now. not in a thousand nows 
32 lost midnights, they drive the indigo 33 in the 
city of palm 34 to the jazz of a lover's 
burn 35 seek that moody beauty quick & foot sure 
36 that wound who strolls the edge 37 her truth 
is oasis to all who've entered 38 touch it with 
your tongue
