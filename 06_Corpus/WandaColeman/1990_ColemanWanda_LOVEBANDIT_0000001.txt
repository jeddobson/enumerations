1 i'm in a place where there are no thieves 
2 i think 3 so i go out into the 
slaver's night 4 to join new friends and leave the 
door 5 to my cell unlocked 6 when i return 
i know instantly someone has entered 7 and gone. he's 
left behind evidence 8 an empty wine glass 9 it 
shimmers in the center 10 of a barren heart
