1 i have wed and bed your son 2 he 
has impregnated me 3 mother of the thin lie 4 
my nights grow heavy, anguished 5 seed of the dream 
of dread hours without 6 and its voice in me 
screams 7 mother of the thin lie 8 the filth 
of your tongue 9 fouls the beauty of your face 
10 and your eyes 11 sallow moons 12 seed of 
the jealous god Dambula 13 oh bitter mother of the 
thin lie 14 i have cut off his balls 15 
am drunk with and washed in his blood 16 return 
me to purity
