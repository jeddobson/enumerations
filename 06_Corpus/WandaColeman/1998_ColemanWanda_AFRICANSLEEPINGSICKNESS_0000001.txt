1 i sleep to wake and take my sleeping slow 
2 i feel my fate in what i fear 3 
i learn my feelings as i go 4 there's too 
much to learn and infinity to know 5 i dance 
my dance from tear to tear 6 i sleep to 
wake and take my snoring slow 7 of those so 
near outside me who are you? 8 Asmodeus blisters this 
ground! i shall stomp mightily 9 here and be lost 
by going where? nowhere to go 10 night take the 
sun! but who can tell me how? 11 o lowly 
servant scours crystal stair 12 dares dream to wake and 
takes that dreaming slow 13 great nation has nothing to 
do but dally with 14 my life/pollute the air and 
dastardly i'm spun 15 in circles round and round up 
and down i go 16 my shaking heart's unsteady i 
should know 17 what rises rises always, and is near 
18 i sleep to wake and take my rimming slow 
19 i learn by groping where i'm damned to go
