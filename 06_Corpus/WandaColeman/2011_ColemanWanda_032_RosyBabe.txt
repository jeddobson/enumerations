tripping out from behind the wheel

he grabbed the bag mid-stumble,

chug-a-lugging mint-green mouthwash

like boiler gin, salvation from last night's

blink and indiscretions at breakfast

his arrival on campus coincided with classes

letting out, and he found himself wading

thru harried students and introspective

instructors, his eyes burning, caught between

the fog and the sting of sweetness

at that moment she appeared,

the goddess of tanned skin and peekaboo

tattoos at the whiff of a crack.

as he swallowed, she glowered his way,

“Hey, ol' man, you left your lights on!”

in return for the favor, he caught

her lamps with his and held them long

enough, brightly enough to beam the

implication clear. he was gonna

have a hell of a Monday after all.
