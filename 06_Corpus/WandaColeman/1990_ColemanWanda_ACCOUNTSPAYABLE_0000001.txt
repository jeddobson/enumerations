1 i've been reduced to rubber-tipped fingers 2 shuffling tons 
of invoices 3 a debt that remains unpaid 4 the 
auditors have arrived 5 and the ledger of my sweat, 
closed 6 appeals to accounting 7 go unrecognized among the 
columns 8 and day after day the figure i seek 
to identify avoids tally 9 at the bank they whisper 
when they see me enter the line 10 another withdrawal 
11 my days here are numbered
