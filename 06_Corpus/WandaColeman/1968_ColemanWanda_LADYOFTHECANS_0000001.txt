1 the pungent putrid stink of america's bung hole 2 
goggs us as we pass her on our way 3 
she fishes for them with a long wooden stick 4 
puts them in drab olive trash bags 5 her naked 
yellow hands 6 seeking the soft the crushable the disposable 
7 sometimes i took the kids with me 8 most 
times i went alone, a box of plastic trash bags 
9 in the back seat of the car. i didn't 
use rubber gloves 10 till the beery stench sickened me 
and i thought 11 i might catch a germ 12 
hunting the soft round-bottomed aluminum cans 13 i was starving 
on pride and $45 a week in unemployment 14 so 
i started collecting them to make extra cash 15 not 
sure how many cans i'd need and 16 too embarrassed 
to ask 17 i concentrated on liquor stores, parks 18 
and along railroad tracks and freeway off ramps 19 when 
i thought i had enough to make it count 20 
i promised the kids meat for dinner 21 and drove 
twenty miles to the recycling plant 22 my weeks of 
scrounging barely brought in five bucks 23 my laughing lover 
later told me 24 that if i wanted to make 
any kind of money 25 in that profession 26 i 
needed a can crusher, a pick-up truck 27 and better 
sense
