At the end of existence

the porch light cracks

extinguished by rain. How complex,

how imperfect: the bleak light

from behind a window like

a beacon from a lighthouse off the

coast. Night after day after

the bulb remains broken, but

the beacon shines, so there is light,

of a sort, when dusk is reached.

The door ajar, bleak light

leaks its revelation: the shadows/

old and arthritic

slow dance to long ago
