1 as we exit the elevator we step into the 
2 Santa Cruz of 1981. the dark inebriated hallways of 
3 Hotel St. George call my name and ask who 
allowed 4 me in. we sense a sudden spasm in 
our direction. 5 it is he. he lurches outside our 
lovers' suite. 6 he stumbles besotted besnotted 7 in purples 
blues and browns---he of the deeply 8 cratered psyche toast-colored 
skin and lunar eclipses 9 half-Negro half-Jew all reeking devastation 
10 (having spent ten years in a notsolongago lifted 11 
self-proclaimed silence) having that afternoon been 12 booed off and 
having been carried from the stage 13 in the tender 
adoration of saxophone and 14 double bass. he spies us 
recognizes us and invites us 15 to the party in 
the court of the king of beatitude 16 (Harry Silver 
and the gang are there) 17 where coverts rasp eloquently 
on the exasperations 18 of those sobered by the enthused 
applause of failed 19 versifiers and a doggerel pursuit that 
nets only 20 the promise of a hamilton and a 
rubber check. 21 as we watch, the legend staggers wall-to-wall 
22 sloshings from his glass splash to the hungry floor 
23 and are quickly drunk. and while we know who 
he is 24 we are reintroduced as fellow spooks to 
this specter 25 dancing on marbles. and when he hears 
his name he 26 looks askance shudders hisses and asks 
27 "Bob Kaufman? Who is Bob Kaufman?"
