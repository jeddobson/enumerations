how fitting

that the moon-ridden bones of a poet

should prove illusive in the fall of day

avoiding discovery by nose or suspicion

evading the public relations celebrations

of notorious times

how fitting

that the savviest of archeologists

and historians could not disturb

decades of rest, the somnambulate remains

of a rebel wordsmith/a seeker of men, a seeker

of the ultimate freedom

how fitting

what did they expect to find?

the decayed hips of ironic roses?

the yawning intellect slipping into

sack-inspired siestas on humid Andalusian

afternoons? the somber remainders

of a New York skyline? the ice-cold eyes

of lovers frosted over with failed romance?

the sanguineous leaves of unread confessions?

the expelled cartridges of redolent betrayal?

what did they expect to find?

that moment when one particular world

concluded? or the final notes of a paean

to the unknown?

grave, grave, i want you grave â€¦ .
