1 plainclothed cops chase a half-naked 2 mulatto man across 
the palm-studded 3 beach his arms flail as he strokes 
the air 4 his chest bursts through his ribbed white 
5 undershirt his khakis wet with piss. several 6 yards 
behind, his wife runs after them. she 7 screams his 
name. snot and tears mix 8 with the sand blown 
against her cinnamon face 9 by the wind. a crust 
forms on her face, 10 a mask of fear. one 
cop holds his black 11 semi-auto stiffly in his left 
hand as he 12 zig-zags in front of his partner. 
the 13 runaway has been running since youth 14 authority 
since his mother's covert pinches 15 since truant officers since 
badder boys 16 with bigger fists. someone is shouting 17 
"stop police! stop police!" 18 and it sounds like a 
prayer 19 words fly up to the blue where 20 
they strike the gulls who drop dead 21 on the 
sand like sun-fried adobe bricks
