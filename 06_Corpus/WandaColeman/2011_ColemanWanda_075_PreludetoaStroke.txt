this is a warning

the moment appears as if a cramp

but i know it goes generations deep

(the cross of excessive sugar and salt) middle toes

frozen together, unmovable and strange

next time will be the clockstopper

Uncle Kenneth worms his way up from the crypt

and into memory, skin as crisp as cracklins

from the VA nursing staff's neglect. when

i saw him last, he lay crying out his story through

tears and gaggings in urine and feces unable

to use his hands to wash or write either away

ginger-colored fingers as passive as the

White Owl stogies Uncle Harry used to pass

among friends until the box was empty,

leaving it for me to fight over with cousin Billy

or pretty quiet Carolyn, transfixed with fright

the girl Uncle Harry savored coolly under his nose,

like a fine imported cigar, taking frequent sniffs, lids

half-closed, making the gentle rollings of the molester

fast as blue-jet lightning, i feel my form asserting

independence from my rule, the interruption brief

but declamatous, its echo twinging along sinew,

a vague discomfort footward fanning the rays,

tooâ€”an uncanny skullache like dull rumbling thunder

this is a warning

life's gathering of dramas suddenly

nullified and things collected rendered

junk. so much yet to be. and yet

my life once taken so boldly seems about

to take me before i've lived enuff of it

progression forward and deadly

this moment cramplike frozen and strange. this warning
