the end of sleep weaves its notice in a

shortness of breath. i will never wear a dress

spun from gold. i will never walk without

sensing the past in my underbelly. i will not outlive

my ambitions or the judgments of others. i will die

amid cobwebs and clusters of insect larvae

while deciphering the Aleph. i will

walk the streets exuding strange hungers

and happy teeth, my eyes going off like guns

on strangers. i will walk with hips that are

monuments

stones and boulders under which many lovers

are interred. i will fight off the night, an old

friend turned enemy. i will wind up my dukes

and dam back the days. struggling to squeeze

oxygen out of the clouds and into my brain

when it is over, i will have a new being, a

sleeker, savvier version, and will retire the

moldy model â€¦ to, of course, allow its

waking in that realm of light most seem to favor

and i will continue on, with my darknesses, my

long rests at twilight, my nursings of the shadow

clinging to the small things taking my breath

as i behold them: a poem, a tinted photograph,

his body when i leave him in a state of flame
