1 all our prophets---dead. all our gold proves lead . 
2 those hours of getting stupid 3 on pertussin thunderbird 
back alley shine 4 tongue lashing the white hand side 
5 how revolutionary were those dirty sheets 6 & snot-soaked 
pillowcases 7 now that we have overcome our collective pain 
in public 8 nostalgia is pandemic as 9 former boogie 
bandits & jitternigs gather 10 to resurrect those days of 
bravado & berets 11 a monday kind of love. the 
fuck 12 was prematurely ejaculatory requiring 13 the mere thought 
of wetness and not the actuality 14 all that progress 
missed. all the beautiful shit .
