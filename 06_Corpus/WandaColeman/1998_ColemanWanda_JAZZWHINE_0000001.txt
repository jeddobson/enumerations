1 i was reborn in a massive trunk cascading forward 
2 toward the falls 3 while the endless scrollings of 
octaves tranced 4 me into hummings 5 unheard before the 
roar. nevertheless, twice baptized in 6 the shine, i could 
7 survive anything in those days maybe even my own 
mouth, 8 a known dancer on 9 the blade. now, 
i have troubled sleeps, bad circulation 10 and feet bruised 
11 on the insteps. the last time i saw the 
only grandmother 12 i have ever known 13 she was 
crying away that 1952 Sooner summer afternoon 14 perhaps recalling 
her 15 mother taken decades before by Mississippi fever perhaps 
16 sensing the shade 17 under which she would one 
day recline. i imagine her hands, 18 now a kindness 
19 across my shoulders, slim long naked yellow fingers tease 
20 my sunbleached locks 21 "you've got your daddy's hair 
but my melancholy soul," 22 as though we weren't 23 
strangers as though the banjo player in bibbed coveralls 24 
still strummed 25 his bluesy walk and white lemonade sweetened 
the heat and 26 her six daughters in 27 their 
homemade dresses tittered as our men tested their 28 prowess 
barnside 29 with strong cords and a mighty axe while 
i forever stand 30 in that doorway gone 31 farm 
dust, "grandma, what's wrong?" sings off my lips 32 and 
into this 33 California dawn where coffee customarily calls down 
34 comfort. because 35 i once dared think i was 
immune to rhythms past and 36 had all damage 37 
under the mute, solo and jazzed for the new sounds 
the 38 new croons and in my 39 arrogance had 
no need for those old licks and tricks for 40 
hicks in the sticks 41 till my eyes began to 
bleed and i could no longer find my ears
