heart out of ripe california melons and giggles 8 like

i 9 pick it for the first time 10 and 
Chuck's eyes pleasure up and down my paper-thin black 11

wait to 12 get me off into the first juke

you ever go to a strange place, sugar, all you 
have to do 14 is find and follow one of

the mighty white do-right cracker eatery on 16 sunday morning 
for slow service funking up the gray boy 17 interior 
with our motel monkey fuck musk and it's all 18 
outrageous fun as Chuck goes into his geechie act 19

earthquake if you know how
