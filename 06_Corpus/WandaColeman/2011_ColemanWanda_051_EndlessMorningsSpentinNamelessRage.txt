another morning finds me numbed among the legions

whose protests are cruelly nullified by the daily struggle/

rituals of fear (where is the next crumb coming from?)

all joys spoiled, dance rhythms gone war throes

ever-poor me, my back sclerotic, the afternoons adrift in spells

of dysfunction, staring at news broadcasts/the usual escape

worthless. should i kill off a novel written to free the author from

cancer of the soul or humanities department hell? soon to be major

box office? or follow my God-given moroseness into an eternal sulk?

once i was in touch with life beyond clich√©s

dared think myself mythic in this wilderness

now reduced to scarfing doobies

like an angel banished earthward

in alleyways and closets

the weight of the sun nails my black eyelids shut

the mattress as seductive as the roiling sky.

home is a stucco prison and i'm stir-crazed

for the route the path the exit the catapult up away

through time

o wings git me dere

i have erased all the names of all the betrayers, all the cowards

who have doomed me. they shall never find life in my words

and i will only speak their infamies, naming the victims,

proudly penning anthems to the innocent and the damned

(each waking finds me granite-eyed with my gone son's singings)

the brave must rise the brave must rise. needed:

an immediate infusion of national respect for the living

i can't wait another Christian moment for it

my hate is too precious to waste. i choose my victories as

i choose my battles/a blood diplomacy

convinced the world will be the world

challenging every supposition

subjugating the weak of heart

ultimately our history written by the mighty

and by those unbroken by might

thus, this morning finds me numbed yet belligerent as i rise to join

the legions

my every remaining hypertensive breath a protest
