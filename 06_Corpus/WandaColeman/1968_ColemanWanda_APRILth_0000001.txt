It's been a wonderful trip and I'm feeling great! But 
fun costs and I've overspent on my trip to San 
Francisco and go to the bank to cash a check. 
There's an old white woman damn near eighty in front 
of me. She needs a deposit/withdrawal slip from the counter 
across the room, but hesitates to leave the long Monday 
A.M. line because she might lose her place. Rather than 
ask me to hold it for her, which I don't 
mind doing, she talks around me, as if I'm not 
standing there, to a white woman in her sixties directly 
behind me. (I'm 6'2" in my brown leather boots and 
have the darkest skin in the place.) When the woman 
in her sixties reassures her, she leaves the line. When 
the line moves up I move up a step, leaving 
enough room for the eighty-year-old's return. Suddenly, the sixty- year-old 
addresses me boldly: "She wants her place back when she 
returns!" "I heard. I got ears," I say extremely rude 
and loud. "You don't have to talk to me like 
that!" she says---half whine and half revulsion. "Fuck off lady!" 
I say loud enough to silence her and the en- 
tire bank. Then I allow the eighty-year-old to re-enter the 
line ahead of me. I'm satisfied my behavior will puzzle 
the sixty-year-old for time to come; wondering what she did 
to evoke such nastiness. Or perhaps shell dismiss me as 
just another hostile young nigger wench. I'm not feeling so 
great any more. Save me from bigoted old white bitches.
