1 in the business i can't get the business 2 
even if marvelously stupendously qualified 3 qualifications aren't at issue 
4 question is can i walk-the-walk talk-the-talk 5 give good 
meeting? the fact that i can turn 6 emotional lead 
into literary gold (if allowed into 7 the lab) merely 
inspires lunch-interview at a tony 8 bistro or the mere 
whiff of boardroom neon. close 9 but no cashier's check. 
it's not anywhere near 10 the blatant bigotry previously practiced 
by 11 their parents. they like black music and 12 
the moves blacks make. they can even do 13 the 
chu berry and the james brown 14 of course i 
understand. it's never personal 15 i'm just not quite what 
makes the old 16 socks go up and down
