1 they came down to see my tragedy 2 one 
of those bloody nights 3 the streets were hot gray 
4 i summoned familiar faces from all over L.A. and 
5 vomited all over myself right before their eyes 6 
(it may not make for good living, she said 7 
but it sure makes wonderful poetry) 8 he was there, 
had a front seat in my heat 9 i foresaw 
our night together knew it would be good 10 it 
was. we fucked like no tomorrow 11 at 2 AM 
he sneaked out and didn't bother to lock the door 
12 i could've been murdered in bed 13 (yeah, she 
said, i wouldn't do that for the world 14 you're 
stronger than i am. you can take it) 15 summer 
into his eyes 16 his tongue i missed yous in 
my ear, along my neck 17 it wasn't love but 
damn i was content to make do 18 should've known 
better should've smelled a rat 19 been deserted by so 
many 20 times i couldn't even get a decent put 
down 21 (what'd it feel like? i'm a mindfuckin' yoyo 
22 of a voyeur. feed my pain long distance) 23 
i lay there blood on her rug 24 memories spilled 
out of me a funky torrent of blues 25 i'd 
be lucky to be strung out on something tangible 26 
like heroin or speed 27 there must be something illegal 
i can do 28 (give me all the details. i 
don't want to miss 29 a thing, she squeezed the 
siphon) 30 when he ignored me at the party 31 
i decided it takes a niggah to forget a niggah 
32 even that one's in texas now. brother love near 
sends 33 me to the hospital when we get down 
34 do people die of over copulation? 35 (give me 
a rag girl. give me a rag. let me plug 
36 up that hole fo' you drown me, sugar)
