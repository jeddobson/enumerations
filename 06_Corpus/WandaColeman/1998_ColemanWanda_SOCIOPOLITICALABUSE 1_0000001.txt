the doctor 4 in case somethin' else is wrong 5 
but it's blood fresh and red 6 this morning he 
made me promise to seriously 7 consider having the child 
if (he gets that job 8 paying lots of ducats. 
enuff for me to stay home) 9 i was cold 
last night and cold this morning. it's late 10 spring, 
almost summer. something else could be wrong 11 i cancel 
one appointment to make another. i 12 haven't told him 
yet. we're going to go there 13 together. something else 
is wrong. i told him. i don't 14 want to 
raise another child in poverty. the money is 15 forever 
not enough. i promised i'd think it over but 16 
something has happened beyond all controls and 17 in the 
bathroom i discover bright red blood and 18 thick burgundy-colored 
clots. we had so much time 19 to plan. to
