1 backgammon afternoons 2 coffee stronger than Samson and sweeter 
than Delilah 3 sullen mediterranean and oblique, the neighbormen stare 
4 at my comings and goings, measure my mettle 5 
my night-colored skin, its spark & flame 6 with steady 
kingly eyes, watch my children and 7 observe my men. 
8 displaced potentates, they occupy the stoops for hours 9 
as if thrones, accepting the ministrations of 10 potato-fleshed, wheat-eyed 
wives smelling of saffron, 11 nutmeg and paprika/women with veiled 
minds and veiled 12 tongues 13 bejeweled daughters & arrogant 
half-American sons 14 i feel their wonderings at the veranda 
window 15 they watch me work, piqued by the constant 
clicking 16 of that typewriter to that music played too 
loud 17 what kind of democracy creates whoever you are? 
18 they never speak except to offer something for sale 
19 or "please Miss can you move your car?"
