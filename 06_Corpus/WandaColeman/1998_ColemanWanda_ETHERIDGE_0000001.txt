1 he slept thru his ascension of the northern latitudes 
2 to be rudely awakened by the stink of burning 
cash 3 heat. stinging July heat and firecrackers went off 
4 in his mouth 5 in the elevator up his 
brain swelled, 6 threatened to explode---as did his lungs 7 
spiraling upwards, 8 he came alone but knew they could 
hear him too well through 9 those sheet-rock tar-paper chicken 
wire walls 10 like speedballs moving upstream, stray thoughts howled 
and 11 screeched with feline lust under moonlight 12 the 
unfettered snores of dreamers tore at his ears 13 seducers 
in ancient postures and blood-red getups hugged the 14 curbs 
15 and toyed with stop signs and the hunger pangs 
of children 16 what lover of melodrama had condemned him 
to 17 this month of Saturday nights? 18 whizzing bullets 
pierced naked calm leaving cracks & 19 expelled casings 20 
best leave now best leave now 21 a jagged shuffling 
of feet housed in synthetic leather came from 22 behind 
him to suggest he travel faster 23 he kissed the 
reefer burning his thief's fingers 24 leaned against that bitchin' 
hood and blimped the itch 25 his blaze interrupted the 
sermon and singed the robes
