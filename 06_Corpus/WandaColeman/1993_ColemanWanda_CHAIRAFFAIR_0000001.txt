into an awkward angle every 7 time i get up 
so i am forced to look at it 8 before 
i sit down again 9 hard little round metallic doo-doos 
10 keep coming out of the chair 11 causing me 
to watch my step 12 i have offered a truce. 
the loss of 25 13 pounds. the chair scoffs 14 
the chair doctor states it will take 15 months and 
over four thousand dollars to 16 cure the chair 17 
today my horoscope said avoid 18 recalcitrant chairs 19 when 
i came in from lunch 20 i found another butt 
in my chair 21 "chairs are the true plague of
