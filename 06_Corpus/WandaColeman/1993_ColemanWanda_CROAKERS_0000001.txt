1 on harlem avenue on gladys they're drunk off 2 
derision and the aroma of unwashed bodies 3 unkempt clothes 
and uncollected garbage 4 by midnight hundreds of stumblers are 
blindly 5 eclipsed by something tantamount to death as 6 
they crouch by fires of blazing waste 7 tonight a 
thin blue hope's about to snap/life's 8 pull this gloom 
of heading nowhere lucky to 9 be unmolested by the 
cops or tougher scavengers 10 clawing crawling these gilt gutters 
a gang of 11 analyses doomed to statistical disappearances 12 
skidding into the crack of no return
