1 she died before christening and, therefore 2 had no 
name, but i will gladly lend her one of mine 
3 dear Georgiana, 4 Mama followed the stars in those 
days. do you 5 suppose she blames me for your 
death? and, too, 6 Papa's mother died on my horizon. 
have your lives 7 been absorbed into mine and have 
i lived you well? 8 is that what she holds 
against me---your eternal 9 breathlessness? would she have loved me 
more 10 if you had lived? and if not more, 
then at 11 least without fear? Papa accepted me as 
his 12 altho too much his in my stubbornness. if 
your 13 death hurt him it must've been the lesser 
hurt. 14 as i've observed of men, the adage seems 
true. 15 had you lived, perhaps you would have done 
16 better in fulfilling your duties to mother. 17 you 
would have taken care of her affairs better. 18 you 
would have married within the race. you 19 would've made 
her proud without reservations. 20 you would've had her breasts 
and good hair. 21 forgive the brevity of this letter, 
but i am 22 demanded elsewhere. i'll write again later, 
23 hoping we'll have more to share. please think 24 
my questions over carefully before you answer. 25 and if 
you can't be kind, please, be fair. 26 yours,
