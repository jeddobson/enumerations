i am writing this note with sincere wishithadn'ts.

i will not be coming to visit. the story goes like so—i regret

to report that i've desisted. not my feet, altho

they are certainly well on their way to toes-up status. not

my eyes, altho the peering is weakened. not my brain—altho it

writhes in a stew of disappointments. not yet,

my heart, altho it bulges under the weight of familial woes

and in that deep makes strange valvular clicks.

take a guess. yes, that's it! my enthusiasm is a departed thing

of the immediate past. putting one foot before the other

has become a Herculean task. the hard work that sustained me

with its challenges has become an ungodly chore.

the dream delight winged into my mind has morphed into

a turgid lump that anchors my spirit in fire. no, friend, i will not

be coming to see you. i want you blind to my diminishment.

unable to see this dread, unable to wince at this shrillness

clearing my life of worthwhile companions. remember

me as i was—with huge appetites and ideas, my womanly

lust for the flesh of men, how adventure thrilled

me, how i was so unshakably unshakable. keep that me. find

comfort in memories of her. believe it when i say the upstart

vixen you once knew still rages, somewhere. know she's fighting,

always fighting—blood in her teeth, bang in her eyes
