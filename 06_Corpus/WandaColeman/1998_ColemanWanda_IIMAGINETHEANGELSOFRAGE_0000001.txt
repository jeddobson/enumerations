1 This is the year of The Thirty-Nine 2 those 
jettisoned bodies 3 gazing comet-struck into 4 the god void 
5 aboard the Momship 6 levitating impotent souls to escape 
the 7 black doom of plimsole consumerism; 8 this is 
the purple dawn 9 that enshrouds hope's refugees and 10 
honors the renegade judges 11 who sanction bigotry as 12 
constitutional law---whose 13 files whose lips whose genitals 14 are 
smeared with the sap 15 of voiceless sages; 16 this 
is the year of the petty piety 17 police who 
reverse all 18 fair acts, blister airwaves with false 19 
Word in the name of religion, 20 apply Colombian neckties 
21 to innocent throats; 22 this is the year the 
greedskinned men 23 pervert The Splendor 24 reclaim their right 
to hate 25 to profit from pain, to lynch 26 
without apology for the 27 children they plunder. 28 This 
is the year my brain 29 detached itself from my 
heart 30 to wade the forsaken waters of time 31 
to shiver at gravesites 32 naked before the thunder and 
the drums 33 and the endless rain of crosses
