there was no name for it—that moment in which the lone smoker

dropped ash in the shadows of an empty bar, the piano blanketed over,

at the only available booth, back to maroon leather, mulling around

the notion of a new lover, toying with the cold thought of a hot affair

what could i name it—the pull of heavily lensed eyes, the assuredness

of your shoulders as you leaned over the pool table, confident in

your manhood, reading my attraction as if it were a headline,

the notion of privacy, darkness, the shedding of false skins

summoned up by my lonely soul

passion driving flesh like the El through designated vistas, twisting

on relentlessly day or night, carrying a mixed baggage of castabouts,

castoffs and castaways, daring the tunnels and damning the skies, those

piercing shudders of wheels on rails, those piercing cries of tensions recycled

this is the hotel Bismarck, where limousines once coughed up gold

slippers and magnums of dry Italian brut, where emperors dined and

high-class thugs ruled the smarmy depths, where divas flaunted ice

tiaras, furs, and floor-length hearts, ascending to descend plush red-

velvet stairways like legends

let's call it Chicago

this, a palatial ruin at the end of the atomic age, the patina ever

grand, the mahogany polished yet, crystal chandeliers sunshowers of

glitz, jacketed doormen in brass and epaulets catering of late to a

polyester-and-Spam clientele, and i, Child of West, hawking pain for

glory and a spot on the pantheon

would dare call this heaven, my pose as a later stage black beauty in the

throes of her woes, keeping not only the faith, but the promise to be

faithful—yet longing to yield and give way to the mundane breakage of a

vow, covets now this empty room, these empty chairs, the bandstand

absent musicians, singer, song
