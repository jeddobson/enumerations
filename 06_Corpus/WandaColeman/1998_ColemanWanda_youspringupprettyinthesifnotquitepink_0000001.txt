1 you spring up pretty in the 50s if not 
quite pink 2 in a gold-ribboned box filled with candy-kiss 
hearts 3 and yellow marshmallow baby chicks and chewy milk 
4 chocolate bunny rabbits. Johnny Appleseed is Lord 5 and 
Savior. periods come quietly undercover at night and 6 do 
not soil green flannel blankets or rose-colored jammies. 7 promises 
are strike-me-dead sacred and vows, treasures. 8 babies, like angels, 
belong in a cool distant cloud-lined 9 heaven populated by 
storks and flamingos. at school, nobody 10 wants you on 
their team. you tell yourself you're 11 superior to the 
naughty sprites who poke fun at you. you 12 know 
that God aka Johnny will punish them when they grow 
up
