1 bury me in soft paper 2 with my name 
neatly typed in the 3 upper left hand corner 4 
covered in cockled surfaces 5 a watermark of aborted attempts 
6 an empty ream box for my bed 7 among 
the petals/words fallen softly 8 place onyx paperweights on my 
eyelids 9 and let them hum---hum steadily 10 gentle chorus 
11 of lone stubborn typewriters 12 heard in early morning 
13 double space twice, and there inscribe 14 an epitaph 
of written bys 15 by the word i live by 
the word i die 16 bury me in soft paper
