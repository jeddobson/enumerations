1 the horn the horn blows 2 green moving thru 
undertow this sea these eyes promise soft 3 lights and 
lips pursed in sweet-hot tomorrows. his heart wavers 4 for 
a bit, shivers. "suppose she says no." a whine, a 
5 flicker. something is wrong, but he doesn't know what. 
a 6 certain odor. a certain note off key 7 
the horn the horn toots 8 upstairs thighs drop in 
misconception. but this isn't the 9 right number. she's black 
like cobalt and her eyes rise over 10 him 11 
a serpent; teeth sharp as needles, a tongue thick with 
smoke 12 winds 13 its way throatward. and the venom 
numbs his dick. death at 14 $3.33 per minute 15 
the horn the horn soars 16 leaving a sour aftertaste. 
a skullcap of roses. stale doobies 17 clutter the table 
top. nose full of coke boogers 18 needed, a hot 
shower across town. sunday morning his soul is 19 ripped 
open. bleeds love. and she was never even there
