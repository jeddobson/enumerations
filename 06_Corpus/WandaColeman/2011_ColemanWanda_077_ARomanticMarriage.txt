the bat in the skull. soul & sweet amber wine

ball-and-chain diary

every nook contains formulae for lust prolonged

step by step. vacant examinations

down to the nakedness, beneath the skin

like his cock, his hard rhymes have found me

and work through me to the p-bone

he exits the premises, the door open

leaves blown in off the walk

shadows thrown in the dim light of overcast suns

these bewildered agates locked on the past

the heart interred

discover this body is haunted
