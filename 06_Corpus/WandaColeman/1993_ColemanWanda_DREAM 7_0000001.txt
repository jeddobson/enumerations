1 manchild and lover in tow, i 2 revisit a 
mindscape/lead our run down 3 corridor after corridor. my son 
keeps up 4 but my lover complains, "you're moving too 
fast" 5 then he 6 stumbles and drops to one 
knee 7 "i've caught two bullets in my head," he 
sobs 8 "it's all your fault for being in such 
a hurry." 9 i wonder. was it the man with 
the beretta? 10 as my guy collapses, i rush to 
his side, hug 11 his head to my heart. an 
official doctor's voice 12 announces he has two hours to 
live if 13 we don't get him to the hospital 
quick 14 my son and i 15 lift him to 
his feet. like zip my lover 16 is in swaddling 
clothes, arms bared, dark chest 17 hair exposed against red-white 
skin, eyes closed 18 in a faint. like zap the 
hospital bed swerves into 19 focus. he's in it, eyes 
staring upward and away 20 mouth slack, face expressionless. the 
ash-blonde 21 nurse fluffs his pillow, gives me a hostile 
stare 22 and tells me to shove it 23 "he 
doesn't want you," she says. "he's angry" 24 i bogart 
my way to his side only to discover 25 the 
sickbed has become a giant bassinet. he's 26 changed into 
a cuddly little brown monkey stuffy 27 with glazed button 
peepers, a tiny red-and-white 28 beach ball sewn into his 
mitt. he can't move 29 but his toy-eyes clitter with 
fury 30 no time to examine my horror 31 like 
zooey 32 i'm in the casino, wading thru the fleshy 
bodies 33 of elderly white women and their disgruntled 34 
cow-fed spouses. i'm looking for my beloved 35 when up 
ahead 36 i spy Pop shuffling in, out 37 and 
around, arms at his waist, steady swinging 38 forward and 
back the way we used to do when we 39 
played choo-choo train 40 i break the applause meter. he's 
the way he was 41 a couple of years after 
surgery, clad in his 42 ragged white polyester pj top 
over baggy old navy 43 blue slacks barely held up 
off his behind by 44 those tired old brown suspenders, 
the elastic 45 top of his white undershorts doing a 
peek-a-boo 46 he turns and beckons. i remember. 47 he's 
dead 48 rudely, the alarm does its buzz 49 my 
sweetheart rises beside me 50 and hits the disrupt 51 
"time to get up," he yawns, falls 52 back into 
the sheets and buries his head 53 under the pillows
