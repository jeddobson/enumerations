1 i am afraid of telephones 2 one of my 
greatest highs is city driving 3 before sunrise after rain, 
listening 4 frequently the likeness of my first husband 5 
masks the faces of our children calling to mind 6 
an inscription i made on a photo---some hogshit 7 about 
his being my first my last 8 i hate dresses 
9 i have no fear of needles 10 only users 
of needles 11 the only thang i'm hooked on these 
days 12 is money. withdrawal pangs are constant 13 i'm 
not the type, said i 14 all women are the 
type said he 15 and if you're not it's going 
to be quite a 16 pleasure finding out what type 
you are 17 my worst nightmares are about telephones 18 
once i pulled off a robbery 19 got away with 
the goods, then, like a fool 20 gave them to 
my lover-of-the-moment 21 to impress him 22 Ann Petry wrote 
my life's story published the year 23 i was born 
24 i prefer commercials over programming 25 black and white 
over color 26 informed silence over ignorant applause 27 i 
pray only on airplanes 28 occasionally one of my dreams 
29 comes true 30 once in a while i pass 
myself going 31 in the other direction 32 i am 
afraid of the light 33 at the end of a 
poem
