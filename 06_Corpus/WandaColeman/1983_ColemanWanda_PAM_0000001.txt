1 called me long distance at midnight 2 woke me 
and told me 3 her father died in the hospital 
that evening 4 died while talking with her stepmom 5 
in mid-laugh 6 she cried a bit 7 on her 
way to being bombed/a little booze 8 to lose the 
blues and memory, shares 9 that birthday party 10 the 
time i read the poems with the 4 letter words 
11 and how her blind raven haired diabetic 12 dad 
of french and latin descent 13 liked me a lot 
less 14 tonight it is this recollection 15 transmitting warmth 
north 16 along the hot thin wires of hurt 17 
i hear her smile and the slight slur says 18 
she'll be okay in the good morning
