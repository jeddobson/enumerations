1 the child screams. screams for mother. screams 2 for 
God. screams "don't." screams "it 3 hurts." screams and screams 
for daddy 4 a break. a silence 5 then it 
comes again. the screaming 6 getting off the elevator i 
see them. everyone who 7 works here has to see 
them, there's no evasion 8 no place to hide from 
it. no employees' 9 hang. this charity facility was established 
10 around the start of the century. i hear some 
old rich 11 white dowager keeps it in blood money. 
the building 12 i work in is named for her. 
recently, a popular 13 fast food chain has become a 
major contributor 14 there's an institutional motto: "we care." and 
we do 15 the turnover is a bitch. by the 
time you've learned 16 a new employee's name, they're gone. 
the hardnosed 17 the hard-up and the dedicated stay, faces 
of 18 smiling stone---black white hispanic, a few asians--- 19 
we blacks hang in longest. that thang in our history 
20 prepares us for on-going pain and suffering. those 21 
with good pension plans die in the saddle. i rank 
22 among the hard-up 23 this is a cold-blooded place, 
caring limited to 24 the children for whom we care. 
no one has time or budget 25 to sympathize with 
adults. we know 26 how absolutely lucky adults are to 
be adult 27 many of these kids will never make 
it 28 you see them yet you don't see them. 
it's understood 29 you don't register shock. the shocked go 
into a 30 restroom lock the door and cry. the 
shocked 31 may be fired within a relatively short time 
for showing 32 shock. the shocked are hasty to seek 
work elsewhere. the 33 shocked get the hell out one 
way or another 34 my face that smiles that's also 
stone 35 holding elevator doors open for women wrestling 36 
with strollers wheelchairs gurneys is utmost courtesy 37 the men 
have left them eighty-five percent of fathers 38 of disabled 
children leave mom to tough it out 39 alone. (it 
ain't his fault the baby was imperfect. who 40 did 
the drug. who had the bad gene pool. who fucked 
41 around. who God cursed. who who who. i, said 
the 42 sparrow with my little bow and arrow) 43 
mom may be no saint. there are foster homes and 
44 institutes. bureaucratic warehousing 45 the kids hurt. seeing kids 
hurt i hurt. i learn 46 to turn it off 
47 there was the darlin' five-year-old son of 48 the 
rock stars. they came in dressed for fame, tall 49 
thin in fashion in jewelry in attitude---baaad 50 beautiful young 
black dutiful---and stood in the hallways 51 for hours, too 
old a story: the kid with natural charm 52 the 
kid who seduces everyone with his preciousness 53 innocence freshness. 
name it 54 when his hair began to thin i 
realized 55 it was falling out. some days 56 he 
was listless and milky about his skin 57 and some 
days gloom displaced fame 58 on those sweet glamorous faces 
(war. what 59 true war is about) 60 i stop 
myself and turn it off. i can't let myself 61 
feel for their child 62 "this is a job," my 
maxim 63 i ride the elevator my smile of stone 
intact 64 eyes sensitized to the smallness, ready for the 
65 too real bugged eyes of down's syndrome the cranial 
66 distortions of hydrocephaly the twisted limbs of 67 accidents 
the visual evidence of the chromosomal 68 damages of one 
drug or another---the "premees" the 69 spinal deformities---the monsters 70 
businesses and a few music tv stars donate 71 time 
toys money. there's a biannual telethon. a resident 72 artist 
practices healing thru self expression 73 the first artist i 
met was a black man, quite 74 excellent himself. it 
was interesting to see what 75 he extracted from the 
children. bright vivid stark 76 masterpieces hung outside the cafeteria. 
i'd stop and 77 admire images of death frustration the 
Devil hope--- 78 even exciting bold abstracts---work good enough for 
the 79 galleries. he left. a younger white woman took 
over 80 suddenly butterflies buttercups dolls and birdies--- 81 pastels 
appeared 82 it's true what they say, i thought, children 
are a canvas 83 i avoided artists after that 84 
yes. the sights disturb me. disrupt my sleep 85 a 
nightmare my daughter's hair thinned to her scalp 86 symptomatic 
of a brain tumor/chemotherapy 87 what can i do? i 
can't let my child die without 88 a fight. i 
sit straight up in bed 89 shocked into jittering clarity 
90 i handle the screams with my walkman kept in 
91 the upper right-hand drawer of my desk which 92 
effectively mutes the cries for God for father for 93 
mother for the doctor to stop hurting 94 for the 
hurting to stop 95 they're to be seen everywhere, the 
child population 96 mixed in with professional and ancillary adults 
97 it is stunningly profound 98 how important 99 a 
piece of paper 100 may be to little sick and 
dying 101 bits of humanity 102 all colors shames and 
sizes 103 some of these kids won't make it, i 
think as i 104 watch them exit elevators on crutches 
struggling to 105 walk. mobility is life. the limbs grow 
frail. sores 106 appear at the neck. limbs are lost. 
something fungal--- 107 a rash related to immuno-deficiency. a malformation 
108 of head face palate 109 i watch them my 
eyes bleed 110 as i pass on the way to 
photocopy on my way to 111 lunch on my way 
home to my hard life waiting 112 to my children. 
and if one chances to look my way 113 i've 
got my stone smile ready 114 they're precious, all of 
them, is how i look at it--- 115 service
