it is the year of love-eyed vixens with paper cheechees

plaids, pleats, and Hawaiian-print polished cotton

bus rides on the red line, south to Gompers Junior High

oxfords are good for hopscotch, or scuffles at

recess, or long walks home made longer by gossiping

with girls named Dee, Jill, or Nancy, or twisting

fingers with boys named Oscar, Wayland, or Red

(white or black patent leather is reserved for church service and concerts)

i engage in scopings for mange-free strays to adopt,

or the scooping up of broke-winged birds for burial,

stopping for a soda a burger a comic book, wasting

a week's allowance in stingy quarters and dimes

“cooling it” on the porch when summer scorches the sidewalks,

admiring the whoosh of big-finned convertibles & coupes

on dinner duty for Moms, as she does a last-minute shop

(morning screams from the hallway still in my ears,

awakened to kill the earthworm trapped in newswrap. bruises

from spankings like blueberries under my skin. the marks

white teachers never notice. how can such an angel-faced creature

be such a violent bitch? and here i am her bittersweet spit)

on phone duty for Pops (ever absent without leave), collecting maydays

from the ships that never sail

living on books, in this revisiting, sometimes leaving loneliness

for skate blisters and the laughter and shouts of neighbor kids

between ooobopshebop sways and swings between bike rides,

foul shots and hikes to the corner store for milk, bread, and syrup

a cooking ironing mopping scrubbing sewing washing fool

the fragrance of wet grass ever rises on breezes, sates my nose

as i hose our lawn every evening at sundown. it will permeate

those dreams ahead. for now, i am content to watch the western

sky go rose go violet blue as all rainbows vanish in the spray
