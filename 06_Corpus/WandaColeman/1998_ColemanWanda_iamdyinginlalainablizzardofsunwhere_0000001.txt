1 i am dying in lala in a blizzard of 
sun where 2 my killers always profit from my death. 
3 look here at the flat little rectangle of embossed 
4 gray stone/the evidence of days. and there, the ants 
have 5 taken over speeding busily to and from the 
oblivious 6 hill. something tiny yet beautiful has declared 7 
root, an absurd pinkness. and over there, its white 8 
sister. and listen. the precious costly silence broken 9 only 
by the distant sigh of an airship's landing and the 
10 aria of a sad bird on its sagging wire 
above the unkempt 11 yard. so many's the years one 
must pay till paying is 12 up. and only the 
lucky find their ways underground 13 oh. thirst. oh. pride. 
14 i am dying in lala in a sunblaze in 
15 a dream dreamt then forsaken
