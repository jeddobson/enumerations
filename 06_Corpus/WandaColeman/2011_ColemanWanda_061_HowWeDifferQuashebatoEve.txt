your hands, they say, are perfect in tone and touch

it is rumored i have no hands. oh, but mine

are gifted yet denied, express the hours at common

labor as well as a minute's comfort, nails broken

to the quick spring back as talons for the rend,

tear through falsities, leave ash & lava

your breasts, they say, so perfect in shape and heft

boy-chested when the wind and the law demands speed,

my breasts sport armor for battling the flash of blades

or rise maiden-high to tempt the lips of legions,

heavy with nursing the years and yards,

shifting in texture and size over being over space

your feet, they say, step deftly after his

i step wise, abreast and by night and so swift

my feet, like owls themselves, entangle his

or make quick my escape when twinight is nigh,

and winged take me flying among men head-to-head

shoulder-to-shoulder, i stand so black so equal

your eyes, they say, are innocent yet coy

my eyes are harbor for the world. travel them

to enter an infinity of darknesses, the tests

and tensions of weakened spirits, the travails

and hungers harp, where satiation brings

dissatisfaction, unblinking, brazen, beguiling

he takes you, they say, for children in his image

here in my forbidden grasp/the gates

all is pleasure as we twist against conventions

and race bias, release inner pumas, prowling

the night/beast seeking beastâ€”then his seed

brings forth a generation wearing my stain
