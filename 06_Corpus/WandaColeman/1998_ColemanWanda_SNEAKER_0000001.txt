1 he comes home in his black leather biker jacket, 
the 2 one Joe Jr. left behind before death 3 
by stabbing just shy of high school graduation, eleven 4 
years ago. the leather is worn at the 5 neck 
where fabric meets flesh. he sits down at the kitchen 
6 table and stares at the floor. there's 7 a 
giant black Japanese beetle scuttling from the refrigerator 8 to 
the stove. he gets up to go but 9 something 
holds him to the chair. it's her voice singing his 
10 name which moves ear to ear, 11 penetrates his 
head, reverberates. a plaintive call, almost 12 a whine. he 
takes off the jacket 13 and looks at his arms. 
he sees the holes there, puckered 14 like volcanoes the 
size of pinheads. 15 he wonders how long it'll take 
before she notices. it'll be 16 summer soon and she'll 
have to start 17 wondering why he's wearing long sleeves 
all the time and 18 why he jumps when she 
comes into the 19 bathroom without knocking. and he knows 
she misses sex and 20 he tries not to stare 
when she 21 stuffs her face with food to fill 
the void of him/her 22 need. he is disgusted. she 
23 rates better. he knows everything about the world. he 
knows 24 it will not let him off. he 25 
knows that there is a small and significant crypt reserved 
26 following sentence, yet mouth 27 enough to swallow them 
all, including the new baby. he puts 28 the jacket 
back on and zips it up 29 so hard it 
pinches his adam's apple. this stinks. he puts 30 his 
hands on the table. mulatto 31 hands. a thief's hands. 
he's stolen so many valuables. his 32 fingers itch. he 
remembers the date. 33 the old woman next door, she's 
gotten her social security 34 check today. it's noon. she 
goes to 35 the check cashing place early, to avoid 
waiting in line. 36 she's half deaf and fully 37 
defenseless. there's a singing now in his blood. he stands 
up 38 to go. he sits down again. he 39 
looks at his hands. he hears the music under the 
leather 40 the pulse that flares and shatters 41 his 
resolve like cheap glass. he stands. goes to the back 
door. 42 is careful not to be seen.
