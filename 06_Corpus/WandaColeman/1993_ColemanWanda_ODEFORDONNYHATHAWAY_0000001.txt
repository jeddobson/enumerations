1 and then there are the one-hit zombies 2 cursed 
to an eternity of Monday nights 3 who runs our 
music does not make it 4 controls manufacture and marketing 
of rhythm 5 schemes on and fixes the charts. it's 
polyphonic greed 6 from the dark of the chitlin to 
solid gold dawn 7 doublecrossed over 8 a love come 
down 9 after the plunge 10 sloshing around in limbo 
11 that too sweet gospel splash
