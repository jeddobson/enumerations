1 i get scared sometimes 2 and have to go 
look in to the closet to see if his clothes 
3 are still there 4 i have been known to 
imagine a situation 5 and then get involved in it, 
upset, angry and 6 cry hot tears 7 i have 
gone after people 8 with guns 9 once i tried 
to hang myself and got terribly ashamed 10 afterwards because 
1 was really faking it 11 i have gone after 
people 12 with rocks 13 i have cursed out old 
white lady cart pushers in 14 supermarkets who block the 
aisles in slow motion 15 i have gone after people 
16 with my fists 17 i have walked out on 
pavlovian trainers who mistook me 18 for a dog 19 
i go to sleep and have dreams about falling 20 
and can't stand the suspense so i sweat it out 
21 and land on my feet 22 i have gone 
after people 23 with poems 24 i get scared sometimes 
25 and have to go look into the mirror to 
see if i'm 26 still here
