1 when did we become friends? 2 it happened so 
gradual i didn't notice 3 maybe i had to get 
my run out first 4 take a big bite of 
the honky world and choke on it 5 maybe that's 
what has to happen with some uppity youngsters 6 if 
it happens at all 7 and now 8 the thought 
stark and irrevocable 9 of being here without you 10 
shakes me 11 beyond love, fear, regret or anger 12 
into that realm children go 13 who want to care 
for/protect their parents 14 as if they could 15 and 
sometimes the lucky ones do 16 into the realm of 
making every moment 17 important 18 laughing as though laughter 
wards off death 19 each word given 20 received like 
spanish eight 21 treasure to bury within 22 against that 
shadow day 23 when it will be the only coin 
i possess 24 with which to buy peace of mind
