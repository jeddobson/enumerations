1 doctor asked me if i had any sexual fantasies. 
i told him i 2 had none 3 my fantasies 
could not be spoken. they would not be well 4 
received 5 and he might try to kill me 6 
reality : him cruising by in his cadillac 7 me 
at the bus stop on my way home to hubby 
8 and the kid 9 he smiles and doubles back, 
ready as spring 10 i slide in next to the 
singer. at the motel 11 he plays hollywood to my 
watts 12 the doctor asked me who i loved most, 
my father or my 13 mother. and i 14 said 
i loved them both the same, but differently. father 15 
understood 16 one side of my personality and mother, the 
other 17 reality : him slipping the ring off my 
pinky 18 unnoticed, then pretending to help me look for 
it 19 he smiles and tells me he's ready 20 
i slide in under him, unaware that this is 21 
just another movie scene 22 doctor asked me what i 
thought about the face that curved 23 along 24 the 
paper. was it male or female. i saw a woman 
there and 25 said so. 26 he told me it 
could be either. i didn't understand the 27 significance 28 
of that particular test 29 reality : me showing up 
on his job 30 the blistering anger/anguish of summer. i 
want 31 him to take me and the child away 
from my 32 man 33 i want him to stake 
a claim. not ready at all 34 he avoids my 
eyes, cries about his wife and 35 her suicidal tendencies 
36 the doctor asks me what i am. i say, 
a non sequitur . he is 37 suddenly 38 afraid 
as i spew out my hatred. across the rug stamping 
39 angrily at 40 my absence from the nation's tomes. 
he shifts his glasses 41 uncomfortably 42 hands me a 
tissue for my tears, tells me he does not want 
43 me as a 44 patient. walks out. it's cold 
on the leather 45 reality : me running into him 
a couple of 46 years later, after his nervous breakdown 
and my 47 divorce. lust like yesterday cops a feel 
of 48 my ass, and it's to the motel for 
one of the good 49 old days. he's trying to 
make it back to the top 50 and it's my 
turn to do a fade 51 the apartment a fist 
closing round me. i go back to the 52 streets, 
call on 53 a few friends and assure them i'm 
okay and no longer 54 courting death. didn't 55 really 
need a doctor after all, now that i've finally found 
a 56 decent job
