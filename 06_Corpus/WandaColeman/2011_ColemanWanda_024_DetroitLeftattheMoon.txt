it was cool, quiet and nowhere

a fullness gone flat

i thought someone might want to see me

if not meet me—these days immortality rates are soaring

the competition more intense as ASAP programs give

birth (an assembly line?). there are more knowzits than ever.

young, devout, and DuSable—

tellin' us thangs.

there was hard dirty snow

a woman butt-naked caught

during a power outage (we are frequently

powerless these days)

Frieda slept here

i spread my tailfins and crawled

The Scarab, caught Diego on the rise, exited

sans orange shoe laces

saw two familiar faces

met a mistier self who in her fine efforts

to impress me upstaged me

those texts skin-stained and stinking of authentic rot

Lenin is turning over

aroused by Detroit Red gone El Hajj.

this is the city built then beaten by industry.

The Paris of the West may be wasted, but

at least the river runs water.

the sun hijacked and rammed into my expectations

(those Brown Bombers/how busted the All-American Cherry)

fresh in from the dream factory

blackness descending on blackness

the food has to be hardy to defend the bones

against the blight

that infamous day the roar of rubble

blackened Manhattan in midmorning

muted other urgencies

silenced/stilled other discontents

dwarfed a history of Septembers

Henry Ford's rusted-out leavings—

“the struggle”

placed in searing context

effort jarred

it is puny. it is mean and puny

you were cool, quiet, and nowhere

(why am i so brown? i was in the front row

when God passed out the Motown)
