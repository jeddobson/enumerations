bleakness settled across her shoulders but she

kept on babbling, in the kind of French they

speak in urban ghettos north of Capricorn.

sometimes she insinuated herself into a conversation.

sometimes she simply lit an unfashionable smoke.

a man in his jocks once asked her a silly question,

then they etched passion into the kitchen floorâ€”

hours spent in rough parallels of flesh juxtaposed

mixing hot bother with hotter issues.

the power of inkiness was at an oblique edge,

their very own Francis Bacon worth a golden gavel.

she truly believed in rainbows but with pots of stars

at the end of them where the obsidian waters of El Dorado

emptied into the Bay of Desire, and there

the last throb of his leaving was a splash

of images/sequin-eyed botflies darting against

the mirror of an opened heart.
