1 what is it about us 2 is it your 
hair unruly defiant sable 3 against the comb is it 
4 your half smile head cocked to the opposing shoulder 
5 your hazel eyes lowered to a come-on 6 certainly 
that big red tongue 7 certainly that big red throb 
i love to ride into 8 wild wild tremblings surrounded/cloaked 
9 in your numb lust 10 it is. yes indeed 
11 your i'm-coming-to-get-you walk 12 your arms ape-haired and held 
Â¾s high 13 focused on the object demanding ambulation 14 
recreating yourself with the cast-offs of civilization 15 finding magic 
in the discards of kinkiness 16 in me. is it? 
17 is it your heart unruly defiant 18 against my 
love is it 19 is it?
