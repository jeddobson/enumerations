1 once upon a time, i a poet, transformed myself 
into a poem 2 i was very happy 3 my 
line was intriguing and audacious 4 it could take many 
forms---a gun, a sword, a heart that 5 throbbed 6 
a hand gentle as a kiss 7 it could express 
any emotion i sought to convey, as well as 8 
i could master it 9 then one day i was 
published 10 now i do not know whether i am 
a poet writing a poem 11 or a poem writing 
a poet
