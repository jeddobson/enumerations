1 the assistant librarian was an old white woman 2 
with wattles hanging to her brittle neck. (a child 3 
of ten, i didn't think of them as characteristics of 
4 aging, only traits peculiar to her.) i couldn't help 
5 staring because i'd never noticed them on any 6 
person before---not that close up. i was also amazed by 
her 7 pinched magenta mouth and tweezed-then-penciled-in 8 brown eyebrows 
and how her bifocals magnified the 9 bigotry in her 
eyes as well as those dark amber lashes 10 her 
gray eyes policed me thru the stacks like dobermans 11 
she watched me come and go, take books and bring 
books 12 she monitored the titles and after a while 
decided 13 she'd misjudged her little colored girl 14 and 
for a time she tried to apologize in her way. 
to engage 15 in small talk. i never answered back. 
once, she set 16 special books aside to gain my 
trust respect smile 17 i left them untouched 18 hating 
her more for that
