1 the night was cold the Naugahyde was cold 2 
but his ass was colder 3 aromas of aqua velva, 
kool filter longs and 4 silver satin bitter lemon soaked 
the air 5 there was the red stain of razor's 
bless 6 to the left of his adam's apple. the 
stubble 7 of his 5 o'clock shadow scraped the softness 
8 above my left breast 9 the moon was howling, 
i swear, it was la loca moon 10 the jade 
dagger charm that dangled just at 11 his chest hairs 
12 from its fine braided gold chain 13 pierced my 
taffy-pull heart 14 i still cherish the ghost of the 
purple bruise 15 where his silver Alamo belt buckle 16 
painlessly caressed my virgin mambo thigh 17 yes. the moon 
was howling so it made the wind jealous 18 gene 
chandler crooned "there's a rainbow ..." 19 on the only 
station in town that radioed teen music. 20 he had 
to stop a moment to take out the wad 21 
of juicyfruit so we could French, tongues unimpeded 22 the 
spurs on his black leather boots jangled as 23 one 
scratched the door handle and the other 24 kept hitting 
the brake pedal 25 the remarkable fury of the moon 
howled on the vista 26 at that moment the twin 
suns of his eyes 27 rolled back into an eclipse. 
the stars disappeared 28 as the universe went dark. and 
slowly, light 29 returned glistening on the head of his 
30 left canine as he smiled my June glow 31 
in the aftershine, 32 he held me so tightly i 
swooned. 33 he woke me with kisses right there and 
said 34 they meant i was promised to him alone 
and always 35 so sudden 36 we felt the sacred 
presence of others in our honor 37 and knew 38 
we were haunted by those spirits 39 who had taken 
many cruises and joyrides 40 on the bald tires and 
hairpin curves of life 41 and then, as 42 we 
sweetly departed, that she-wolf moon howled after us 43 until 
it burst into a shower of lost names
