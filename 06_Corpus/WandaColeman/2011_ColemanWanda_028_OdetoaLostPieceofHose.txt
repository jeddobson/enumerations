o sock, where art thou? dear nubs-warmer gone missing.

alack! my tightly-wound universe is thrown into chaos

a just-removed sock unravels my psyche as i grope

for the actuality of its dislocation. twast here mere

seconds ago. must be here somewhere. tis still felt in hand

pliant, a soft blackness delicately patterned in pink

orange and mauve threads, embroidered jewels.

i should've never from my foot doffed it, but my big toe

required a rub to relieve the crush of boot leather against

the nail, and a quick clipping and filing to relieve

the pressures of malls, parking lots, hallways, and the

pacings of fluorescent classrooms or traversings

of quads. it isn't in my desk, my notebooks are pristine, not

a whit of evidence of aggressive nesting rodents. no cats.

in the jane i give myself a pat-down, search crack ’n’

crevice for that escapee on the sly. i dread the anticipation—

its dropping from a sleeve, sliding from under a pant leg,

or peeping from a pocket or fly (a well-zipped zipper

will prevent that, at least, i think as i triple check).

quickly, the deadline nears. and off to labor i must go,

planting knowledge twixt tender ears. to find that sock

or go stockingless into that interminable interval

confidence frayed, barefoot with a dusty sole
