It was 7 a.m. I was in a horrible hurry. 
There was no milk in the house for the kids. 
I rushed to a convenience store, found the dairy section, 
got a half gallon and zoomed to the counter. The 
clerk was a young Arabian man. He rang up the 
charge on the register. I went into my wallet and 
flashed all I had---a twenty dollar bill. It was early 
and he didn't want to part with any change. I 
got angry. I told him what he could do with 
his change and where he could stick what. I took 
my dignity and stomped out, leaving the milk and my 
twenty on the counter. Realizing my mistake, I went back 
and demanded the twenty. He baited me with it. I 
had to apologize for the nasty things I'd said if 
I wanted it back. I softened my eyes and apologized. 
I'm a handsome woman and he went for the okey- 
doke. He handed me the twenty. I let out a 
stream of brutal epithets. Shaken, he bucked his eyes and 
in uncertain English, tried to call me "nigger." I laughed 
all the way to the next store where I got 
my milk and got on with it.
