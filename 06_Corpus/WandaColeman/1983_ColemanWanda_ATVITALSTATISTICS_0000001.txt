hard to breathe hard to sit processed 1 minutes stretch 
into day's wait 2 the broadness/discomfort 3 of flesh in 
the pockmarked expanse 4 of beige tiles and rows of 
chairs stamped "recorder" 5 part of me follows the blue 
line 6 and part of me, the red 7 zombies 
stagger through doorways/slips 8 of paper in hand 9 conjured 
up by clerical hoodoos 10 hidden pasts 11 loved ones 
married buried born 12 daydream: passing through the exit down 
the escalator 13 that does not work to the grey 
cement 14 regions where stilled autos 15 await ignition 16 
in this mausoleum the hum of impatience 17 confinement 18 
boredom 19 vague rustle, a newspaper read a dozen times 
20 makes its way to the floor 21 it's done 
by computer. no mirrors here 22 this strange magic of 
certification/proof 23 of existence (we do not live until our 
papers 24 are stored, our numbers assigned)
