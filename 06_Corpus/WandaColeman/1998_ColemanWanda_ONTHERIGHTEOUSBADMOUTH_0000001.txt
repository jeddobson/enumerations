1 if i must be insulted do it like a 
Mestizo 2 in proper Spanish, under the spare ghost of 
a Joshua 3 somewhere in the bowels of California 4 
near the border, preferably, on the afternoon of a slam 
5 when my imperfect understanding will fail 6 and the 
painful ugliness descend on my awareness 7 like moist romantic 
kisses 8 or do it with Yiddishkite like an ex 
New Yorker 9 raised on charlotte russe & egg creme 
10 late one Hollywood afternoon at the best table 11 
in Musso & Frank's back room, while picking over 12 
cold boiled potato, mushy canned peas and onionless 13 meatloaf 
with a wide-tined fork between mumbled 14 complaints about shvartzers 
who don't know the score 15 if you must wellthendo 
the do in poison-furred 16 satin slurs like a butter-down 
wobble-necked bitch mama 17 fists-to-hips while the DJ samples sly 
wicked rhymes 18 between throws of house-rocking funk while the 
slick 19 crowd crocodiles 'tween swigs under red lights as 
20 i'm smoked high off whiffs of doo-wop riffs 21 
& the gleam of eyes so evil make the devil 
turn tail 22 if you must put it in my 
ear---lubricate
