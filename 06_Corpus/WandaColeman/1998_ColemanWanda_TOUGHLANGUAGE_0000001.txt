1 he complains i don't play it hardball enuff. he 
2 wants it slammed to the table like sirloin gouged 
from 3 a fresh kill still bleeding onto the hardwood. 
he 4 wants me to spike it in deep until 
shrieks 5 erupt like Krakatoa and rent white flesh gives 
way 6 lava running toward ocean's edge/steam and villages 7 
burning and the women children even the men running for 
8 shelter. or cold as that blue arctic beast that 
9 cracked and numbed the Titanic sinking all-American 10 hope. 
he wants to kick back and watch them all 11 
shiver/head for the useless lifeboats. he knows 12 there's a 
soulblack sub off the coast loaded with 13 relentless torpedoes---a 
one-woman lynch mob marauding 14 thru the streets of his 
mushy pampered academic boredom 15 robbing and raping her one-dimensional 
way across town 16 to shoot the sheriff and liberate 
him from himself
