potential employers stare, swallow, say nothing

there—once a part neatly indicative of the

comb and brush forever abandoned

here—childhood memories of sniggering

kids making fun of my stingy hair broken and burned to the scalp

there—a memory of the bulging eyes and

the revulsion of my mother, a teacher, the man who

refused to hire me to be his secretary

here—the wigs i used to wear to create the

illusion that my hair could grow in volumes

there—the teenaged boys who never invited me on dates

here—the words “nappy headed nigger bitch”

there—the children of others stare in fascination or

scream in fright

here—a critic once looked me dead in the head

and said it looked as if it were covered in pubic hairs

in my haste or while in tub or shower, a bud

of my hair is apt to break off, drawn earthward

in sistuhs it evokes amazement, shame, or pride

in bruthas it evokes amusement, consternation, or smiles

young Whites and Asians ask me how they can get their hair to do this

’n’ that. brown folk usually stare, but Latino men make passes

way beyond braids or thorns

threads within coils within knots within twists

call me Medusa. kiss the faces in my coif

o slightly furry Japanese beetle

sensing footfall, waits for the murderess to pass

eludes being crushed into eternity. oops!

o heavy piece of lint escaped from the vacuum cleaner

or clothes dryer. oops!

o the leaving of a creature too large to be a rodent

too small to be a cat. oops!

rescued from the shower drain, my lover fondly hands me a clump:

Irrefutable Evidence of The Difference Between Races



an untested loveliness weaves and winds

through these earth-toned tangles

my lover's hand gently pats and caresses—there

the serpents preen-and-curl against his palm

in the morning, he exits our bed cautiously
