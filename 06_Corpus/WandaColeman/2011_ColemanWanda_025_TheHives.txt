i am made of flame and sweat

day itch a hammer at my temple

my nails digging to tear the agony from my substance-bitten

feet, arms, back, thighs

night itch a blowtorch to my rib cage and innie

eyes widened with the will to not claw

do not rip off the skin do not make the sores

clip your tips to the quick and seek cool places

i am made of flame and sweat

“The world falls away”—sayeth the Queen of The Beats

and dollface my skin goes with it
