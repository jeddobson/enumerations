1 walking his halls---a wonder 2 explore shelves behind eyes---dusty 
tales of s. holmes 3 winter afternoons curled up inside 
his mouth 4 a history scrawled in knotted brows 5 
country winters his skin 6 his hands, leaves falling southern 
autumn 7 the endless canyon's cool blues of his smile 
8 lives. 1850 remembered. 1450 dreamed. 9 (the maidens in 
his fairytale are black instead of the 10 knights) 11 
poems gather, age, grow dry and brittle 12 crack beneath 
worn bitten nails 13 alone between the pages of his 
friends 14 reads love never found
