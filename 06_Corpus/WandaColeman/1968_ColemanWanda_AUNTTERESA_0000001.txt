1 there was vanity in her colored lady stiffness 2 
a fear of ashiness 3 her cedar skin glowed under 
carefully applied layers of 4 petroleum jelly 5 she smoked 
and talked sharp mannish 6 tough but must've been pretty 
soft to baby-sit in her 40s 7 she liked to 
play canasta and solitaire 8 used to sit at the 
dining table 9 dealing cards hard fast with a snap 
to the wood 10 while church-going, liked a lick of 
gin 11 and bet the horses 12 a bony thin 
snip of a woman 13 she drew mama's impatience and 
sometimes words 14 over discipline, price or time 15 we 
thought her funny and laughed and laughed 16 the time 
she got a female conk on her thin fine locks 
17 when lye permanents first came out for niggerish naps 
18 way back in the 50s 19 the next day 
all her hair fell out 20 unable to afford a 
wig, she went months 21 under a thin red hanky 
which ill-concealed 22 her egg-shaped bald cedar noggin 23 as 
shiny as her knee caps
