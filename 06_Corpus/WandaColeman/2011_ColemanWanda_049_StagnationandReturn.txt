freedom? moved forward but went backward

the sugar in the bloodstream

and these bombs going off in nogginland spur me

to minor acts of public aggression

(like at the post office) as i travel everywhere but never arrive.

i am responsible yet irreverent and totally irrelevant on this

birthscape. i have a fix and a hex on the problem.

i am taking an axe to the text (my hands are not only dirty,

they're arthritic) the only free ammunition is words, and

somebody up there (in the record company) is mastermind

tongue control—aborting discourse before it's born

i suffer/imagine being unable to feed myself. immobilized

and ignored by an indifferent keeper not much

my junior. shame—i can get arrested

before i can get recognized. this.

it's not that i'm innocent, just hamstrung and gut rung

justifying one existence for the sake of maintaining it
