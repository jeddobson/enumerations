1 there's an alley with my name on it 2 
cold gritty pavement 3 crushed glass 4 shadows 5 an 
occasional thin stray cat 6 hunting through overturned garbage cans 
7 old tin cans/beer cans/ketchup bottles 8 cigarette cellophanes 9 
bits of torn paper dancing on an eddy 10 foot 
falls stumbling past 11 lovers in the apartment across the 
way fucking 12 argument in the mack den 13 kids 
shooting pennies behind crates 14 in back of the liquor 
store 15 a few roaches trucking from the fumigated house 
to the one 16 across the street 17 drip drip 
of water from the drain 18 wind rises scattering stuff 
19 i will meet you there
