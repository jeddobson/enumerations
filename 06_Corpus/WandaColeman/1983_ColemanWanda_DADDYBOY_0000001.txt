is those big powerful black hands 43 home, he lectures 
us. brother and sister 44 should love and respect. at 
10 & 12 45 we're too big for such nonsense

to save my butt. i stuff my britches 48 with 
a book wrapped in a towel like i saw on 
tv 49 george is hot tears and snot. it's my 
turn 50 WHOP WHOP WHOP. i fake a boo hoo 
51 "what's this?" surprised he reaches in, pulls out 52 
the towel. the book thuds to the floor 53 he 
laughs and laughs so hard 54 he's almost crying and 
spanks me at the same time 55 and i'm laughing 
and crying and we're 56 laughing together 57 and shit 
does it hurt58 one terrible morning pop came home in 
a sweat 59 he'd gone to the shop as usual 
60 everything was gone. the printing presses 61 the desks. 
the files. the ledgers. every damn thing 62 his partner 
had ripped him off 63 "what we gonna do?" mom 
wailed 64 "i don't know" he said real quiet 65 
i went hot and cold 66 he paced the room, 
slammed open the door 67 and went back to the 
streets 68 it is the only time i've ever seen 
him cry 69 and they was killin' tears70 the phone 
screams. i jump up from my sleep 71 it's mama. 
can i come? papa's fallen 72 against the bathroom door. 
she can't get it open 73 she doesn't know if 
he's hurt 74 it's the seizures again brought on by 
scar tissue 75 from where they removed the tumor. yes 
76 i'm on my way. and as i'm about to 
leave 77 the phone rings again. no 78 i don't 
have to come. the boys are coming 79 she says

the hills of zion 82 for wednesday night prayer meet 
83 i'm long since a woman 84 he's long since 
grayed and grandfather 85 he goes into his wallet for 
the card and gives 86 it to me, his hands 
swollen/cushionoid with 87 illness. perhaps i'd like to come some 
time? 88 when i'm not too busy? they have a 
good choir. 89 i take the card, say okay say 
maybe 90 and wait patiently as he struggles 91 to 
get out of the car with the aid of his 
cane 92 and makes his way toward the light 93 
of the open door
