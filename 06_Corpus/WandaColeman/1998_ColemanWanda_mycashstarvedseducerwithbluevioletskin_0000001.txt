1 my cash-starved seducer with blueviolet skin 2 croons Alabama-tinged 
bossa nova over tall tan equatorial 3 lovelies strolling the 
white sands of bikini-laden 4 beaches where coconut palms nod 
sedately 5 beneath cloud-flecked azure the sun frying 6 neurons 
like high-grade hallucinogens 7 as he simultaneously hugs the mike 
and my thighs 8 locking my big browns with his 
big browns 9 making salacious promises to lick me into 
next week 10 but, jive on ice, we are chained 
in the brimstone 11 dungeon of passionate dada (dat sumpthin' 
wronginus 12 stronginus), flurried in our copious colloquy 13 on 
The Ultimate Answer---greed feeding greed---each 14 hoping the other knows 
the sideway up
