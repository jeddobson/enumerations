our hero smacked those liverlips and stared, took the blues dare

imperiously for there were no bitch eyes so rabid—so strangely

stridently beautiful that deserved to go unchallenged

glassy umber whirls like silt-stirred waters flecked with red

set in veiny jaundiced yellows

arrogant and statesmanly in his copasetic pose—jazzman by proxy

he would not look too deeply. fear of music kept his gaze

askim on their surface where he drifted above that

marblelike world enwombed by a dreadful tho speakable lust

all war and jizz and befuzzed

and so he cast his eyes askew, pretending to seize-and-size

betrayed only by a certain shallowness of breath

and the frosting over of his well-oiled and educated blackness

what he almost peeped was the torrential agony of a shewolf alone

tending her breed. the bitter tender rendings of tooth-and-claw

although he heard that prolonged howling—half wind, half quake—

felt it lance his wrist, shiv into to his fine southern marrow

(what he did not deign observe in those fierce orbs rolling

her three heads each with four eyes, two set correct—the one

in the back of her heads, and those solitary winkers in between

whoa! he denied his ears!

altho they arrived in time to give good listen

and so

he saw himself slip comfortably into that rude os, devoured—

a shredded soul, wordless, paralyzed—a mactation)

he loathed those low moanings. heard too late even as

he understood what it was of her that had inhabited him

what he almost saw in her pain might have saved him
