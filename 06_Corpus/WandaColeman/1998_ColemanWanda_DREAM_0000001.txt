1 playing the Central Avenue tour guide, i say, 2 
"dis here corner was where dat ol' chocolate chicken hawk 
3 used to swoop for guinea hens," as if i 
knew 4 a goddamned thang. then i describe the counter 
across 5 the street where The Black Assassins used to 
hang 6 as if i knew it intimately, having eaten 
at 7 Mama Washington's only twice or thrice, having been 
8 by her house on a couple of scoots, then 
'tween 9 Jefferson and Vernon, Spring morn 1969, Chuck Man 
10 stops for a bottle of V.O. and a plum-colored 
stingy 11 brim to match his jumpsuit. he makes me 
climb out 12 of Mustang Sally to follow him inside 
the liquorstore 13 to distract the counterman with my sexiness 
should 14 there be anything runnin' loose he wants to 
lift 15 the building's brick facade is bullet-riddled 16 the 
doors and jambs kicked violently askew 17 expended shell casings 
are scattered among pigeon feathers 18 and droppings, fallen leaves, 
the husks of spent carob 19 fruit and an ant-infested 
beetle carcass 20 site of the shootout between Big Mama, 
her robber sons 21 and police---first in the city's history. 
i tell any 22 part of the world willing to 
listen that they were 23 good folk at heart altho 
i was prejudiced 24 having had a crush on her 
youngest 25 slow-mo 26 mother forever poises at the kitchen 
doorway, 27 pint-sized pot in swollen dark left hand, right 
28 arm whipping that too-big wooden spoon 29 as she 
thins the oatmeal, warmed in milk, works in 30 brown 
sugar butter and a cinnamon kiss until 31 soft & 
creamy so father can eat without dentures 32 fast-fo 33 
my baby is in the backseat of the old Rambler 
34 station wagon and Kika's driving me to meet my 
lover 35 when we come up on all these cop 
cars & uniforms 36 blocking the streets and the alleys. 
next thing, we're 37 running for cover because the gangsters 
have come up 38 from behind us fall-auto for the 
freakdown. we're caught 39 in the crossfire. one of the 
shells bursts thru her 40 fleshy arm and i grab 
hold to her with one hand, 41 the baby snug 
in my other arm and everybody is screaming 42 "yo 
hey hello, Sis," young blood's all big tooth 43 all 
glistening naked glory scalp to inny belly button, 44 stopping 
at the jeans. i know it's time to get up, 
but my 45 lids are so thick with mucus i 
talk thru. my sleep. he 46 says "hello Sis" again 
in case i didn't hear his 47 first welcome. then 
his friend, the cinnamon girl, throws 48 my book at 
me, says "some of the students don't relate," 49 and 
i say "game, it's about appreciation not applause" 50 the 
buses are always vengefully full 51 and never stop, yet 
52 i have awakened to find myself 53 wilting on 
a street corner 54 in late summer's night heat, 55 
clad only in a pink push-up bra 56 and beige 
sack dress, vulnerable 57 to the leers of cowboys in 
patrol cars 58 who know i'm fated to never get 
59 where i'm hoping 60 and that no one will 
be home 61 by the time i make bail
