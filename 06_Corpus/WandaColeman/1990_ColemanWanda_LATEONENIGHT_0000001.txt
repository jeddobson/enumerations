1 two weeks before her obituary appeared i was sitting 
2 in the dark round back of the Parisian room 
debating 3 on whether or no to go in and 
catch her show or go home 4 sit alone stewing 
in mah-man-of-woe-don't-want-no-mo 5 when the side door back of the 
bar-be-que joint opened 6 up and out steps this long 
tall woman in a straw stetson 7 gray blouse and 
slacks and cowboy boots carrying a 8 brown paper bag 
i recognize Big Mama Thornton i figure 9 she's totin' 
ribs in red sauce and it makes me hungry 10 
it's been over fifteen years since i caught her act 
at a 11 San Francisco blues joint and she's lost 
a lot of weight 12 all the fat round jelly 
gone (mis'ry slim a legend to 13 a whisper, i 
thinks) and she sees me watching her and 14 nods 
a sistuhly hello i nod back and start to speak 
15 but think bettah not considering my do-evil mood may 
16 embarrass myself and i get out and go in 
to enjoy her 17 show but not before i cop 
some of them ribs
