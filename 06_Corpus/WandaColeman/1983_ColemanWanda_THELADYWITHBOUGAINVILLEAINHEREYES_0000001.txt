1 cries death her father 2 cancer eats away at 
the family 3 a brother who'd rather forget 4 memories 
of harsh words glisten like 5 garnets 6 cool crisp 
hospital walls close in 7 and mother, a shrieking harpy 
silenced by 8 pending shadow of the scythe, returns 9 
thank you notes for flowers 10 oh, this mouth of 
pain 11 this moth that lunges to be free of 
cocoon 12 she enters, long black hair kissing worried shallow 
cheeks 13 in three-inch stacked heels, upon the stage 14 
this poet-vamp clasps her arms at the elbows. in the 
15 quiet of the lobby whispers "daddy you s.o.b. i 
love you" 16 and sinks into the folds of her 
heart 17 "keep fighting, we're all pulling ..." 18 home, 
oh this house of pain 19 and in and out 
the neighborhood swoop 20 victims looking for victims/madness, the 21 
furtive moon appears on her doorstep 22 threatening rape 23 
and three blocks away the love of her life 24 
drinks their future into oblivion 25 while she fights lust 
26 for the needle's plunge, remembering 27 "daddy needs me 
to be straight" 28 and oh, the pain 29 would 
that she be in mexico, mainlining cocaine 30 languishing in 
the plaza of lost loves 31 her heart exploring catacombs 
of the dead 32 where she would go to meet 
her father 33 among conquerors
