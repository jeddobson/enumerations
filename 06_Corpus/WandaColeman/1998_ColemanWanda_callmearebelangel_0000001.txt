1 call me a rebel angel 2 firstborn & full-time 
resident of lower hell 3 my eyeballs are shot thru 
with the heavy crimson 4 blood of an honest race. 
my skin is musky dusky--- 5 wings shriveled useless lacquered 
to my back by 6 generations of theopathy (o perverse 
astasia). i be 7 large-lipped prodigal oracle of nappy assignations 
8 the long shadow of my psychosexual dehumanization 9 blotting 
out all suns. i rule agony's pit 10 Dis messenger! 
i have heard you blow 11 treble treble roil and 
revel 12 and would rise to dance in the millennium. 
but 13 my feet fail me. now. so edematous 14 
i can't force them into my Tiffany slippers
