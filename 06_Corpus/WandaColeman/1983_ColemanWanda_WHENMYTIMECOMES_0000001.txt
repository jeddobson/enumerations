1 i will speak to the night. it will listen 
2 words faint as breath 3 a door thru which 
i escape/another world 4 imagination carries me 5 i am 
light, float/smoke/waft 6 this dance on the killing floor of 
spirit 7 light one candle and move on 8 oboe 
my mouth turned inward 9 dream i am possessed by 
the dream: arrival 10 the fire 11 my skin peels 
off, beneath it soft moist black earth 12 mother the 
candle bums slow 13 communicate? it's hard to talk 14 
difficult to sculpt 15 the flame gives off no warmth 
16 the many ways i spell hate on every empty 
wall 17 when my time comes 18 i will speak 
to the night 19 it will rise 20 and follow
