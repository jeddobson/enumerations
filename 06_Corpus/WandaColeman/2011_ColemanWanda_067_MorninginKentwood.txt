each 4 a.m. i wake to write, make

licorice tea in the kitchen, bleary

with nightdreams and wantings

the light still on out back

anticipating the return of baby

boy, who, unbeknownst to me, is

inside his apartment snoring,

having forgotten to kill the light.

in our bedroom, you, too, are snoring

but turning now and then to speak

to a phantom or caress a figment

mug in dark hand, i drift into my swivel

chair, assaulted by actions images words

(our children o how they slay our children)

opening to them sluggishly until the

warmth takes hold. i woogie at the

futility but am compelled nevertheless

ditching the rage that comes cheaply

letting it splash and spin until i soften

the phone is silent, yet i hear callings

on the distance, gone voices

coming in on the offshore chill

how, i think, will i keep my promise?

then i hear the owl's serenade at moonset

lifting deft hands, i drift into reverie

lay down the things described on

canvas and in clay: spooning nakedlyâ€”

you doing to me those things described

by history by philosophy by poetry.

when i get up twenty years have

passed. it is 11 a.m. and time to

make breakfast in the kitchen. fresh

from my visitations, i hastily go

about waking the dreamers,

know they will follow the aroma

when the cooking is cookin'

still i see nightdreams and wantings

the light still on out back
