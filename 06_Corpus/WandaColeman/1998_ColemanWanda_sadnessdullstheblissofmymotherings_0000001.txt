1 sadness dulls the bliss of my motherings 2 and 
sometimes when i feel the first ache of new menses, 
3 weeping for my children blues me over. it's then 
when 4 i retrieve cries from cradles out beyond the 
edge of years 5 hughughug and realize that somewhere 6 
in this immense complexity of trial and effort 7 i 
couldn't feed 'em proper even when i starved 8 myself. 
i couldn't draw a man to fill 9 the void 
called daddy. i couldn't be daddy. 10 i couldn't earn 
a daddy's pay 11 sometimes the walls shout snot and 
whisper and 12 there's tremblings down in my sorry boots. 
i am 13 ever the woman with little to offer 
save 14 leavings of her manic frothings which, when 15 
dropped to earth, are absorbed without trace
