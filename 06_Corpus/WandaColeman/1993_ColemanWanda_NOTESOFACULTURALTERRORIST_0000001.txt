1 after the war the war begins the war goes 
on 2 i am a soldier. look at my boots 
3 soles worn from seeking work. from hours 4 in 
unemployment lines 5 call me a civilian casualty 6 the 
war to feed children the war to clothe their backs 
7 the war to meet the rent the war to 
keep the gas tank 8 full the 9 war to 
end the calculated madness keeping the poor poor 10 what 
happens to a war deferred 11 does it implode? does 
repressed aggression 12 ravage the collective soul? 13 (there's rioting 
now. i see the blaze red smoke rising. 14 the 
city burns. people are looting, taking things. all the 15 
excess denied them. crimes of possession. to have. without 16 
the onus of color or fear of rejection. children carry 
racks 17 of clothes. women push shopping carts brimming with 
food. 18 men favor liquor stores and gunshops. but what 
we need is 19 revolution. bloodless or otherwise. we must 
go deeper than 20 lust gratified in one spontaneous torrid 
upsurge of rage) 21 i am a soldier. look at 
my hair 22 fallen out under stress. the many hours 
23 unappreciated on the job. not even a decent chair 
24 call me collateral damage 25 and when all the 
foreign battles are won 26 will we who battle here 
at home 27 have our day in democracy's sun? 28 
(i am laying on the gurney in the hallway. there 
29 aren't enough beds. he's been here with me for 
hours and 30 we came in last night. and they 
still haven't been able to 31 tell us anything. they 
wanted money up front before they 32 even talked to 
us. luckily we had assistance but still had to 33 
borrow from mama to make the cash co-payment. the pain 
is 34 real bad and i'm thirsty. but they said 
not to drink anything/ 35 nothing by mouth. and we 
had to wait forever just to get this 36 far. 
too many patients and not enough doctors) 37 i am 
a soldier. but my back is broke 38 battling the 
papers i push all day. my hope 39 is broke 
too. how do i love 40 call me politically correct 
41 (we sat in the bar in the late afternoon 
trying to figure out 42 where all the men had 
gone. the ones that weren't dead or 43 in jail. 
who loved women. the ones who weren't junkies 44 weren't 
alcoholics weren't already married. the ones who 45 love our 
color. and one sistuh took a tall swig and said 
46 she'd be satisfied if she lived to see her 
refrigerator full 47 just once before she departs this planet) 
48 what happens to a war deferred 49 does it 
seep down into the skin a rash 50 of discontent 
to erupt again and again? 51 i am a soldier. 
that i live is a lie 52 no one stares 
'cuz no one cares. grasping 53 for a nip of 
pleasure a toke of sanity 54 call me a victim 
of victims 55 (the cuffs are tight. i can feel 
them rubbing against my 56 wrists behind my back. we're 
taken out to the squad car 57 in front of 
all the neighbors. the kids stare at us. they 58 
knew we were different all along. we didn't belong in 
this 59 'hood. he's angry. he wants to know who 
ratted. i can't feel 60 anything but numb. they shove 
him into the back first and 61 then i climb 
in behind him. it's a short drive to the 62 
precinct. we're broke. we'll have to borrow money for 63 
bail. we're about to find out who our real friends 
are) 64 whatevah you do 65 don't look me too 
long in the eyes
