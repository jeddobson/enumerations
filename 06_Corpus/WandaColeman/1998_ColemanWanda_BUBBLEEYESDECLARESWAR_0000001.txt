1 this is the side i am forever on 2 
arms were taken up at Avalon & Manchester 3 on 
a school ground two score & five years ago 4 
i am still fighting the absent horde 5 of fairer-skinned 
mockers 6 who would not play with me because i 
was too dark 7 who stole my revengeful reports to 
God 8 & passed them around 9 & my writings 
caused so much disruption & 10 hurt so many mean 
little feelings that the 11 white teacher man had to 
intercede 12 to quell the violence, to dab away the 
angry tear 13 remove the fists from my hard-pressed head 
14 then when, skirts flying, they had returned 15 to 
4-square and double dutch 16 he took me aside privately, 
stared at me 17 with those great wide gray eyes 
18 then laughed, said i had quite a gift 19 
to keep such papers at home or face 20 the 
principal & suspension & that some day, 21 if i 
had the conviction & the courage 22 i'd give something 
great back to my people
