1 you rode into town on a mighty tall horse, 
Durango 2 and now it's time for that last showdown 
3 and the townspeople who sired you 4 have all 
turned against you 5 in their arrogance ignorance and fear 
6 and the subject of your love 7 is as 
fickle as the wind 8 and you're punch-drunk as a 
skunk in a trunk 9 looting and shooting for pleasure---tearing 
up 10 their peace of mind 11 and they're all 
too scared to take you on--- 12 the gutless lot 
of 'em 13 and you're too bitter and fed up 
with the bad hand 14 fate has dealt you in 
the form of black skin 15 and deadly aim 16 
it's time to get out of town, Durango 17 time 
to get the first thang smokin' 18 go on and 
get on 19 to whatevah is waitin' in that wild 
wild way out yonder 20 time to take that long 
slow technicolor ride 21 before they ambush you in the 
saddle 22 and leave you face up in the sun
