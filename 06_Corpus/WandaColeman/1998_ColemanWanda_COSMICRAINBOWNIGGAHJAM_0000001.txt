1 too soon in this noon of noons 2 the 
pianist in piss-soaked socks & loafers 3 stumbles over his 
militant hands 4 his, the remarkable squish 5 of a 
latent score/dribble music 6 imported dark beer was had for 
breakfast 7 followed by a spate at the 8 ancient 
art known as lifting one's head 9 out of a 
plate. everything smells of good warmness, 10 soul women, on 
their ways to man lesser bureaucracies, 11 click their heels 
with authority, chins up, icy 12 officious shoulders, breasts full 
mast, 13 ignore this specter spilling himself across their light 
14 too soon to be so drunk and so forgotten 
15 like the crisp clipped reed solo at 3 a.m. 
no one hears 16 except the pigeons below. 17 chance 
him to lose his fingering 18 entangled in spiritual lacings 
19 spinning toward pavement 20 thudding on the nostalgia of 
promises blown like spit 21 from a chorus of cruel 
thin lips 22 too soon this noon of noons 23 
it is 100Â° for all the shades 24 turning to 
steam inside their skins
