1 (but you see, when we discuss birds 2 you 
must understand. i didn't know she was cuckoo) 3 on 
the night it happened he awakened from a 4 very 
deep sleep 5 (and though we hung with the same 
flock 6 from time to time we weren't that close. 
she 7 made their breaking up sound like the usual 
8 hen-rooster thang) 9 she had gotten out of bed 
without his knowing 10 (she knew she'd have my sympathy. 
she tried 11 to straighten it, telling me she loved 
him down 12 to the tail bone. he was a 
nigger artist 13 after all. her nigger 14 my erroneous 
translation: she supported 15 his sad bad habits) 16 they'd 
smoked a joint and made love 17 you know how 
that goes 18 (but you see, when we discuss birds, 
i was the 19 pigeon. she told me he wouldn't 
be faithful 20 knowing i'd assume the worst and indict 
him based 21 on my own negative experience with like 
type 22 the muthafuckin' bloodsucker) 23 years later 24 the 
truth winged by 25 on the song of a sparrow 
26 he couldn't stay with her after that. knowing what 
27 she was. he couldn't take it 28 (she sure 
played me for a turkey) 29 one night he woke 
from a deep sleep. she'd left 30 his side. he 
listened for her absence and in the 31 closeness of 
the tiny apartment he heard the flutter 32 of bodies 
in the bed across the way and heard 33 the 
whine of her six year old 34 "don't play with 
my pee-pee, mommy. i don't play with 35 yours"
