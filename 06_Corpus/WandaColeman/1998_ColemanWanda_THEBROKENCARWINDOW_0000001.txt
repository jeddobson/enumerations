1 our shocked eyes pierce 2 sudden indigo at 3 
the appearance of space in its absence 4 as if 
it were our getouttheghetto hopes 5 splattered into hundreds of 
starry chunks of 6 safety glass/the crossfire of angers 7 
hushed instantly by the shatter as if the 8 passenger 
window was burst by 9 bullets instead of the thick 
metal knob of 10 drive-in speaker head. he was 11 
too upset, jiggling with the key and faulty ignition 12 
and i was too busy racing the high-powered engine 13 
of my pregnant wife mouth. so neither 14 he nor 
i took notice that it was still there. the 15 
flicks were over and it was sitting 16 mute witness 
to our distraction/the scorching 17 dissatisfactions blistering our butts 18 
like the steam of California sun cooked into 19 the 
asphalt/our hearts 20 heads sluggish and logy and red-eyed 21 
with reefer working its mojo on our groins. 22 i 
wanted to recapture the dirtynasty 60s thrills 23 i never 
had, me being too black ugly a womanchild 24 for 
high school boys to date. he wanted to go home 
and 25 do it in bed like proper married folk
