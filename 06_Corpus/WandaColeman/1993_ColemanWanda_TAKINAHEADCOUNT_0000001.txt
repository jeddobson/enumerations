1 we gather 2 tome-on-tongue the bad verse of 3 
commiseration. one by one the stars wink shut (so 4 
eventually hebben won't shine thru) 5 some kind of hushed 
news spoken prayer-like 6 the fallen the proper context/respect as 
we recall 7 console count and catalogue 8 get into 
serious nod 9 the dead before time the dead by 
social decree 10 wasted by degree 11 (the soap box 
contains soap. wash 12 your mind) 13 we moan. we 
stomp our terrible prose. express 14 our woes in the 
mystic polemics of soul 15 say oh man oh man 
16 blessed existence 17 so bleak even light is absorbed
