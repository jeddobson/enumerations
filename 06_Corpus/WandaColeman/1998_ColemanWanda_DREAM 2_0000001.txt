1 my slim pale blond lover fondles my locks as 
2 i go down on him, notice the mushroom birthmark 
3 against his alabaster skin/his golden triangle. blue eyes 4 
roll back in his head, arms lifting in fright as 
the 5 brittleness shocks his chest and stops his throbbing 
6 at the Italian bistro the randy Mexican youth 7 
serves caffe lattes, his blue-black mane cut back 8 against 
delicious pierced lobes hung with gold hoops 9 he stops 
to caress 10 my gorgon hair my body twists into 
an angry coil 11 my mouth a sepia screaming slash 
12 he turns white and crumbles like ancient plaster 13 
the sister of the Chinese boy comes for me. he's 
14 seen my rage and has killed himself to express 
his own 15 and to liberate me from my democratic 
curse 16 she shows me the violent site/blood on gray 
stone 17 she hands me the white beach towel 18 
i kneel and sop up his spill 19 on this 
waking my lover snores beside me. i pull back 20 
the covers and watch the sunrise
