1 the sensation of falling 2 itself is not unpleasant. 
it is the thought of inevitable 3 trauma on impact 
that causes my stomach to scramble 4 throatward. i see 
my body slammed 5 against/onto an unyielding darkness. i anticipate 
6 that instant of great relevance after which some 7 
discussion may ensue as to my meaning or lack thereof 
8 not that i'm now of much pertinence. there are 
no nets 9 to break my fall. nothing to grab 
hold to 10 i plummet 11 flailing proves wasted effort. 
better to relax into it 12 which takes tremendous self 
control. did i 13 trip? was i pushed? certainly mine 
is no accident 14 my body is in definite downward 
motion the momentum 15 stunningly apparent 16 certain conclusions must 
be drawn in my effort to accept 17 the imminent 
(oh Humpty was it like this?). will my pain 18 
be merely essentialistic? perhaps i will simply burst 19 into 
a sweet nothing 20 or will i linger dreadfully after 
21 in searing awareness of my diverse parts, agonizing 22 
a futile reunion to presumed wholeness
