i'm thinking about a love i have never owned,

drenched in the madness of a man who has never

let me love him, nor has he fully loved me.

he is as close as an argument. he is as close as

the dirt under my nails. he smells of dark closets

and babushkas mopping the floors of The Tzar. he is

the Mecca of my pain, bearded and lust-lidded,

stooped by lechery and time. he never sleeps. as

morning waxes he counts my dreams, barks at them

in his guise as wolfhound. our survival has dwindled

down to “at any price.” my pride and my shame ride

me—those twin witches—as i fight the dust, the debts,

and the rude distractions, as i move to shake God from

heaven, to win the means and right to live on without

him. i am consumed by a love i have never owned.
