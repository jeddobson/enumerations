we and me on a go-and-see trip up to the 
promo pow-wow the movie producer has done a comic kowtow 
the place is done in phony smiles business cards and 
spineless guile we wade thru the shades and slicks to 
do our do see who is who and maybe baby 
if the vibes are right there might be a sexual 
liaison tonight i'm strung out on excess success and slightly 
short on glib finesse but i try my shot at 
a connexion keeping business business for my protection i'm sipping 
champagne fizz when mister movie man gets it up to 
give us his impression of semi- artistic smart-mouth expression when 
an album cover floats by and a pyramid of cocaine 
catches we's eyes we leaves me and goes out back 
while i sit and play social pitty-pat i think it's 
really nice to snack and chat and sip but this 
kind of crowd gives me a natural fit i locate 
we say it's time to split put-out cuz i didn't 
get my share of the hit put-out cuz i didn't 
want to be publically snooped doin' it and that little 
booze buzz scored wasn't worth shit
