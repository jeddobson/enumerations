I am The Queen of My Mirror if not Egypt.

There I am, the face I have loved forevah.

Talk about creamy foundation? Let it shine.

Ummm, Mama, that's the best pose yet!

Baby come over here and give me Some More.

Spare the blush and spoil the complexion.

What gloss stick we gonna slay ’em with tonight?

Darlin'! Almond gotcha eyes, lips that can't quit.

Eyeball to eyeball, lookylooky, make ’em pop ’n’ roll.

Friendgirl, Sweetmeat, Honey bunch and hush.

Let me see that smile, woman, profile, pro-file!

You the queen of this here mirror if not E-gypt,

In the front row when Ra passed out the razz.
