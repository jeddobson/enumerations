She was browsing through the shelves, looking for items of 
need. She usually sent the kids to the corner liquor 
store, but there were some things one had to be 
an adult to purchase, and she didn't feel like taking 
time to write a note subject to the lazy misinterpretation 
of some resentfully underpaid clerk. She need- ed some aspirin. 
She needed toilet paper. She needed some cookies for dessert. 
She needed a packet of safety pins. She needed a 
friend to talk to. She needed a good fuck. Slowly 
she selected the items available on the shelves, musing over 
the lat- ter two. She didn't have a man and 
she didn't have a telephone. As she stopped she became 
aware of the flagrantly sexual jazz fusion bursting from strategically 
mounted speakers. It's makin' my ears wet , she thought. 
I've got to have that . At the counter she 
asked the clerk who the artist was. "Oh, that's Roy 
Ayers---on his latest album." She memorized the name as he 
rang up her piddling little score on the register. He 
watched her slyly, study- ing her breasts. She looked at 
him. "Say, Baby---", the big brown barrel-chested clerk grinned, "how 
much do you cost?" She took offense, "I ain't no 
whore!" she said as she snootily grabbed her bag of 
sundries. He leered and barked after her as she fled 
from the store. "I know what you are. You think 
you too good to sell it . You prob'bly givin' 
it away to some niggah now. You nuthin' but a 
chippie. A chippie!"
