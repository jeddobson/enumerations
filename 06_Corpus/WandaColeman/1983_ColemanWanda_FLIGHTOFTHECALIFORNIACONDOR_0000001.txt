1 wind sistuh blooded eyes 2 mind full of flesh 
3 womb/dark moist 4 unknown walls suck you 5 so 
deep down 6 you become lost 7 die there 8 
what the eyes tell him he senses, the way the 
rabbit pursuit 9 descent out of sky, claws/talons--- snatch . 
he's 10 helpless, midair, familiar ground gives way this alien 
sky 11 ahead, the nest and death. he is fed 
to the young 12 breaker breaker 13 this is the 
hollywatts kid comin' at yah 14 steadily they grow. strong, 
vibrant, vital. they curl and 15 uncurl, test their environs. 
cry of discovery. something 16 inside hungers to wing free 
17 at the party the wealthy white bridge 18 champion 
followed me from one chair to the 19 next. "tell 
me what did I do? what did I do? 20 
the three black ones i loved hurt me 21 what 
did i do? they took my money 22 and left. 
why?" 23 here on this plain, constant thunder. no rain. 
the sky 24 seems pregnant, about to burst, enraged. but 
no. only the 25 splash-lash of lightning opening up comers 
of the room 26 dispelling shadows for a second. long 
into day it can be heard 27 for miles---thunder/the heart 
embedded in the groin of fear 28 at the office 
he came to tell me how much 29 we had 
in common. classical music, 30 writing, intelligence. "if 31 you'll 
forgive me, we must be soul mates," 32 and in 
his eyes and in his wife's eyes the 33 mattress 
waited, convulsed with our flesh 34 entwined. taste of me 
on his tongue, and hers 35 what would it be 
like entering me, fucking 36 my soul. i said no. 
he tried to get me fired 37 wing spread like 
a condor. the multicolored feather coat. rare 38 bird this. 
it burns/an unanswered question, is as inaccessible 39 as the 
planet's heart, preens and struts, avoids capture. like the 40 
horizon---is never reached 41 break into me, break into me 
42 this earth has never been violated 43 it expands 
to welcome, closes 44 clangs/bolts/lockup 45 in county jail 46 
imprisoned, he moves 47 to tear free 48 like quicksand, 
she appears harmless, ordinary, calm. he 49 didn't recognize until 
he was up to his nose in her, seeing 50 
too late. either to be pulled suddenly, violently free or 
51 expire in that hole 52 it labors. contracts. gives 
out. 53 screams dance in her lungs 54 pepper the 
page 55 so many ink blots/a drop 56 on him 
shrivels him up like 57 a slug under salt 58 
"if i had known i was going to die in 
california, i'd never have 59 come here," his few belongings 
hastily packed. the guitar across 60 his back. taking a 
vacation, not knowing there would be nothing to 61 come 
back to except his old army picture dangling from the 
62 bedroom 63 wall. she would be gone and all 
traces of their life together 64 there's nothing delicate here. 
delicate 65 things do not survive. they get beaten up/raped/shot/ 
66 runover/knifed/poisoned or pushed into suicide 67 they harden, become 
brittle, or bend 68 baked under sun of years, adobe 
will not 69 yield to crop, but brick to build--- 
70 where the farmer fails, the architect prospers: a city 
71 (one day we will plow you under and dance 
the ritual of your 72 passing) 73 under quicksand she 
waits. how long before he discovers 74 it's a movie 
prop/emerges a bit confused, perhaps embarrassed but 75 alive to 
find the treasure of her embrace, test passed 76 successfully. 
but he drops to her feet a corpse/choked on fear 
77 angrily she rewrites the script for the next actor 
78 i am dressed in a thin lavender negligee 79 
crouched behind the door. he moves past me onto 80 
the porch to see if i've escaped. spits a curse 
81 and stomps drunk, upstairs. i flee. the children/he 82 
won't hurt the children, can't hurt the children 83 but 
he'll kill me so i run, feet bare against 84 
sidewalk/glass rock bottle cap bite my feet 85 draw blood. 
i run to brother love's 86 beat on his door 
until he stirs. he allows me 87 sanctuary and the 
employ of his tub 88 break me open, break me 
open 89 white on the outside, rich warm chocolate inside 
90 these streets are lean, familiar faces in bitter forms 
that 91 dot doorways, cluster at corners, weave along the 
walk. i know 92 the pimp, the pootbutt, the whore, 
the worker, the blind, the 93 cowboy, the ditty-bop, the 
gangster, the hype, the hustler, the 94 young whites who 
visit the old whites who couldn't make the 95 flight 
96 exiled, the ghetto becomes home 97 the adjective bank 
is empty 98 the seer's tongue ensconced in 99 a 
coat of cryptic truths 100 her fingers/talons wet with 101 
blood of capture 102 having plucked him from 103 the 
desert's floor 104 mother of angels let me burn forever 
in the oven of your love
