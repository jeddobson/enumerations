1 he's two nights gone for the second 2 time. 
two weeks before that he left 3 the rehab house 
and they wouldn't take 4 him back. that was two 
years after he 5 left the penitentiary and broke two 
6 hearts when he was paroled to my custody 7 
on the condition of marriage. but it 8 would only 
take a couple of months before 9 he started backsliding, 
picking up the 10 old habits, old homies, old tracks. 
11 it got to be too much for me and 
i was 12 two jumps from killing him when 13 
he split. last time we made love was to 14 
that Doors song of like refrain. now 15 that he's 
gone all i seem to do is 16 remember how 
good the two of us got 17 when we put 
one-and-one together
