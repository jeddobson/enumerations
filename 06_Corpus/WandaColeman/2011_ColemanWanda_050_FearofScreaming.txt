who says. why? what!?

don't let me start

suppressed knives/teethlike flashings

fists against flesh raising bruises

and questions re stability â€¦ the

ripped things writhing on the comfort's

surface/rage magnified until cracks appear

without a harsh word or harsher touch

something ruptures and runs to the floor stinking

as it stains

don't let me start

who said what. who said. what?

sorry. sorry. sorry

eeeeeeeeeeeee
