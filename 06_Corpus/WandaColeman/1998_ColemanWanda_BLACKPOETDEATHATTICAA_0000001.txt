1 maybe if i had grown up white in Tulsa 
2 thangs would've been diff but i might've 3 been 
too happy to be poetic or too sad 4 or 
simply sad without the sturm demanded by 5 those who 
know poesy best. excuse my grope, 6 god, but i 
want to give it a name. something 7 like Geronimo 
or Castro or Cagliostro. i want to 8 salute at 
the tomb of the Known Soldier. 9 i want to 
do something anti-poetic like the 10 ending of an overcooked 
hotdog when there's 11 nothing but mustard on the too-dry 
bun. 12 i know god don't like whining over the 
clowns 13 and thugs who have it sweet. but i 
can't help 14 it. so cure my ham. so give 
me something to 15 brag about that isn't so different 
the rest 16 of the vox populi can appreciate me. 
something 17 trite and neuron numbing like frontier town 18 
in Dizzywizzyland. or like that niggah robe who 19 flushed 
his folk down toilet for a political 20 squat at 
the right tit of justice. tell me 21 i'm gone 
jabberwocky, god, to want some dumb 22 thing really the 
same as what everyone else 23 has got. something really 
conformist really--- 24 no shame something that'll pay the piano 
note 25 because nobody will misdo me anymore. 26 yeah 
27 somethang like those love-gangsta coons, the ones 28 most 
everyone finds so shitlicious 29 (perhaps in another time i 
might've 30 discovered the rainbow Moebius) 31 god, when i 
live i hope it's poetic sort of 32 like Al 
Green passing out ruby roses to swooning 33 middle-aged color-struck 
mamas or like immortality 34 finding Fred Hampton on the 
lips of the enraged 35 or like the jade of 
TV's cash-for-pander. some strange 36 chance or freak incident might 
rouse me from my 37 slumber but that would seem 
too ordinarily natural. 38 a quiet waking. uneventful. no fanfare. 
no bullets. 39 nichts 40 but snores and the blinking 
of the soul
