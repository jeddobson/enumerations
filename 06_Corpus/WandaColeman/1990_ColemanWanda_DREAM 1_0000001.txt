1 walking barefooted thru the streets in a trance, i'm 
in my thin 2 lacy worn lavender gown which ill-conceals 
my brown breasts. 3 it is sunny and warm 4 
my hair is grown long 5 and processed into a 
mop of glossy black straw which hangs to 6 my 
waist. there's something wand-like in my hand. it's alive. 7 
it's a thick double-headed fleshy yellow-red penis. i work it

baseball cap yells, "hey lady, 14 get out of the

continue to walk, speaking intelligently 19 in words i can't 
decipher. suddenly, the editor 20 expresses amazement and i snap, 
"that's reality," turning toward 21 her so awkwardly i drop 
the penis. it rolls away across the 22 blacktop into 
a pile of newly mown grass. i run over and 
retrieve 23 it. it is 24 covered in grass blades. 
as i hurry home to wash it off 25 i'm 
intercepted by a Latin American politico in the lobby of 
the 26 library. as the alarm goes off, he hands 
me a flyer and asks if 27 i'll please come 
and do a reading
