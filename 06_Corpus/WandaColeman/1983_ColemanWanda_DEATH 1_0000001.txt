1 night's voyage/his eyes my dream 2 our kiss circular 
rhythms of tongues 3 and teeth in passion's dance 4 
express a kindred hunger 5 in his wake 6 cold 
lonely dawn and damp sheets 7 it's the year of 
cocaine and coors 8 crazed blond men and confused black 
men 9 hear the bay of the she-hound gone mad 
10 casting off her domesticity, running with wolves 11 and 
that moon 12 oh ugly eye of ash moon
