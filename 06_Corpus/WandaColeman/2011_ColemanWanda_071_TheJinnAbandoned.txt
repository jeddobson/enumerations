love him, love his troubles

1)

streetwise, scorching eyes and ass as he moves/

a rude bleeder

having escaped a generation of Aladdins

bruise-colored skin, he appears upstairs to take me in a puff

i do not know that only half of his heart is African

his ambivalence a mystery until i meet his haunted mother,

his house full of women, his mestiza fianc√©e

it's not about the pursuit of things, it's about hoodoo & wicks

2)

the new man waits for me

he whispers his newness as he waits

dreams me a passion, commands the air

dreams me his black-fleshed woman with fire for eyes

dreams me back to Homo erectus

dreams me the thunder ride

and i materialize half-formed

he waits with rock-hard patience as the years roll and crest/a sea

shaping a reef of corrosive lust and vituperations

(he plots revenge burnings, as if i'm not charred enough)

he waits while i love others, am pursued by others, am ruined by others

now i am bride to a displaced ardor, the wish who has betrayed him

now he rubs the lamp day into night for a return to the fiction

and if not, to lose himself in a season of smoke
