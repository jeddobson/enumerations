1 'twas El Se√±or made me do it---recalling my offering 
2 a newly minted silver dollar, a dove cigarette 3 
and scotch sampler 4 or perhaps 5 the grinning skeleton 
with his candy apple heart 6 throbbing bold thru ribs 
bleached by this desert swelter 7 or the news whispered 
over the phone 8 i heard Sister Karen died, now 
who will do the work? 9 we were not friends 
but i remember her 10 from those protest days 11 
before she stopped wearing her full habit 12 i was 
drawn there, he took me there, even tho i knew 
13 i looked out-of-place 14 was cranky down to the 
ovaries 15 didn't want to see 16 anybody i knew, 
tho some of them were there 17 Siqueiros was there, 
the enormity of his vision 18 consumed an entire wall, 
surrounded by lesser 19 psalms to love, death, oppression and 
things raza. 20 Maria and her son Forrest greeted everyone 
with hugs 21 and smiles and told us about the 
altar. Harry Gamboa 22 was there looking erudite and lobo-lean 
in black-on-black, 23 black hair beginning to silver 24 so 
we went upstairs, joined the crowd, paid our respects 25 
sipped cold sad sodas, absorbed the mountain of bouquets 26 
photographs beads ribbons radiant blasts of pinks 27 yellows oranges 
and postcards of The Blessed Mama 28 then we returned 
to browse in the shop downstairs 29 where Toti's bowl 
seized my guts and made me buy it 30 after 
that 31 we eluded a collision on Cesar Chavez Boulevard 
32 in light traffic, swerving as an economy car nearly 
33 sideswiped us and simultaneously braking in time 34 to 
avoid plowing into six just-seen children 35 crossing the lightless 
intersection concealed 36 from view by a tore-up trailer truck 
brimmed with junk 37 minutes later, we caught breath 38 
parked on the hill west of New Sky Food 39 
and strolled for refuge, memory-to-memory 40 indulging ourselves in things 
spiced Szechuan 41 at Fu Ling's42 on the way home, 
we take Jefferson 43 stop at Harold & Belle's 44 
for some bread pudding with whiskey sauce 45 and a 
patch of peach cobbler 46 all the men are roaring 
with gab about 47 The Mike Tyson Kiss, the waitresses 
are 48 fretting about their conked kinks falling out 49 
further west, i notice the riyaki place is still open 
50 something about the horizon reminds me 51 i haven't 
visited Pop's grave in quite a while52 in Toti's bowl 
i keep things treasured 53 my seventh grade crush on 
Oscar Lopez 54 the sound of my awkward, reluctant feet 
55 shod in brown-and-white Buster Browns 56 forever leaving home 
to journey north off 88th, 57 up Avalon to 76th 
returning homeward but stopping 58 briefly, compelled by the temptation 
of 59 hamburgers fresh-grilled on 83rd 60 my stomach willing 
hostage 61 Phil Och's autograph 62 obtained during a MacArthur 
Park love-in 63 dazzle from the crystal & light entryway 
64 into Mr. DiPinto's Beverly Hills home 65 where i 
was chaperoned during 66 violin lessons in the study 67 
El Gunder's plexiglas cross 68 on rusted tin chain 69 
my children's baby teeth 70 before death met him via 
motorcycle, 71 the copper earrings Carl Gray made circa 1967 
72 in exchange for one of my lemon meringue pies 
73 Pop's clinch 74 an effusion of promises puckered and 
dried in the 75 grimness of a hot tongue & 
cold lips 76 a white-on-red 1958 Studebaker roadster 77 the 
ebony-tinged calf-skinned back seat 78 of Kelly's customized black Cadillac 
coupe 79 yellow roses 80 a black widow spider stark 
against 81 a snip of blue velvet 82 preserved in 
resin by a Chino inmate, braced 83 in a hand-crafted 
sterling silver setting 84 signed by sculptor Charles Dixon 85 
the baked potato slammed into my head by a madman 
86 not liked but longed for at sweet seventeen 87 
bumping and grinding against the future 88 to The Miracles 
crooning, "You really gotta 89 hold on ..." my first-love 
song 90 my portion of the elephant 91 the night 
two burglars broke thru 92 my boarded up consciousness 93 
to engage in rape then leave empty-hearted 94 a second 
chance 95 more of that which is too delicious 96 
in anticipation of the unrealized 97 eyes bunched up like 
grapes
