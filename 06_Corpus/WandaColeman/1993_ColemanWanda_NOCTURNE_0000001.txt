1 running in place 2 my tongue has grown strong 
and hard 3 my pace is steadier my step surer 
4 measured as circles move around me and define 5 
this frayed self the center of at least one stubborn 
6 cosmos 7 here i sweat the days 8 humming 
because rhythm makes persistence possible 9 occasionally breaking into song-and-dance 
10 aware of the weight that impedes momentum 11 aware 
of wind factor and traction 12 (to wish i were

14 as the hum of unseen fellow runners 15 urges 
me on thru this brilliant fruitless flight 16 point of 
departure is a certainty 17 arrival a myth 18 as 
i streak along the beginning turning back on 19 itself 
again and again. my focus dead ahead 20 peering. to 
see if 21 this is the dark that precedes dawn 
22 or the darkness before the dark
