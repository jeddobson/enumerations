1 rose red from across the tracks does 2 grow 
up to be a knockout. bold with big legs 3 
and all the rest of the equipment necessary 4 to 
excite a prince 5 and if she plays her pumpkins 
right (she will) 6 she'll become snow white will acquire 
7 all the material things wished upon 8 the big 
fine castle. servants of a darker race 9 the stretch 
limo. jewels and furs 10 champagne for a frivolous breakfast 
of 11 scrambled eggs and caviar 12 a smart dame 
from across the tracks, rose 13 has an instinct for 
opportunity---the savvy it 14 takes to get over. she knows 
she's got to score 15 before she's knocked up, starts 
to pudge out, or 16 otherwise loses her looks 17 
this may require compromise---dyeing her hair 18 henna or ash, 
special hormones or cosmetic surgeries 19 and pretending a certain 
amount of ignorance 20 about the workings of fairytales 21 
there will be critical moments when one word from 22 
rose would change the story's plot. but she knows 23 
her role and will hold her tongue. history 24 is 
the thorny realm of rich powerful princes 25 in the 
meantime rose can play games with trolls and 26 witches. 
her prince will tolerate it as long as 27 she 
doesn't cross him. as long as her game 28 doesn't 
interfere with his 29 and if she wants she can 
even make a sport of 30 equal height between normals 
& dwarfs. he will 31 understand. she needs to do 
something for 32 amusement---as long as the dwarfs 33 remain 
dwarfs 34 he will even allow her a wolf or 
two 35 thus our gal rose needn't concern herself 36 
with the eternal sleep threatening the kingdom 37 she is 
assured resurrection by the local 38 sorcerer who offers happy 
endings 39 at a discount
