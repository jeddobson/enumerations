chasing spiders, dust motes, and lint

has become a fulltime occupation

along with preparing meals that

will not poison what's left of our bodies

along with sweeping up after those

others who cannot sweep or do not

understand the importance of frequent

sweeping. too, i must wash the ever-dirty

socks, put out the wet bathroom mats to

dry, wipe down the refrigerator & stove,

empty myriad trash receptacles, wax and

polish what can be waxed and polished

room after room after room

i sweat elbow bend expelling rage

trapped in the desire for a neatness

i can't afford. i sweat elbow and rue

the longing that's become living

in the shit so deep

don't know if i'm wake or sleep
