1 a bouquet of promises withers in the grim 2 
at Trinity & Santa Barbara 3 the last clunker on 
the blacktop is mine 4 it's lock-up and i'm entrusted 
with the key 5 which has earned me diddly plus 
one shine for my boots 6 it's so clear. so 
desert cold. my thoughts steam up 7 the plate glass 
as i slide the grid of bars in place, 8 
maroon lips tighten to my teeth 9 lover 10 why 
aren't you home waiting? 11 lover 12 why are the 
kids left alone? 13 lover 14 why must every coin 
be endlessly tallied? 15 lover 16 when can i crawl 
into the wound and pull in the scar? 17 i'm 
slim just now. my jeans skirt is short and night 
bites 18 thru the nylon to my bones. my knuckles 
are raw from 19 washings of countertops, my fists jammed 
against the 20 linings of my empty denim pockets scrounging 
warmth, 21 clutch bag tucked firm at my armpit ( 
it's a good dawn 22 for murder ) the stomp 
of high-stacked heels dare eyes 23 imagined. i can't contain 
my laughter or my hurt 24 and they crack the 
sky above the wet neon 25 announcing 26 no arrival 
no return
