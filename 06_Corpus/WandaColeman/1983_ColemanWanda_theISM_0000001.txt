1 tired i count the ways in which it determines 
my life 2 permeates everything. it's in the air 3 
lives next door to me in stares of neighbors 4 
meets me each day in the office. its music comes 
out the radio 5 drives beside me in my car. 
strolls along with me 6 down supermarket aisles 7 it's 
on television 8 and in the streets even when my 
walk is casual/undefined 9 it's overhead flashing lights 10 i 
find it in my mouth 11 when i would speak 
of other things
