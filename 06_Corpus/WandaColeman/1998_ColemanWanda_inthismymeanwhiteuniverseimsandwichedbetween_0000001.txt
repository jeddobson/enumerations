1 in this my mean white universe i'm sandwiched between 
2 a lower-case zee and a period. my tongue plays 
tricks on me. 3 something roars. in my injurious solitude 
my legs have deserted 4 me. morning finds me under 
attack by the linen. and my 5 recalcitrant feeties will 
not get themselves out of bed. 6 the roar of 
something unseen moves toward me. i've lapsed 7 into a 
strange malaise inhabited by dispersed lives 8 and jilted grooms-of-christ. 
an anxious neurotic distorts my 9 eden with voracious snails. 
not to mention my bruised backside 10 sustained when my 
beloved Adam dropped me onto the concrete. 11 this unexpected 
& inescapable clarity breeds 12 torment. above me now, the 
demonic roar 13 of invisible bees. is it mere destiny 
to 14 be entangled and stung into stupidity?
