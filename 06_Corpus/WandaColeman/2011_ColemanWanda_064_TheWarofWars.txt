the twin plagues poverty and hate endure century upon

century upon century. hope crumbles like the twin Buddhas

of Bamiyan, or the great horns of Satan in the light of rapture

the faithful are shackled by apathy & cowardice, the brave

neutralized by shadow malignancies, and the learned cowed

by authorities who enlist religious tenets to serve oppression

our cities are sugar-combed with de facto boneyards

citizen worth taxed then interred in acid earth/the dismissed

history of slavery-based racial dislocations and lynchings.

when will the beneficiaries abandon gluttony? the corporations

empty their vaults to the needy? the converted wed amens, candles

& hymns to bone sacrifice? when will the armchair poets rise?

Johnny, your gun for whose freedom to do what to whom?

Johnny, your gun in exchange for citizenship & scholarship?

Johnny, your heart for the invalidation of your being.

where is the flag-deep apology for slavery?

where are the reparations in culture & coin?

how, then, can the mending of our nation take place?

grandstand rhetoric and flaccid protest do not a power make.

there is a never and there is a too late
