1 "the light is like this 2 in the south 
of France," he says 3 we stand on the pier 
4 watch the blond boys afloat 5 with their surfboards 
6 waiting to ride the big wave 7 "here i 
can be somebody," he says 8 a wave comes and 
two of the boys take it in 9 the boys. 
how well tanned they are 10 with skins the color 
of wet sand 11 poised unconcerned 12 in aryan uniformity 
13 "you breathe better here. the air 14 is pure. 
we can rent a house off the beach" 15 we 
listen to the roar 16 another wave. more boys take 
it in 17 my heart hangs ten , braces with 
the wet thrill 18 of foam as they splash graceful 
19 into the shallows 20 "you can find work here 
easily. me too," he says 21 i answer absently, my 
eyes on the blond boys 22 "this is a military 
town, full of rednecks 23 a tougher lily white town 
than the one i come from 24 and i don't 
swim" 25 satin slate pelicans perch atop the lamps 26 
that dot the pier. charcoal and enamel gulls dive 27 
back and forth ocean-side 28 and cream white crests of 
waves crash 29 along the most unspoiled beach i've ever 
seen 30 his eyes my eyes. his lips mine 31 
afterwards the light is brighter. we look out 32 into 
the rainbow of blues greens and aquamarines 33 watch as 
laughing swimmers return 34 "i guess you have a point," 
he says 35 we make our way silently along 36 
glistening rocks. the waves roar 37 i pick sand stones 
38 to carry home
