she liked his scenes best. he, his sephardic darkness, his 
bluesy lips she imagined were the color of pomegranates. she 
was en- thralled by his jawline. no man could wear 
a suit so magical- ly/majestically. if only she could touch 
him. if only she could let him know how she 
felt. his eyes were october sunsets. the flare to his 
nares sent thrills thru her. after months upon months of 
black-and-white viewing, shamelessly eager even for the reruns, she could 
no longer contain herself. one night, when alone before the 
television (no one else saw what she saw, of course) 
they went for a close-up. she kissed him full on 
the mouth. at that moment she became brazen. he kissed 
back.
