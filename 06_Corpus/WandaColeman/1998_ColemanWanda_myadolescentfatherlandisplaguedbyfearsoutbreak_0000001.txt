1 my adolescent fatherland is plagued by fear's outbreak 2 
pustules of public mendaciousness erupt like boils on godhead. 3 
i would medicate it---urge maturity---soothe with a balm of tears 
4 and heartbane. but i moan alone in my stinkhole, 
scribble 5 insanely the whole telling, how my mind, leveled 
again and 6 again, has been rebuilt in splendor over 
traffic-ridden squalor 7 and liquor dens. i have been touched 
by The Sacred and The Bard 8 yet fail to 
ease my melancholy soul with psalm, erasing and 9 rewriting 
and erasing until all light is extinguished in an 10 
avalanche of paper, beneath the rubble my arthritic clawings 11 
toward what? 12 the day has arrived when the blind 
beggar strays through 13 the plain of smokes, gropes among 
the dead whose pain is 14 not assuaged, makes her 
way into the crypt, takes an urn 15 to her 
lips, consumes ash for nourishment
