1 his mouth liquid this glitter night beneath stars 2 
hollywood squeezed into a dress of blue light and rain 
3 rutted asphalt 4 being rousted by car city cowboy's 
ridin' range 5 i watch, my eyes about to fall 
over zero's edge 6 panic. i'm afraid. four years of 
fear 7 taking deeper gasps for air. fighting off the 
beast 8 he's thin and crisp as a brand new 
c note 9 i've scratched that itch before. hairs stand 
up on the back of 10 my neck 11 tuesday 
midnight/pulling over to the curb---red eyed/lights 12 gone wild 13 
he flashes thirty-two and asks if i have a license 
to kill 14 all the stores closed as usual. this 
sprawling hick town 15 where prophets of false discovery carp 
over flesh of the 16 fallen 17 i step cautiously 
over discarded bones/dreams diminished to 18 level of 19 discharged 
chewing gum/semen, cig butts and smog 20 inspired sputum 21 
this jane of shades, looking to clip the neon phantom 
22 to score big---to rip ass wide open 23 home 
waits. and his arms/promise of happy demise and 24 well-worn 
mattress 25 these eyes in the sky are lights from 
stars long burnt-out 26 long gone cold
