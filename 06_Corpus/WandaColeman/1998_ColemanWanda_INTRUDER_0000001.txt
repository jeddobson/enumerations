1 i have broken and entered poetry's house. where have 
they 2 hidden the valuables? there is no safe. the 
refrigerator 3 is empty and something covered in green-gray fuzz 
4 stains my eyes and stings my nose. the oven 
door hangs 5 off its hinge. the trash of countless 
meals---eggshells, 6 coffee grounds, half-eaten fruit, old cheese---litters 7 unmopped 
floors. an inky foot-deep ring circles the basin 8 of 
the white enameled tub. the unflushed toilet is 9 feces-clogged. 
clusters of beer bottles and ashtrays erupting 10 with cigarette 
butts crowd table and counter tops. the TV 11 buzzes 
its spill of white noise. the radio persistently whines 12 
those nostalgic rhythms innocence is ever lost by. in the 
13 closet, all coat pockets and elbows are frayed. there 
is no 14 safe. in the jewel box, all the 
diamonds, rubies and pearls 15 prove paste. i've broken into 
poetry's house. it smells 16 unclean/unholy. and there is nothing 
here worthy of theft
