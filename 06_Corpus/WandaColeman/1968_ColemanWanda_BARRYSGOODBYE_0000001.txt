1 i don't know the man. he lies on top 
of me 2 his fingers explore my wet avenue---every crack 
3 in the brick (watch that mother's back!) 4 this 
stranger bruises my ebony silk with his 5 o'clock stubble 
5 no i will not testify on his behalf 6 
last year's blood caked under my fingernails and 7 bits 
of flesh. this itch don't quit 8 i lie to 
him. i don't want him anymore and wish he'd 9 
go poof! but can't stand to slay him 10 (he's 
so sweet curled up in my crotch) 11 but i'm 
starved for that mythical hard-on and it is a myth 
12 my hands are cramped/tired/have failed to jerk him into 
13 a salute. he's one of those ---60s damage 14 
it's the same old grunt struggle the same old pain 
unsaid 15 the same old stinky disappointment 16 he uses 
his finger but it ain't the same/is lame 17 as 
i 18 sink my nails into his fleshy alabaster back. 
he don't even 19 feel the bite. looks glumly into 
my hunger 20 "how come you don't move them thighs 
like you used to?"
