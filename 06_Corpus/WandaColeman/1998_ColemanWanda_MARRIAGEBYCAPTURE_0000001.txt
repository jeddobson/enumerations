1 jackrabbit fever: he wants to fuck, she wants to 
discuss 2 her need/love, the overlap yet difference. 3 their 
unfinished works remain at issue. 4 on her dog-eared ledger 
of emotions 5 everything is out of balance, 6 the 
debit column a slur of crimson ink 7 "but i 
gave you the moon," he whispers. 8 "i appreciate that," 
she says. "but the tides 9 are eroding the beach, 
the gulls are drowning 10 and the shore is coming 
apart." 11 he listens to her spin & buzz 12 
his hand rises to his philosopher's forehead 13 his anxious 
palm cups his thick devilish brows 14 his chest shudders 
to a rise then falls 15 the moist edges of 
his eyes 16 give perspective. shades of blue add resonance 
17 to her laughter 18 "when people look at us, 
they know we fuck a lot." 19 "yes. we're such 
obvious animals," she intones 20 "a compliment, considering our ages." 
21 frequently, she talks and riles at him 22 in 
her head, then is startled by his voice 23 "were 
you calling me?" he asks. 24 "no, i wasn't," she 
lies. 25 the car is acting ugly 26 and she's 
worried something might happen 27 to clip their purse for 
the hundredth time. when 28 she hears him ease the 
car into the driveway, 29 she kisses the wind 30 
and rushes for the door, stops herself 31 and turns 
it off 32 frequently, while she visualizes a solution, 33 
she's snapped back into their moment 34 by the unexpected 
warmth of his hand 35 different skins same lusts. boundaries 
emerge as 36 they fall silent. 37 "we're starting to 
look alike," he jokes, "you're 38 growing a beard and 
i'm growing tits." 39 things deteriorate as they read, pun 
and grope. 40 tongue-and-finger music makes it easier to navigate 
41 (in the dimness she turns her eyes that way, 
42 to observe again, the creature who lives on the 
wall, 43 its risings and writhings against the invisible) 44 
the deeper he goes the darker she becomes 45 "when 
i opened my mouth this morning," he smiles 46 "all 
the women fainted."
