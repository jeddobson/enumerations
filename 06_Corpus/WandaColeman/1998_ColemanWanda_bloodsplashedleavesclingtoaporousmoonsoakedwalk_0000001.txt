1 blood-splashed leaves cling to a porous moon-soaked walk 2 
suggest failed escape and ebbing consciousness 3 emotion---gorged, a trail 
pocked by steel casings, confused 4 by the scuffle of 
inquisitive sneakers and killer shoes--- 5 angellight---and in its beam 
the winged intruder descends 6 crimeward, sinking into a night 
of blades and blackened eyes. 7 trees genuflect in the 
wind, witness swift midnight shushings, 8 the crude wrench of 
psyche from soma, shelter newborn ghosts. 9 after a breakfast 
of headlines, runners jog the neighborhood, 10 circle the event 
marked off by yellow tape and moody uniforms. 11 sightseeing 
arouses gratitude---some disquiet in 12 close whispers, prayers from the 
fearful lucky---deep 13 in shock---inured souls like blight unsettling the 
city 14 once industry fails and a mean prosperity hurries 
south
