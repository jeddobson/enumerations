1 brushing up against his bearded cheek 2 hope nursed 
on fear genocide at random 3 winging against desert wind 
the making of exaggerated 4 spirals cold promise of how 
to live evermore yet 5 never be old followed by 
sudden flittings off 6 returnings dippings circlings wings winging 7 
downward now up up against the ultraviolet 8 another star 
close enough to cup in the palms 9 noiseless glistening 
in the cruel brilliance my 10 turbid thoughts flutter toward 
his luminescence 11 blind. utterly 12 flies into him/fries
