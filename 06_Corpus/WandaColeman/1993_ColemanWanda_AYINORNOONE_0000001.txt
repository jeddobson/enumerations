wind or voice of god? the well-traveled road out of 
eden turns upon itself oases layers of elaborate multicolored sheets 
the way flesh dampens and gives burst to salt in 
excessive heats dilated eyes roll up and inward to whiten 
to circumscribe their own final shutter- ings windows boarded up 
nailed against intrusive harsh abusive sun against dust from unpaved 
roads snaking unwinding across three thousand miles of concrete majesty 
and fifty-odd years of thrashings up the amazon of the 
soul to her narrow darkened pathway jungled-down and threatening where 
she waits breathing deeply air of hunger vamp-shaman jihad-monger mother-of-the-city 
maker-of-roads her emotive tar sticky in the siroccan blaze captures 
the imprint of his eagerness his steps this traveler (fleeing 
holocaust) he's come in exploration/hadj the metropolis this ageless romance 
a shanker a miracle cause for shame cause for glory 
such fevers such contraindications/ neuroses "is the glass half full 
or half empty?" he asked. "it depends on how thirsty 
i am," she answered. the road ever onward the traveler 
naked and blind (nakedly blind) in lust an elongation that 
stiffens with satori drums drum- ming intensifies the act an 
unwinding turning in into her pomegranate eyes her raven mouth 
the cave of the giver crypt of the taker her 
holy hole thru which he simooms pain endur- ing forced 
labor the by-product of their night's cabal the child- stuff 
suctioned from her womb into a necrotic blackness ever stillborn 
harmony the abortion/disembowelment of song frustrated/choked by the twisted umbilicus 
of hate his hardness the stubborn thrusts which storm her 
eyes flood her backwater dirt roads to spiritual el dorados 
the greedy claw of anger maul- ing her slave's heart 
as abusive as that urban sun endless poverty her eyes 
closed in wonder/submission to his davening the savour of his 
red sweat stinging her bluesy lips his hazel eyes relentless 
harmattans (he mounts he enters he descends) as on sheets 
twisted back on butt-weary mattresses stinking of generations of excessive 
demands tongue and again tongue their frictions one traveling flesh 
of the other over and over this ritual coitus/ rendering 
of delirium
