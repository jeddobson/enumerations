to rip me off for whatever he could find 3

the ladder 5 i couldn't get at him thru the 
chicken wire fence 6 ran to cut him off on 
the other side of the house 7 he break-necked across 
the street zig-zagging 8 thru the campus parking lot 9 
me hot in the track of his dirty sneakers 10 
he darted into the bungalows and i lost him 11 
dizzy with disgust and the chase 12 i turned back 
to cross the street 13 my neighbors were at their 
doors and windows 14 making with applause
