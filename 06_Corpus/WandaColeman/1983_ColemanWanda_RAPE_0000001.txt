1 i am here to help you 2 he laughed. 
and his partner laughed. she squeezed 3 her palms/triggers. their 
uniforms bled 4 the laughter became screams of horror and 
she 5 dragged the bodies of the white blond cop 
and 6 his chinese bunky down stairs 7 and buried 
them in her eyes/hatred 8 sprang up and blossomed 9 
talk about it 10 tell me every detail, said the 
doctor 11 they broke in on me. every detail. they 
took me 12 in the bedroom, one at a time. 
next detail 13 i was scared they'd find my purse---i 
lied about 14 having no money. detail, detail. they undressed 
me, 15 asked me to tell them how it felt. 
did it feel 16 good? yes. did you cum? they 
were gentle lovers 17 did you cum? yes. both times? 
yes 18 the boyfriend 19 came in. she was feeling 
shrunken dirty suicide 20 she hadn't douched. the wetness still 
pouring 21 out/a sticky riverlet on her inner thighs 22 
he got indignant. why didn't she call the police 23 
why didn't she call her mama. why didn't she die 
24 fighting. she remained silent. he asked her where 25 
it happened. she showed him the spot. he 26 pulled 
down his pants, forced her back onto the sheets 27 
i haven't cleaned up, she whined. but he was 28 
full saddle hard dicking and cumming torrents 29 the two 
burglars 30 kicked the door in. she woke. she thought, 
he's 31 drunk again. she slipped into her thin pink 
32 gown, got up and went to see. it wasn't 
him. we 33 have guns, the dark one announced 34 
there's no one here but me and the kids she 
said 35 there was little 36 for them to steal. 
the dark one took her into 37 the bedroom while 
his partner searched. he turned 38 out the lights and 
stripped. he laid her gently on 39 the bed. this 
is my name. when you cum, call 40 my name. 
she agreed. and he entered. your pussy's 41 hot and 
tight. where's your old man? he's 42 a fool not 
to be here with you. you're pretty 43 you're soft. 
you fuck good. kiss me. and she did 44 as 
told. we don't want to hurt you. you like 45 
the way i kiss. tell the truth. it's good, 46 
she said and after a while she moaned his name 
47 the other one 48 came in and took off 
his clothes in the dark 49 i'm really sorry to 
do this, he said, but 50 i can't help myself. 
strange, she thought. such 51 polite rapists. i wonder if 
they'll kill me 52 somehow i must make them care 
enough not 53 to kill me. he told her his 
name and sucked 54 hungry at her nipples, parted her 
legs 55 he was very thick long hard. his friend's 
seed 56 eased the pain. i want your tongue he 
said 57 give me your tongue. she gave and gave 
58 jesus! he cried and shot into her, long spastic 
jerks 59 he trembled and fell into her arms. shit 
60 that was good 61 in the kitchen 62 her 
few valuables were piled neatly mid-floor 63 she promised not 
to call the police 64 what could they do, save 
her? 65 the other one, the jesus-man took her typewriter 
66 and put it back, and all the other stuff 
they 67 had planned to take. even the television 68 
here is my number, said the dark one 69 when 
you get lonely, call 70 and she walked 71 them 
to the door. the dark one took her in his 
arms 72 kissed her goodbye 73 she waited 74 until 
she was sure they wouldn't 75 come back and kill 
76 she picked up the phone 77 and made the 
mistake of thinking the world 78 would understand
