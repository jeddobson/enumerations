there in the wind, fast food, java & exhaust

and my feet—they burn beneath the leather

call what i do a lope, a stagger, a trudge

i'm moving with the stiff-legged stomp

of a peg-legged atlas

of an iron-toed monster chased by shadows

no matter that i'm female. i'm approaching that age

where women are sexless to all save lovers

where cancer and the fear of cancer governs talk

where the shape of bones, the workings of organs

and the aches of responsibility dictate choices

jes' ain't effin' funnn

there in the wind, the foreign sweat of youths

and my heart—it thumps in my ears

as i slog through my past, toward the elevator

time has become ungraspable. others move

past me as i stand still. the nights skip along

without my having lived them. i wake from

a daze, driven breathless by nocturnal blooms

there on the wind, thoughts of my lover

whom i've left without leaving. he warms our

bed in another city … that urban pacific dystopia

of depression disillusion disembowelment

there on the wind, a desert's chill draws the

heat from my skin—it is pocked and blue-bruised

call what i do a lope, a stagger, a trudge

i'm moving, if slowly, upward—cloud by cloud

and my feet—they burn beneath the leather

where on the wind, the smells of war and dogs
