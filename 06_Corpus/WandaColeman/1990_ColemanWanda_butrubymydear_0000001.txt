1 he hikes those narrow chords one more time 2 
to a dingy walkup on the outskirts of ecstasy 3 
he knows every note of her 4 down to that 
maddening musky treble 5 from between her dusky thighs 6 
even as he raps twice to let her know 7 
he means business 8 and hears her singeful "who's there?" 
9 as she unlocks the double bass count 10 he's 
gonna put hurt on her 11 he's gonna love her 
like winter loves snow 12 he's gonna make her 13 
beyond that scratchy 78 whining dreary days and 14 whiskey 
nights 15 beyond that too sweet smoky andante 16 beyond 
that hunger for impossible freedom 17 to the heart of 
melody 18 where they will go to steam 19 in 
the jazzified mystical sanctity 20 of discordant fusion 21 scaling
