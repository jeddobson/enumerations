1 six stories of sweat, swill and decaying stucco 2 
they meet outside the black wrought-iron gate 3 the lobby 
is bare except for gaudy red corduroy drapes 4 and 
an ancient white couple whispering 5 on the blood red 
divan 6 he walks her up. reggae & laughter from 
402 7 smoke signals. tough & tearless (may the ancestors 
8 watch over her) so what else can be done 
to her 9 done in done dirty---well done 10 nothing 
left to call pleasure but the giving of it 11 
when the only difference between queen & whore is tone 
of voice 12 maybe he's rich. maybe he's THE ONE 
13 he's left the Chi-Town Hawk for Lady Illusion 14 
chose greatness over the money-fame game 15 (tells it so's 
it's known even he can't buy the lie) 16 failure 
scrawled everywhere, on his dirty white shirt 17 the dirty 
white walls, across the dirty white pages of his play 
18 he smells of depilatory and after shave 19 half 
white half black half man half woman 20 as ambivalent 
as April 21 bemoans/groans---his last twenty grand chomped up by 
22 hollywood werewolves---the ace of spades at forty with nothing 
23 but 24 ache and i'm gonna 25 and culture 
disintegrates into spit for lubrication 26 a dicking so brutal 
it scares 27 then his partner shows up unexpectedly and 
lingers 28 she smells the set-up 29 fiji snack: liver 
sauted in beer with onion 30 pita bread & hot 
sauce after ganja 31 it's a long bare escape down 
the maroon elevator 32 to the dyspneic lobby. the halls 
stink of 33 somebody's shit. the walls are tight/phobic 34 
the night air as sullen as her heart 35 when 
the only difference between queen & whore 36 is bone 
of choice
