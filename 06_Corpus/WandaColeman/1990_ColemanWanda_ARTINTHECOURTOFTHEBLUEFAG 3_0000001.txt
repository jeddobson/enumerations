1 the whine: 2 bepalmed avenue. long walk, trying to 
avoid the burger 3 shack where puberty makes itself felt 
between the leaves. 4 crying over the fictional death of 
the last man on mars 5 very long and straight 
it waved, darted to break her open, 6 slip between 
the tight/fear of discovery 7 if i didn't know he 
was someone else i'd swear he was someone else 8 
the call: 9 broadway at high noon. nimbus, bus stop 
and awaiting a 10 ride home. it is the summer 
of breaded fried shrimp and 11 zen beneath the covers 
at night 12 so mom & pop won't see 13 
the blood, a light trickle. she was afraid to tell 
him, so he 14 never knew for sure if she 
was virgin 15 (at $500 a deflowering, he buys them 
for his boyfriend, 16 watches and masturbates) 17 and when 
he turned full profile, the pain subsided/journey resumed 18 i 
am safe
