1 at seventeen, Daddy hitched into town two 2 jumps 
ahead of a noose as the century slumped 3 into 
its thirties. liberated since the age of eight, 4 his 
greatest gifts were rhythmic hands, stalwart 5 eyes and major 
league lungs---quick to get any 6 likeness on paper, able 
to hunt and kill 7 with a rock aimed dead-on, 
a Robeson vibrato. 8 no sooner had he set boots, 
than the earth quaked 9 loose sending plate glass and 
prayers flying. 10 in short time he was making his 
hustle whatever 11 he could catch, from running errands to 
pyramiding 12 the collections skim. he would come to love 
13 the ropes inside the ring and out. befriended 14 
by The King of Gypsies, he learned to shadow 15 
the pre-war harbor ever wishful for his ship to dock, 
16 to graduate from apple tams to fedoras, from 17 
denim coveralls to pin-striped suits and wing-tips
