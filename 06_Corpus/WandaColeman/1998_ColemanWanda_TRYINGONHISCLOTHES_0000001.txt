tucked in jacket breast pockets. 4 once we giggled past

and ungainly to even 6 attempt. we could brace against 
the trunk and spread 7 our arms into his coats 
while they remained on 8 the hanger and we'd dangle 
there thrillingly like 9 Christmas tree ornaments from a flocked 
branch. on the top 10 shelf he kept his silver-tipped 
cane, high-hat, pork-pie 11 and beaver brims. even an unadorned 
drab olive Army 12 hat. the worn brown felt fedoras 
hung from hooks 13 inside the closet door. from a 
wall bracket snaked belts 14 of polished leather, rawhide and 
suede. sloshing around in 15 his wing-tips, silk ties straggling 
from our necks, 16 arms and hands swallowed in starched 
sleeves, we'd 17 lower our squeaks and reach for his 
majesty
