1 down to the stingy stringy marrow of my mojo 
rant 2 there's something in race matters that's atwitch 3 
i loathe the bitchlook, austere immaculate 4 of deathscapes drawn 
in pastels and pearly monotones 5 there's something my lusty 
afrogenius bemoans 6 barren holes and cold silver on a 
sky concrete 7 a thread of sputum, churned to murky 
spate 8 streaming thru slanted gutters culled from stone 9 
i loathe indifferent flags, the blue and the gray 10 
a nation's shelves ill-stocked rendering meager feed 11 reparation briefer 
eden than the apple-eater's breath 12 sullenness, the red-winged descends, 
alights to stay 13 swift vengefulness like fire to the 
reeds 14 inflames my vigilant soul denies it rest
