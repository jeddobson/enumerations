not a spice—but a shifting, strangely sans color

a blue sky giving nothing back, not shape not form

either to cumuli or tangibles

borne from a long stare,

that cool pause that could signal change

my eyes are ghetto brown

reflect those mean streets and cruel alleyways

gives back cul-de-sacs where shadows bleed

uselessly. i am trapped here between the

siren and the silliness that saps my vitality

sea changes ahead

how many days to translate look into act?

talking reveals diddly, doing a circular dance

i have lifted myself into a world of white collar

professionals. yet what distinguishes me does not

seem to exist. there are dangers—but no edges to

warn of impending failure. no hidden trail,

opening onto salvation

not that i am not looking. my eyes are glued to the

sky—for signs for evidence for the north star.
