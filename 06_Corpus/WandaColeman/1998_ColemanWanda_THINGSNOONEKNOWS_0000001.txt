1 overcome by the stink of mildewed wash, i have 
2 been three months behind in my rent for thirty 
years. my 3 countrymen do not love me. even my 
lines have 4 lines. we are getting old in a 
city where the old are 5 invisible. i have nothing 
new to eat and barely five minutes 6 to use 
the jane. and less time than that to revisit my 
7 father's grave. i've worn the same underwear for fifteen 
8 of those thirty years and some pieces longer than 
that 9 writing friends is a luxury, enemies a necessity. 
my car 10 was stripped and stolen months ago and 
i have no 11 money with which to repair or 
replace it. my mentors have 12 exiled me to the 
outskirts of nappy literacy. my wallet is 13 dying of 
militant brain cancer. my lust for my country 14 is 
frigid. the light excludes me and there is 15 no 
degree for what is learned in the dark 16 i 
am too clumsy to steal big. there is a boogieman 
in 17 New York City who conspires against and spreads 
18 rumors about my lost lip. i am so economically 
crippled 19 even my begging cup has mold sprouting in 
its well. my 20 son has mistaken me for a 
dragon and his history teachers keep 21 trying to hose 
out these flames in my mouth. i do not 22 
attend my high school class reunions because too many of 
23 my classmates died in Vietnam or in the liquor 
lockers 24 of America or in those classrooms long ago. 
there is 25 a boogiewoman in Oberlin who conspires against 
me, her 26 jealousy inspired by my imaginary imaginings 27 
i am trapped in the hold of my greedy grief 
28 and expect to keep circling. i expect my son 
to escape 29 and my husband to die during exquisite 
crisis. the federal 30 bureau of pajamas is after my 
hot cross buns. i expect to 31 awaken from sleep 
soon. i expect my banana nut bread to 32 go 
stale and uneaten. i expect to die poemless and to 
be 33 cremated in state ovens. i expect my ashes 
34 to be scattered like pollen, to take wing on 
the wind 35 like buddhaflies
