1 white tequila white moon white lies 2 wyoming love 
symphony yellowstone afire there's 3 nothing there but there wyoming 
wampum our national 4 treasure the whole damned state is 
pure park nothing 5 in wyoming but K-Mart. way out 
west in the wondrous wilds 6 of wyoming (i love 
toby. you mean my husband? no, your 7 dad) beautiful 
beauteous wyoming of the waltzing with bear 8 and jackrabbit 
run lifers wyoming lotta beer tribesmen 9 stuck on reservations 
doomed to sundance on the purple 10 wyoming sage forever 
where all the rusted-out chassis go 11 to die wyoming 
big blue sky death/dead of quiet peopled 12 by renegade 
spirits glass entombed arrowheads where once 13 was the Shoshone 
the big whiteness of New Spain and 14 sun-weathered leathery 
wyoming hide and shall we gather 15 at the big 
wind river and boil it all down to glory
