To the north the interstate is lined with eucalypti

To the south, gorgon-headed raffia.

Our pigeons and starlings nest loudly and wildly,

their droppings taking the paint off abandoned chassis.

Seduced by sun, we strip to our skivvies and dash beachside

for café lattes in Venice, sipped slowly until cooled by the time

we storm Santa Monica, suggesting a carelessness that

turns into laughter once it reaches our eyes. We

are the bad children, playing hooky while Mom & Dad

are skyscraper bound and permanently pressed.

One sudden turn of a corner and we are grown-ups ourselves

pushing our truths around like baby carriages.

The clowns who keep these tropical

gates are our topic of discussion—caught red-handed

in the sangria, scarfing on an appropriated fame.

Dad'll understand, he wrote their background, before

they lived it. Dad'll understand in the way they understand

border patrols, police sirens, K-9, and SWAT teams—the way they

understand living on the principal while someone less

fortunate pays 30 years of interest. Dad'll give ’em ten seconds

to repent retreat and resign themselves to Fate. Dad

knows because he's the ugly blister under their skins.

So Mom explains why, for a while, the cost of

gratitude and indebtedness, the amount of time it

takes to break through, when lucky enough

to get a break, with or without the coffee. The backdoor

bookie takes all bets, the gambler only worth the physics

of a random draw. It's what comes with one's birth

owner or owned. What matters is that they are out there

listening, the same words repeated ad infinitum

packaged, marketed, sold. Commerce is the way of

our universe. Buck it, might as well buck breathing.

Fury only serves to make the desperate more crazy

because there is no escape from paying unless

you're one of the makers of muck or you're shaken

off the planet and into the void like a flea off a pelt.
