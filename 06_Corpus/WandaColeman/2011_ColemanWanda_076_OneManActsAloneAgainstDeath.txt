he sits on his pencils

contemplating time

snickering at all those who

can't begin to imagine death. if they

knew him, they'd be jealous.

the clock in his ears tocks

loudly minute-by-minute

repeatedly redefining time

how every moment equals

one life wasted, one life exalted

seconds divided by acute awareness

produces a profusion of outcomes

on those ear-rending occasions

when his ears sink to his chest

he is beset by the birth of

new planets.

he wouldn't stop eternity if he could

yet, surreptitiously, he resets the clock

backward for as many hours needed

knowing he's not fooling any god

worthy of the title. but a little stalling

is sometimes a beautiful thing.
