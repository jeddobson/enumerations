here we sit at the ceremonious table of your grief

and say grace

hearts bowed, heads heavy, hands at poise

every meal he has ever prepared appears in your eyes

and is proudly served before us on warm Doctor Bird platters

in tasty conch-shaped baskets

and in overflowing tureens. we sample each romance

appetizers to desserts—origins in ackee okra tamarind

the wine of tears anoints, burns our throats then soothes

it was said: “This time God sent the Cook as well as the Meat.”

amens are uttered and

the ink of recipes becomes the blood of a life gourmet

drunk on aromas & the music of marímbulas

we dine sumptuously we dine with abandon

we eat and sing and sing and eat

more are the stained napkins and bibs hanging about us

as if heaven's robes—as we fatten in the gaiety

of praise and pot liquor

believe or disbelieve—it matters not. the one who creates

is undeniably the embodiment

love is God
