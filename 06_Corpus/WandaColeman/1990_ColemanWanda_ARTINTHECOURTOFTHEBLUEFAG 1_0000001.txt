1 twinight earth my flesh quakes 2 song of long 
hours laying blues on the counter 3 reminder, a friend 
girl who tried suicide. i saved her life 4 she 
repaid me by going with my main man 5 reds. 
a pin. three holes. hot water 6 down. thigh. moon 
vomiting blood 7 i notch each failure with a burn. 
the eyes of tucson-radio's 8 lisp or hollywood's houndstooth jacket 
in nether world of 9 juke and jive, a blossom---a 
chocolate poppy smoked 10 black onto a needle's tip 11 
he's traveled all around the world in the mouth of 
a whore, 12 clasps my hand, sighs haiti, praises papa 
doc. rich, he 13 owns several souls other than 14 
blues. ink. three hos. cold water 15 up. sigh. into 
sun snorting snot 16 she set the house afire and 
passed out cold on the mattress 17 high school disco 
desire sixteen and not a single dream 18 on the 
boulevard i watch the blind tap out courage 19 behind 
my shades i too am numbed by neon and am 
20 hustling ass for that pimp, success 21 the blue 
fag looks out over sunset. smiles 22 traffic for miles
