1 the black would-be poet told me a story 2 
about his cup in the middle of a forest of 
cups 3 and how there was a golden cup 4 
it was the cup 5 and how he had found 
it 6 and had known that it was not brass 
7 as were the others 8 and i knew he 
spoke of another woman 9 the woman who was half-black 
and half-ceylonese 10 who wove spices and spells into tapestries 
of love 11 she was his gold flesh beauty with 
hip-length silken brown 12 hair. he told me about her 
as he talked, reached for my 13 thigh, kneaded my 
soft darkness and told me i was a 14 bronze 
cup in his forest of cups 15 and cupped my 
breasts and 16 his hands worked the bronze, fired it 
17 found it strong yet yielding 18 he told me 
gold was much better 19 but he had lost her 
20 had abused/misused and she had been taken by another 
21 man and so he was content to have bronze 
22 to fill the cup with cum
