1 i imagine him the still unknown, my teen first 
love 2 of another race 3 i meet my green 
boy on a blue avenue. 4 my kiss returns me 
to me in his blue eyes 5 he teaches me 
the dance of the planets, 6 barefoot and toe-deep in 
the ash of craters. 7 as we move to the 
song of celestial harmony, 8 jealous winds rise and rip 
at my sleep. 9 the rings of Saturn descend like 
nooses. 10 Mars rolls fiery across the blooded sky. on 
11 the horizon, Venus swoons. mothership descends 12 and beams 
of lightning command him to return. alone. 13 life is 
desolate after lift-off. i imagine his 14 eyes---those laughing cool 
probes---searching back 15 across time and rainbows for 16 some 
trace of our moment. here, i remain, 17 having taken 
root to twist toward the 18 horizon, nourished by a 
strange resilient glow. 19 no green boy can survive in 
my world of stormy white swirls
