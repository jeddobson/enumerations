and i used to pal around a lot. we'd go 
and do and run. it was fun in a way. 
i mean, i liked betty. she was a-okay. i called 
her blind betty cause she always pretended she couldn't see 
me when i knew that she could. i was fascinated 
wondering why someone who couldn't stand to look at me 
always hung out with me, always called me on the 
phone to talk to me for hours at a time 
(one time eight hours straight. a listening record for me). 
perhaps it was 'cause i looked so much like her 
after the very first glance she felt i no longer 
bore examination---it isn't necessary to continually stare at one's mirror 
image. one begins to think strange thoughts. blind betty and 
i were both black, almost the same skin tone except 
that hers ran to yellow and mine ran to red. 
blind betty wasn't as tall as i, physically, but her 
ego made up for every inch and she was active 
aggressive while i was passive aggressive, so it seemed to 
work out. in that way, blind betty and i were 
fast friends. it was cool until one day something bad 
happened to me. i got sick and i did not 
feel like suffering through blind betty's interminable monologs anymore. when 
i was forced to travel miles to work so i 
could pay my doctor bills i tried to tell blind 
betty. but she pretended she did not hear/see my mouth 
shape the syllables. i shaped them very carefully. i even 
wrote them down in a book and gave them to 
her to read. but blind betty couldn't see the pages, 
being blind. so one day, when me and blind betty 
went to breakfast with her gentleman friend, i took off 
my blouse and bra. blind betty saw me. she let 
me know in no uncertain terms that she saw me. 
she didn't like what she saw. her gentleman friend proffered 
no opinion. i drove blind betty and her man home. 
i've been free and seen ever since.
