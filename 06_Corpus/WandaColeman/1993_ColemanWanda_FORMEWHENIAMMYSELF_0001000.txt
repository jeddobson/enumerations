as have all the others. i 147 can't bring myself 
to send them. i should never write when 148 angry 
or depressed. my words seem to overwhelm 149 whomever 150 
i write to at the time. i need to write 
it, so i do, and 151 tear it up afterwards 
and go on about my usual struggle 152 as best 
i can. writing an exorcism blah blah blah. i imagine 
153 my letter read. and even though it isn't, i 
feel better 154 having written, as though it were read 
and 155 understood. going thru the process 156 i'm not 
good at explaining how i 157 feel. i have 158 
run out of synonyms for rage 159 there are preconceived 
notions in which i feel trapped 160 i keep thinking 
my work will liberate me from them 161 it hasn't 
162 as though life's language is its own snare 163 
so by not sending 164 these letters i escape entrapment 
165 you dig? 166 ever so sincerely--- 167 regionality = 
living room 168 i am, at last, content to leave 
169 the place i've never been 170 knowing i will 
never get there 171 gonna kick off my blues 172 
hostile love 173 he shuffles the deck expertly. he offers 
a cut 174 as if i had a choice. i 
pass. what difference 175 can i make? the sonofabitch has 
memorized the position 176 of every bloody card. i play 
the game, my heart jittering, 177 fiercely stubborn against my 
calculated loss (karma? please ) 178 he smiles as he 
goes down "the winner" 179 then coos, "congratulate me" 180 
then tempts me to murder, his mouth twisted in 181 
you act so niggerish. there i go there i go 
there 182 i go smashing things glasses shattered wine spilled 
plates 183 dashed to the restaurant floor. i rush out 
into the tony 184 night to walk it off. waves 
of crises (for the worse) as his 185 eyes follow 
with U-boat acuity 186 how can he disrespect the millions 
187 whose dying gave us ourselves 188 no forgetting no 
forgiving 189 (cooling out my crazed and exploded flesh) 190 
i go for a reading. the gypsy is tipsy 191 
tells me she needn't fear work. she got enuff moolah 
192 to coast five years and there's always her mama's 
mansion 193 in the right white part of town. as 
for my future? i 194 shouldn't bank on it 195 
not forgotten not forgiven 196 the dark heart slum effluent 
197 emetic for the bile of spirit 198 the dark 
heart broken, spreading 199 plague. a need-fever (springing from the 
cavity 200 of greed. the seat of the great gold-toothed 
mouth 201 yawning---its own void/emptiness) 202 the gotten the given 
203 an eeling pain sharp then diffuse 204 thru gristle 
then meat 205 corkscrewing 206 the dark heart/earth casts up 
its dead 207 breathes 208 the exalted spasm 209 pearl 
to his tongue 210 he imprisons/keeps me in its pleasure 
211 throbs moving thru me 212 his eyes tasting for 
my sweetening signaling 213 tabes dorsalis /meltdown 214 memory: paper 
warped by the humidity of 215 pressed flesh 216 forgiven 
not forgotten 217 we rain in each other/darkness parts 218 
sighing smiling he withdraws from me night after 219 year 
after 220 grabbing tissues to catch our excessive moistures 221 
then 222 he sits at my side, at the edge 
of our 223 storm-wrecked bed 224 i watch him watch 
me 225 (the better) in hazy after-sex 226 one maverick 
wisp of hair dangles free at his 227 sweaty brow, 
his head tilted slightly 228 eyes stroking mine in luminous 
night 229 as i 230 grope thru my surrender 231 
for some bit of juju 232 to hold us here, 
now 233 just like this
