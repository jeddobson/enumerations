my eyes are as big and as Grimm as china saucers

but this is no fairytale. i do my daily doings

hurried to purposeful distraction, a couple of snits or fits

if thangs work out—anything to keep my muddling mind

off those kith among those missing

if i'm lucky the headlines will be so outrageous

i will spend my attention on indignation and spin

my misery into the appropriate rhetoric of one once

so well aware. “blast those broken-winged so-and-sos … .”

i'll smoke. and all of that. avoiding the image of him

his smile wavers in the corners of molting mirrors, lives

in the blinky eyes of alley cats, collects in the somber dregs

of wine bottles, smiles up at me in the faint resemblance

of another's child in a yellowing photo, one he never saw,

echoes in the open laughter of his sister, appears in my

muted squint at a movie scene, one of his favorites—images

of him uncoiling in the pressed rose of his hair

swimming. i imagine him swimming. amusing onlookers

with splashes. a mock drowning. then seaside and imperial

the long-limbed man-child with palms to his knees

enjoying a summer's bask shoreside, drawing signs and

symbols with elongated fingers the color of wet sand

swimming. i imagine his return to the waters. heavily lifting those

arms too long, against the waves, like an awkward teenager

like a mother reaching back
