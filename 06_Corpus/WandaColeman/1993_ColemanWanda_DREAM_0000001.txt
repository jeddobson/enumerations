1 i wake to the report of hard-running water. my 
2 view of the bathroom door is framed in muted 
yellow 3 light. i shake my somnambulant lover and hiss 
4 someone is in the head. 5 he throws the 
covers askew and i rise to follow 6 his cautious 
moves my one arm fearfully at his shoulder 7 the 
other at his waist. i tremble in the coolness 8 
clad only in dread and a thin lavender gown. 9 
abruptly the bathroom door opens inward. my father 10 briefly 
frowns out at us. his face masked in gray 11 
we step in after him and awkwardly crowd the doorway 
12 naked and mighty my father is a young man 
again, buff 13 and sleek the way i knew him 
as a child. his stream 14 of urine is forceful 
and the roar of Niagara rises 15 from the toilet 
bowl. my lover smiles, unconcerned. 16 "it's only Pop, sweetie, 
taking a piss!" 17 "but Pop's dead!" i shriek, grabbing 
him around his 18 neck, throwing my full weight against 
his. we 19 tumble back from the door causing it 
to swing partly 20 shut. a skeletal hand appears at 
the base of the 21 door. it beckons then vanishes. 
my father frowns out 22 at us again and i 
go into a shout and frantically 23 scoot backwards clutching 
my unmindful lover in 24 my arms, shouting to regain 
consciousness, shouting/ 25 into a banshee/to banish this night haint. 
luckily 26 i manage to reawaken into this present dream 
27 alone and still shouting
