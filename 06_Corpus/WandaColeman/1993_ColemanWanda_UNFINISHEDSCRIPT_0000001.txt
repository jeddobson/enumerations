A woman's scream is heard followed by a series of 
moans. Fade in is also the turning on of a 
lamp which sits on the bed- stand in the bedroom 
of elderly Mr. & Mrs. Elmore Ashworth. It has been 
turned on by the anxious Dora as she rigidly sits 
listening to the alternating cascade of half-cries and whimpers as 
they penetrate the bedroom wall. She turns to her soundly 
sleeping husband and shakes him. 3 Elmore! Elmore! He's beating 
her again! 4 Do something! Elmore groans and turns over. 
6 Mind your own business, Dora! He turns his back 
to her, burying his wispy-haired head in the pillows. She 
lifts the phone from its cradle and aggressively punches the 
touch-tone tabs. 8 I'm calling the police! CUT TO Exterior 
corridor of the adjoining apartment. Angle on the door as 
two black-clad uniformed officers approach, combat-ready. Officer A takes up 
position on the right, Officer B on the left. Officer 
B readies his club then uses it, banging loudly against 
the hardwood door. 11 Open it up in there. Police! 
After a beat the door swings open. A tall, very 
hairy, very well- muscled Jewish male in his late 40s 
stands defiantly butt-naked in the entrance. The two officers exchange 
a look. Officer B clears his throat officiously. 13 We 
got a domestic violence complaint, 14 mister. Neighbors say you're 
beating 15 your wife. The man smiles, defiant and sarcastic. 
17 That's right. So arrest me already. 18 I'm beating 
her with this. He shows off his still-erect, grossly over-large 
circumcised penis as the officers vacillate between annoyance, disgust, amusement 
and laughter.
