1 The work such woman does in the world works 
on her ... her movements her perceptions her loves. Life 
is intolerable in a society that does not value/want her 
gift; especial- ly when it does not want the vision 
she must espouse in the act of putting herself in 
the world thru art. What does Sapphire envision? Her innate 
loveliness of which she may be defensive or insecure. But 
if she seeds her self-doubt in a nurturing self- love 
she may harvest the rapture of creation. Otherwise she may 
fill herself with hate, but will her skin contain it? 
Hate blurs. Certainly she cannot create when her vision is 
blurred/out-of- sync/arhythmic. Rhythm is a state of concentration so complete 
it leaves her defenseless, opens to all in tune with 
it. Intonation is her other means/meaning into sensation by which 
her faculties embrace/subvert. To achieve satiation upon embracing she must 
see the world she enlarges (with her art) clearly if 
not without fear. She is its lover and she must 
excite it until its richness rises in response to her 
Afro-centric beauty perceived at last. To open- ly hate and 
fear her lover is to invite rape. She must see 
the hardness in the blood, yet recognize the hardness as 
required for effective penetration/dialogue. Therefore she is the natural enemy 
of social oppression/impotence. She resists the aesthetic softness of a 
society that would sublimate/smother her spirit. In this context her 
subversion is catholic, but given sufficient direction/education her willfulness undermines 
everything false with exacting precision. In the end her society 
will reject or even destroy her. History is clear on 
this point. To insure her place in the world Sapphire 
must make her art her revolution. And in so making 
she must remain undaunted, without compromise. She must be aware 
of the power which extends thru her bones, the profound 
stubborn belief in the absolute importance of her vision.
