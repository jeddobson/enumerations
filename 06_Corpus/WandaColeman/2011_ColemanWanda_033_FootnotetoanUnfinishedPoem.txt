Carmel-by-the-sea is a lonely tree overlooking Pacifica

twice eternity. That was the time I was in the process of

discovering that I was rediscovering Borges, if that's not

too complex? It was the mid-80s and I was doing kamikaze

watch over Berkeley and The Bay. “Bitch, I told you to cease-

and-desist!” Dig, Big Sur, it was long over at Big Sur (damn,

I do so miss that pastrami) although Nepenthe's was still

a gas-gas-gas and for a longer time after that. But you see,

it was truly a matter of urgency as I dived-bombed on

City Lights and found out that Melville was still alive and

workin' the docks. Please don't get me goin' on about all

them unfree radicals, but Tor House just broke my heart, so

you can understand why we blistered when Jean Arthur

made us move our tore-down Skylark out the front of her crib.
