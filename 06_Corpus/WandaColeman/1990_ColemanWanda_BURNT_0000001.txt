1 smog and the gray asthmatic noon 2 the needle's 
prick for chemistries. no blood 3 drawn. i'm fresh out 
4 running on ozone 5 where/what next, shadow boxer? 6 
is it the bell, a horn honk, a scream? 7 
and what is that lump driven over in the street 
8 another hope? another victim of bad weather 9 my 
success is on hold 10 when's the red army marching? 
you should've used 11 protection. you should've abstained 12 you 
should've brushed your teeth, had a headache 13 or gotten 
your degree 14 (in the dark, descending the jagged steep 
spiraling 15 staircase, no end in sight, i look back 
to find it 16 vanishing behind me) 17 the trumpeter 
knows/notes music 18 as salvation. knows and in blowing, completes 
19 sacred cycle of do wah wah---rump-jump mojo 20 by 
rote under prod the albino wino scuttles 21 bag of 
pain in hand, sweating the bottle 22 on his way 
to drop the eternal grape and escape 23 this sweltering 
bump on the devil's ass 24 touched but no feel---smoke 
inhalation 25 (thrombosed veins and i'm not even a junky) 
26 lax and numbing beer/semen-like froth 27 it goes down 
so arrogant this momentary 28 swallowing of the cold gold 
universe 29 lately of late but not too late??? 30 
there's so little happiness in our lives 31 preoccupied with 
what we have not 32 and i'm 33 all used 
up. totaled. all gone 34 lights flashing vacancy. nothin' 'twixt 
my ears 35 and less 'tween my thighs
