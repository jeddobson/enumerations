1 i leave the house thru the front door 2 
he leaves thru the back 3 our dirty little crib 
its paintings and dust 4 jammed with books funked with 
grease and cat 5 hair our nasty little white wooden 
prison its 6 frayed furnishings and roach-ridden appliances 7 our

38 and balled-up pages of my manuscripts 39 he comes
