plastic succubae, they haunted my childhood sleep—those

throbless creatures with odd necks that snapped or crumbled

when thrown from the bed or bashed with a hammer

and i would wake into the welcoming dark, relieved

for those rosy-cheeked specters with fingers that would not part

had vanished and i could will myself to better dreams, forget

those blank voids that caused me cringings—for although

i could not appreciate death, i understood not living
