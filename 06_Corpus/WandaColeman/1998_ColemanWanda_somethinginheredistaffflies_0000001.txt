1 something in here distaff flies 2 bats and dives 
and falls and skitters 3 heart? soul? mind gone foul--- 
4 my eyes all jitters cannot see what Elohim 5 
imprisons me/has made condemnation of my 6 sex/has made my 
skin my people hex 7 he loves to strum and 
"steels" my blues 8 cops my licks and slays my 
muse 9 then stretches out my broken wing 10 and 
mocks the song i'm pained to sing 11 Nepenthe offers 
me no drink 12 as potent as his hatred's stink 
13 what sport will purchase liberty? 14 doth he who 
caged the beast cage me?
