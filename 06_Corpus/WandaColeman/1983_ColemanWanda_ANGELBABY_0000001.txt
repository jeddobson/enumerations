1 morning. she's an ugly bitch 2 map of last 
night's lust grey in grey dawn 3 tracks/lover's dried cum 
at her lips 4 along her neck and breasts litter 
of tourists 5 eager freak seers down star-lined 6 boulevards/her 
mystique 7 click cameras courting the rich/famous/profane 8 abandoned by 
her hasty cockhound 9 moist and sticky between billboards 10 
mocks fame & fortune. she runs an 11 ambivalent tongue 
across 12 plaque caked gums and teeth, tastes 13 bitter 
residue/zeon & cocaine high 14 glitter her eyelashes pepper pillows 
15 hollywood's hills as she struggles 16 to focus in 
on day, head throbs 17 blue and white and pink 
collar traffic headed 18 downtown---feels like she's been gangbanged 19 
by a dozen record execs---hit single in her ears 20 
in bad need of a face-lift, gal---years 21 catching up. 
she grunts, stretches 22 rises shakes and scratches her tangled 
smog-filled 23 crown and stumbles toward the jane 24 queen 
of the jet set no matter how many 25 lovers 
leave her for new york
