visits to the hospital then the hospice

i clean up vomit, pick sheet music up off the floor

at yet another crossroad. no mercy now.

salvation is the providence of dreamers

the nightmare of my son's death has gotten closer

and closer and closer/edge deep-violet

precipice. verge.

leap, fall, or give into the push

(my son found the peace

his mother is ever denied)

if i but knew where he was, i would stretch my wings

rise loudly and fly him home from Home

a call in midafternoon, “orotund, sweeping and final”

goes and is gone. my son. ululate and summon
