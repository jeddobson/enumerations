because i could not afford a grave

he was returned to the Pacific

stopping once midway to rest in our eyes

as i wiped white-flecked sputum from dead lips

it was there, between my hoped-for success

and the exhaustion of overwork for

niggling pay, between the abyss and nevermore,

he swam away on the last wave

arm-in-arm, we wept away the days.

i made a shrine from marble & memories,

and like a dutiful mom, burned candles

on his every anniversary

and here it nears again, the summer of his birth.

i sit alone and touch his journals, unread

still. unable to turn a single page. as if he

were alive to protest, to protect his privacy

truth is, i cannot revisit that year

without a jag that threatens my pose of sanity

without being broken into shards

i carry images of long-stemmed blood roses, merlot and his

gold bracelet lost on a parking lot then found in a prayer

i have never visited here with my son

there was seldom money for travel, and what was

borrowed went for food. we dreamed and died in a

small mean domain—small and lonely—and sweet yet
