1 gone real gone the good die gone 2 strange 
and distant banging wakes me from reverie 3 my bed 
is cold. i am cold but deep long sleep 4 
is good for me 5 it's time for song when 
going gets gone 6 i hear voices sing and shout, 
hear bodies 7 move anxiously about. i hear the 8 
diggings of an eager race for whom i've 9 disappeared 
without a trace 10 grieving of the gone goes on 
and on 11 and now they've rediscovered me. want to 
make use 12 of me. overturn all my stones. make 
a science 13 of my bones. my past once ignored 
in ignominy, they 14 now wish a future built on 
me 15 there is no such thing as coming back 
16 such a strange sensation---the living 17 at my grave 
dying to get in
