1 he keeps falling to pieces 2 right before my 
eyes 3 the pieces of his body in the front 
seat beside 4 me 5 i drive, trying at the 
same time 6 to keep them from falling out of 
the car 7 his hands spill out of the window 
and onto 8 the highway, pulling over to the shoulder 
i rescue them 9 and then his head, it falls 
off his neck tumbling 10 down onto the rubber mat 
11 and his arms, dropping off his torso 12 limp 
beside his frame 13 and i keep trying to put 
him back together 14 and drive at the same time 
15 steering the vehicle west and north 16 putting him 
back together one piece at a time 17 they really 
did a good job on him 18 down at the 
butcher shop 19 they cut out his gut and his 
heart and soul 20 the only thing they left were 
the words, a kindness 21 and somewhere there is a 
piece of him in 22 her bed, rotting 23 and 
somewhere there is a fraction of his 24 mind tied 
up in a restraining jacket 25 it's really a problem 
keeping him together 26 we lost his penis in west 
covina
