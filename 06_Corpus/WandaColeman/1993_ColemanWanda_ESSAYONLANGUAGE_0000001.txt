before slavery my people-tongue (drum) was sure. there were no 
excesses. those who spoke it knew the work of tribal 
time during which they were not native but simply a 
history apart in which the cycles of life played out 
in accordance to the rhythms of that other continent oh 
we all speak eloquently of the introduction of the Atlantic 
into our speech. the middle passage. remember those who dove 
from the dutch ship into the deep, sacrificing themselves and 
their children, who cheated slavery in death. it was at 
this time a spiritual rending and longing (holler) was introduced 
into our tongue so that even now there are those 
still throwing themselves into the sea so-to-speak landed and chained 
our metaphor was denied, was first made "sin" against the 
mores of a slaving race, then "crime." the english tongue 
was enforced/ whipped into our flesh enough to make our 
servitude profitable. with the denial of our tongue, our creeds 
and worships were also denied. (in english our men and 
women have become genderless/interchangeable as "nigger") thus a new sorrow 
was born and it too entered our tongue and created 
a resonance (blues) which distinguishes ours from all european speech 
and sets us apart even from those with whom we 
urge reunion and so we found thru deceit, ways to 
keep our tongue alive. to let it live within us 
though departed from our source. to become the tongue itself 
(attitude) so that it speaks even in our bodily movements. 
so that it seduces english, snaking back to ourselves. so 
that the dominant tongue, once infected with our hunger will 
one day succumb without divining what has happened (unspoken) and 
even now i gibber in my diverse postures, cajoling and 
conjuring. this spell- ing out. this gospel. it is about 
being and recognition of being. my tongue alive in my 
particular vocalizations, chorusing with like others also singing it be 
about bones doin' somethang
