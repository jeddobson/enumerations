5 i've never seen her before 6 the wild-eyed high-yellow 
woman in white 7 crepe dress with tracks of black 
pin-stripes 8 loosely belted at her waist and flapping madly 
9 as she comes racing down the hallway, brunet 10 
hair hard-pressed against her scalp, a rubberband 11 defining her 
ponytail and she's moving so fast it's 12 straight-out behind 
her as she dashes into the 13 room brandishing the 
hypodermic 14 knocking the table and fossil helter-skelter, 15 she 
jabs me in the arm with it, releasing 16 some 
of the substance 17 then she 18 hot-pops herself and 
starts to spazz. i go 19 into shocked rage/feel my 
system fighting a 20 mounting wooziness 21 her eyes roll 
back in her head as she goes 22 down the 
professor trying to help her/save her 23 life others rushing 
to our aid hands grabbing at me 24 as i 
look for something/find my shoe its rubbery 25 thick blackness 
and take the shoe and start slapping 26 the woman 
upside her head even as she slips into coma 27 
screaming "don't suicide on me bitch! 28 don't suicide on 
me! goddamn it don't die 29 before i can kill 
you" 30 why are you so upset, something says, it's 
only a dream 31 abruptly i wake 32 lay there 
staring up into the indigo 33 calming my heart a 
full five 34 minutes before the alarm starts 35 bleeding 
in my ear
