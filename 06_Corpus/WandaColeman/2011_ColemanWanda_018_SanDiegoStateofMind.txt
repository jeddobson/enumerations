i've been here forever on 3 hours of sleep per night

the angel is in the details …

the children have luminous bones

like tropical fish who inhabit volcanic depths. their mentors

cling in clusters like giant tube worms, sightless and glommed to coral

it's hot here and everything i see is through the mist of sweat

rising from scalp cheeks groin

every shoe i have tendered hurts, now—invisible corns

and calluses, nails caffeine embittered, damaged by bouts

of scurvy and Cambodian manicurists

it seems my integrity has gotten me elected

Wicked Witch as westerly as i wannabe—if essentially black

every rim a possibility, every brink an option

should the God of Budgets grant me salary and a sturdy sweep,

i'll attach myself to a reef, fan my tentacles in the irradiated

warmth—glow against the abyss

into which the children flow

iridescent
