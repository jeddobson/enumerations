1 bars of black flesh on celluloid 2 a glitter 
palace structured of purple rage 3 day upon day upon 
daze 4 blues calendar of grand miseries 5 barely subsisting 
on a diet of false hope 6 (shit over shingles) 
7 i bleed stars 8 sentenced for refusing to spill 
the dreams 9 how long before the anthem of my 
pulse 10 slows to a gasping red whine 11 how 
long before i'm starved into betrayal 12 hang by my 
own want 13 who is the keeper of the key 
14 what god has locked me to this land 15 
for failure to believe
