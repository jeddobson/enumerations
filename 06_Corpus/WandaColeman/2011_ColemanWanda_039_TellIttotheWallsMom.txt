useless conversations. the rescuer has checked

out or is consumed in crises. how can he help you

when he can't help himself? you're reputed

for endurance, having survived it all. pick up the

phone. dial the operator. if there's no answer,

appreciate that fact that there is no help for anyone

who isn't suicidal, abused by a Loved One, or dying

quickly of poison. there's no cure for the tax man,

growing old, or having no say-so in your children's lives

there's no pill to fill an empty account or

close the loops that define a romance

don't you get it? this is not your world

(intimacy is too often interrupted

by disaster)

but you're still breathing if that's about to

end. even your love of love is leaving you,

becoming the domain of the lost and stolen

(recovery from shock is minimized

by necessities)

be mollified

those hypocritical bitches weren't going to

make your living for you. (ho-hum)

nevertheless, you have done your best

Beethoven couldn't keep up the rent and they're still rooting around

for Mozart

who do you think you are, not to mention female?

(matters of concern to you are

ignored with malice)

you hooked your wagon to a falling star

might as well enjoy the plummet
