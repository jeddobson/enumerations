1 in blood my blood 2 staining drapes, the divan, 
the print of "pimp tempts woman to 3 whore" 4 
i've penned it tossing restless in cold sheets in 5 
early AMs 6 scrawled it while stalled in eternal lines 
of welfare recipients 7 awaiting word 8 scratched it line 
by pained line 9 into creases of county jail mattresses 
damp with sweat and hope 10 for bail 11 recorded 
this verse a dozen times 12 with my eyes scouring 
endless avenues seeking for rent signs 13 children allowed 14 
i've repeated my never spent agony 15 into countless ears 
of too fucking understanding many who 16 misunderstood 17 so 
i'm writing it again 18 one more time in black 
and white with hope that 19 someone out there will 
at last 20 get it straight
