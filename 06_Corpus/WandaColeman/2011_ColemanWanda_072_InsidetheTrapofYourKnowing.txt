ours is a severed dialectic

i keep trying to tell you something important

about my life but you interrupt me repeatedly

you know about these things. you read them

they are Euclidian and euphonic

may be analyzed & annotated in the hip journals. you

studied them in philosophy generations ago,

it was broadcast. nationwide.

last night

you harbor a superior knowledge that allows

you into my experience before i have it

you know better of course

because you have always known

your science is exact and applied—the universal nature of bars,

the chemical composition of smog & smegma, what governs

the economics of our dialogue, the molecular structure

of the carbohydrates forming the cellulite gathering in my thighs

you know it all—from

Alexander to Zeno of Sidon

you/the authority on emotional pogroms, spiritual

holocausts and the intellectual hajj

we will reduce my disjuncture to the hierarchical nature of man

we will reduce my empty purse to the fact that

melanin loss is the byproduct of aging

we will reduce my son's death to the stress limits of metal

we will curl up in our Justinian cave,

feed the fire with wishes & words

and await the glacier you are certain is icing us over
