1 up central avenue thirty years gone 2 her mouth 
a room for entertaining gents 3 spins tales about meat 
market men 4 how dirty they are make the smell 
between 5 the thighs the funk of mold and old 
gold 6 piss and the reverb of doors swung eternally 
shut 7 on the romance of hasty knocks a visitor's 
8 night entry she was a fancy high-yellow 9 dancer 
along dark narrow hallways tight as 10 "a virgin niggah 
gal's slit, yes Suh!"
