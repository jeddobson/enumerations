1 slain or broken, crippled or bent 2 in defeat 
or madness 3 have wept and moaned with the others 
4 uttered prayers 5 danced endless hours to ward off 
the enemy 6 who stalks us 7 i too have 
spent hours in the hut of the 8 witch doctor 
9 discussing one herb or another, potions, spells 10 some 
juju to shield 11 runners have returned rabid with messages 
12 of doom and horror 13 i also closed my 
ears but my heart sat 14 among my teeth 15 
i have remained motionless so long fat 16 and time 
mock me 17 now everything tastes the same 18 now 
all moons are gray 19 now even the face of 
love is ugly 20 today i dance the war dance. 
today 21 i ready my weapon 22 it is time 
to triumph or die
