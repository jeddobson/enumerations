1 i have stepped into the mirror of my hatred 
and am 2 cut and bleeding 3 the blood falls 
on newsprint/your eyes 4 come laughing back at me like 
sirens clearing the speedway 5 approaching emergency 6 i do 
not know what to do about you 7 that has 
happened to me with other women and men/ 8 betrayal 
9 but i devoted eight years of my life 10 
to shaping and sculpting a fine relationship 11 and now 
it lays across my typewriter jagged and broken 12 i 
was going to spend a hundred dollars of the hard/and 
13 money does come hard for me/earned cash 14 i 
make droning away my life to pay some guy 15 
to throw a blueberry pie in your face, but he 
wasn't into 16 vendettas 17 i have to pass your 
house every other day and 18 i get cold chills 
every time a mutual friend mentions your 19 name 20 
memories i had plunged full fathom five bob up and 
moan 21 boooooooo 22 i cornered your old man, leaning 
angrily out of my car 23 and screamed obscenities and 
incoherencies at him 24 one day while on the way 
to work 25 i told you you were full of 
bullshit, bourgeois nigger bitch 26 i fumed and farted and 
cursed and stomped and pranced and 27 pounded a few 
table tops that bruised my palms 28 in dreams, i 
chopped off your head, strangled you, slapped 29 you and 
spat on you 30 i have tried to make my 
dreams reality by cornering you 31 on neutral territory, but 
you know me well 32 and have avoided me to 
date 33 one day our paths nearly crossed and you 
ran inside and 34 hid in the closet until you 
were sure i was gone---i found 35 out, laughed and 
tried to dismiss you with contempt 36 i have attempted 
to write you out of my system in several 37 
poems 38 and in this one i face you head 
on, but hear only 39 the sound of glass shattering 
and not your screams 40 i whited out your name 
from the dedication in my first 41 poetry book ms 
42 i have done everything but gotten my hands on 
you, so be 43 warned. i'm saving up money for 
bail and i've 44 been to jail before
