1 blue night full of empty streets/my eyes 2 scan. 
any movement. any man. my man. his walk 3 he's 
out there. i wait without waiting 4 hungry. expectant. hot 
5 with the memory of how he feels 6 between 
my thighs the damp sweat of other nights 7 tossing 
restless in the sheets between fantasy and flight 8 where 
is he? 9 blue night full of moon and palm 
trees 10 shadows cast/men move down avenues/sharp footsteps echo 11 
rubber heeled renegades/a mindless romance of bodies 12 needing sex 
money pleasure 13 my eyes follow. register 14 always, the 
memories of how he feels 15 to be satisfied in 
the damp sweat of night 16 tossed starved in sheets 
or sprawled across the floor 17 where did he go? 
18 (defiance is decision: sleep. sleep the sleep of the 
dead 19 i pretend i don't hear him when he 
comes in. pretend that his 20 question remains unuttered. pretend 
that his cool arms 21 have not reached out for 
my warmth or his lips pressed against 22 the back 
of my neck, moist and biting into it. pretend the 
23 physical plane doesn't exist. that i am pure energy 
and his 24 hard dick entering me is a single 
beam of light) 25 where in the fuck is he? 
26 blue bright morning full of purple hills/sunrise 27 light 
spring wind and roses. smell of bacon & hot coffee 
28 i wake without waking. full 29 complete. snuggle up 
to memory 30 how he felt between my thighs still 
damp 31 with last night's sweet sweat good 32 the 
sheets tossed back and singing, a towel 33 for mop-up-after 
stuck between my thighs 34 and there he is 35 
on the pillow next to me curled up and snoring
