forget San Diego. call it Isla Negra

the sweet banishment to a further, bluer South

like that one rediscovered by Basoalto in the early days

before he transformed himself on the eve of my birth

let me speak to him: Ricky Reyes, you sly old cur

you felt me in your shadow, foresaw my love of your lingo

knew there were enchantments only you could cast

because of you i ache for the sweats of summer. i will

never forget how quickly your brightness turned melancholy

how quickly politics made you the fool nursing remorse

but let us speak of this realm and time—you must have

been impressed by the vast ignorance of my country

its disdain for poetry and art. this narrowness has forced me,

like you, to seek residence among the clouds.

i happen to be tired of being stereotyped. i happen

to enter booteries seeking

to relieve the toes on my left foot from torture

to relieve them of my vanity, yet shield them from the eyes

of voyeurs. (lucky you—you married bliss, i married a blister)

otherwise, i abhor setting foot to earth or concrete.

should leukemia be added to the list of bard-consuming maladies

like absinthe, tuberculosis, and peaking early?

my Spanish is rusty with disuse. i translate you

into the language of moths

no, Basoalto. you are only my second favorite

my first is the one who robbed your heart at Valparaiso

stealing words like bread like gold like bones
