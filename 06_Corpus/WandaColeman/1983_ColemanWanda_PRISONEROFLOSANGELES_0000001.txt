1 in cold grey morning 2 comes the forlorn honk 
of workbound traffic 3 i wake to the video news 
report 4 the world is going off 5 rising, i 
struggle free of the quilt 6 & wet dreams of 
my lover dispel 7 leave me moist and wanting 8 
in the bathroom 9 i rinse away illusions, brush my 
teeth and 10 unbraid my hair 11 there're the children 
to wake 12 breakfast to conjure 13 the job 14 
the day laid out before me 15 the cold corpse 
of an endless grind 16 so this is it, i 
say to the enigma in the mirror 17 this is 
your lot/assignment/relegation 18 this is your city 19 i find 
my way to the picture window 20 my eyes capture 
the purple reach of hollywood's hills 21 the gold eye 
of sun mounting the east 22 the gray anguished arms 
of avenue 23 i will never leave here
