1 loud. funk blast thru walls 2 i feel it 
clear across the street 3 in the car, kicked back 
4 surreptitious sips of sweet ros√© from a paper cup 
5 cools, cuts the smog 6 conjures up visions: our 
last time in bed 7 him pounding into me/base count 
8 neighborhood of colors 9 black brown red orange beige 
& gold faces 10 beat down places conceal unexpected treasure 
11 unmeasurable orgasm of tongue to 12 greasy red sauced 
ribs texarkana style 13 i wait 3 hrs for him 
to reappear 14 from the house where rhythm & blues 
scream 15 his score of cocaine and marijuana 16 hidden 
in his jock 17 our last moment together 18 on 
a street corner at midnight 19 i watch young thin 
black dreams 20 skate by on their way to the 
pool hall 21 to hustle errands for dimes & quarters 
22 satisfied 23 not knowing the story 24 or how 
it ends
