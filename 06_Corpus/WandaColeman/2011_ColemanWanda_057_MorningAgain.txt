the escape you fashioned from blackest sleep

on cool and unseemly air rips as you awake

within the usual confinementsâ€”skin muscle sinew bone

eyes bugging at the first douse of consciousness, then

blinking away what has gathered in corners in thoughts

as you are beset by a beastly heavy weariness that

boogies through your chest leaving in its bloody wake

rage confusions unanticipated deaths lancing cries/echoes.

they are gone yet you skirrrkle on and on and on
