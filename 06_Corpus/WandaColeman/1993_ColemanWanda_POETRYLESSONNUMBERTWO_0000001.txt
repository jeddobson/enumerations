1 At the party I was asked to share my 
work as fledgling 2 ethnic poet. 3 It was obvious 
I had it somewhere on me. Anxious, I 4 went 
into my 5 purse for my notebook/a concealed weapon. Blanching 
with 6 just enough 7 humility I read my stuff 
eloquently, tossing rude epithets 8 and graphic 9 images/pearls of 
street wisdom espousing Black power 10 get-the-honky 11 and self-determination. 
12 This gray-haired white guy approached and gave off an 
13 air of relaxed 14 well-read authority which was refreshingly 
lacking in 15 arrogance. He 16 explained that he edited 
a small literary magazine and 17 asked to 18 see 
my poems on the page. 19 Smugly I showed him 
my notebook. He read silently for a 20 few minutes 
21 as I watched him turn the pages with what 
I felt to be the 22 proper amount 23 of 
attention deserved. I expected acceptance johnny-on-the- 24 spot. Then he 
25 dead-eyed me and said flatly, "These look very familiar." 
26 Disappointed and confused by this comment, I chattily 27 
suggested my 28 poems had somehow come across his desk 
even though I 29 had never made 30 the submission. 
They remained painfully unpublished. He 31 shook his 32 head, 
lowered his eyes and said quietly, "Perhaps." 33 This conversation 
troubled me several weeks before the 34 dark raised 35 
and I finally understood his way of saying 36 my 
work lacked 37 originality
