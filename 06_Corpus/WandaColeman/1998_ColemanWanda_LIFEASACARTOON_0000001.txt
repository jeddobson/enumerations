1 (penned in a multicultural rainbow--- 2 someone's gettin' globs 
off the concept) 3 ink peepo 4 in the mean 
mean Santa Claus, his voluminous rosy 5 cheeks, his "gotcha 
coon" gray-eyes shooting sparks, 6 with large well-manicured hands, sets 
giant 3-layered 7 red-white-and-blue cake on the table before a 
modern-day 8 ink spot, MIZ stick figure in her triangle 
skirt and 9 hoop earrings nearly big as her head. 
10 Panel 1: He takes a giant butcher's knife and 
splits 11 the cake down the middle. 12 Panel 2: 
Santa pushes her cake half in front of 13 MIZ 
stick figure, whose heart jumps out of 14 her chest 
with joy and relief. 15 Caption: After centuries of slavery, 
servitude, share- 16 cropping, poverty and privation, you Blacks 17 
have earned your share of America at last. 18 Panel 
3: Big lick of icing missing. Santa sucks glob 19 
from his forefinger, having sampled her side 20 of the 
cake. MIZ stick figure licks her lips. 21 Caption: Ummmmm. 
Tastes gooood. You'll love it. 22 Panel 4: Stick figure 
draped in mantilla appears at 23 table as Santa lowers 
the knife, cuts MIZ half 24 into fourths. 25 Caption: 
BUT---of course we don't want to forget Maria, 26 over 
here, who's scrubbed my floors for years. 27 Panel 5: 
A stick figure in coolie hat and another with 28 
giant feather on knot of head appear. MIZ-half of 29 
the cake is cut into eighths. 30 Caption: And we 
certainly can't forget Asia and Cherokee! 31 Tri-Panels 6 through 
8: MIZ stick figure surrounded by 32 clamoring throng of 
various other stick figures. 33 The knife in rapid swing 
as Santa, suit shirt 34 sleeves rolled back to his 
elbows, furiously 35 chops away at MIZ-half of cake 36 
Insert: Close on MIZ stick figure in sweaty daze as 
37 question marks snake-dance above her kink head. 38 Caption: 
We are a nation of ignoramuses! 39 Panel 9: All 
the others have taken their share of cake and 40 
skedaddled. Confused, MIZ stick figure bug-eyes 41 CRUMB which is 
all that's left of her cake half. 42 Santa has 
ALL of his half. 43 Caption: Racism has ended. I 
gave you all YOU deserve 44 and all you're gonna 
get. Happy days are here 45 again!!! Hohohohoho.
