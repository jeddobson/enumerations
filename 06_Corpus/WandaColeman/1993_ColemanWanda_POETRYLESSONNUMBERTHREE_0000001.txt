1 solikeman have you read this cat's stuff 2 like 
he's a believer man, dig, you should really 3 hear 
this 4 and he shuffles the papers at me, Paul 
does 5 with deep admiration, kicks back and renders me 
6 speechless, his gray eyes tearing. the words sing 7 
of bird holiday dolphy 8 solikeman, this cat is legend 
should be as famous 9 as anybody. was there at 
the beginning. like when 10 The Beat Thing was really 
happenin'. he believes 11 in The Muse, man, he believes 
12 what's that? i ask 13 what's what? 14 what 
is The Muse? 15 likeGreekman, Erato, the godwomanlover of lyrical 
16 verse, man. dig, you should meet this guy. he's 
pure 17 and bring some of your stuff. the cat 
is beautiful 18 you'll see 19 so we go west 
to Venice for the hang. we find him 20 in 
the back of the big space filled with empty 21 
folding chairs and a handful of acolytes rattling 22 around 
the mike. Paul slobbers all over himself making 23 with 
the intros. the man is frail, bent, not as old 
as he 24 looks, ill and perhaps dying (i've heard). 
his long salt but 25 mainly pepper hair tied back 
in a long slim ponytail, white 26 hands trembling. Paul 
emotes something recently written 27 what'd you think man. what'd 
you think? 28 the beautiful cat leans into his cane 
with one hand, 29 holds out the other 30 let 
me see it. 31 he takes the poem and reads 
it closely, smiles, returns it 32 not bad. keep at 
it, Paul. 33 she's a poet too, man, like amateur, 
but she's 34 trying, dig? can you look at one 
of her pieces 35 justaminute ifyoudon'tmind? she's got it right 
here 36 i go into my purse and shyly hand 
him a couple of 37 pages. he reads them and 
smiles. word eyes glitter 38 you've got something. 39 but 
she needs work, doesn't she man? Paul says 40 doesn't 
she need work? 41 find your mentors, young lady. all 
great poets have 42 had their mentors 43 we go 
outside and stroll the boardwalk in 44 contemplation. Paul is 
restless and upset 45 did you hear what the cat 
said to you back there 46 did you hear that? 
47 hear what? 48 he liked your shit, man. he 
really dug your 49 shit, man. i know the cat. 
he never talks to me like that 50 like what? 
51 he said you've got something 52 come on, are 
you jealous? 53 hell no, man. i just wish he'd 
respond to me the 54 way he responds to you 
55 forget it, Paul. besides, i don't believe all 56 
that muse stuff anyway. it's a lot of hooey 57 
nomanno! how can you say something like that? The 58 
Muse is for real. i know. and it's so goddamn 
hard 59 to create without her. you know what i 
mean. like 60 inspiration. like from above 61 he took 
an exaggerated look skyward 62 it's just that if i 
waited around for some muse 63 i wouldn't get much 
done 64 i don't know about you, man, idon'tknowaboutchew 65 
you shouldn't say things like that 66 huh? 67 that's 
sacrilege, man. sacrilege 68 i don't tell him i don't 
know the meaning of the 69 word. when we get 
home later we make love and 70 afterwards i go 
and look it up in the unabridged 71 while he's 
snoring
