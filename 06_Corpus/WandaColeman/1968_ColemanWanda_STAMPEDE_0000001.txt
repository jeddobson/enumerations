1 my mind belly an elephant 2 these gnats no 
matter how many i eat 3 are not filling 4 
must be a finer feast elsewhere, but where? 5 comes 
weeping 6 gale winds blowing lightning 7 comes weeping 8 
clash thunder against panes flesh 9 comes weeping 10 howls 
nightmare blizzard blackness 11 my mind yawning hunger the elephant 
12 whose memory detailed and varied sucks 13 the bone 
of each experience 14 licks and remembers spicy leaves love 
15 comes weakening 16 kneeling at phallic altar 17 comes 
weakening 18 gnawing at womb's mouth 19 comes weakening 20 
pounding of pulse sex longing 21 my mind belly an 
elephant 22 these fleas who call themselves men pick at 
my 23 heavily skinned torso---it is an annoyance 24 there 
must be a comforting river in which to bathe 25 
comes sleeping 26 closing waters overhead 27 my bed and 
sullaged blankets drying out 28 comes sleeping 29 wine warm 
tender illusion 30 my mind belly burps hunger cramp nausea 
31 for lack of proper food 32 i have escaped 
the zoo and wander senselessly 33 searching spicy leaves, succulent 
shafts 34 forest, jungles and woods
