so hard to heart through to the other side of you

the moon was here and framed in a sky of fire red

there above our bed love's corona made a frame

therein you pictured sweetums as you lay asleep

as if on an eagle's back or reddened in a lion's heart

and stupid cupid fired each flaming arrow there

crosstown traffic was clogged with red desire

fire engines screaming down the frames

of lanes, making music fly from fools asleep

like we's all voodoo children making stickpin hearts

for while love in misty eyes might take me there

it's so hard to frame a thought around you

you got me floatin' in and out of frames

where mountain lions roam and fire eagles sleep

while you're a million miles from my heart

this world is speeding ever spinning in its frame

to where? i just don't know, but still it's you.

look out! look out! my sleepy eyes are turning red

arrows made of fire's desire pierce my sleep

love floats framed in your misty eye-of-heart

the only thing i need is you to get me there.

speeding fool through traffic. there. home to you

making false love naturally a fiery redness blues

each step each stroke i take outside your frame

there voodoo children gather and dance hearts

into fire and yeah, i'm burning sleep right there

fool discordant heart strumming cool to you

making blues as naturally afire as blood is red

for a million miles from you is impossible to

frame while making love to you in our dream

the only thing i need? sleep will take me there

where i will feel on fire making love to you

with moons everythere and red dramas of you, our

hearts gushing desires, bodies framed in sweatâ€”

my eagle's nest the fiery lion of your sleep revealing

misty wonders there within a thrum-crossed heart

a kind of you-me voodoo frames our mystery

deep in heart's sleep, there where love's eagles fly

through fire red skies and lions hum
