1 to be dust 2 to be dust 3 i 
want to be dust 4 sepia earth the wind blows 
5 down faded ghetto streets 6 past walkers 7 cryers 
8 screamers 9 dreamers 10 i want to be dust 
11 whirling along with the fumes from 12 cadillac exhaust 
13 settling in liquor store windows 14 getting black children 
funky 15 riding on the breeze 16 thru rat infested 
yards 17 down alleyways 18 catching roaches by surprise 19 
burning in the eyes of winos 20 i want to 
be dust 21 escaping my body's prison 22 free from 
pain of loneliness 23 free from eyes that watch, 24 
from hands that finger 25 ME 26 i want to 
be dust 27 to be dust 28 to be dust 
29 and 30 just 31 blow 32 away
