1 this time only one body on the divan 2 
rhythm mortis/soul creep/holed out 3 this time no limbs askew 
4 (she believes in 5 tidy endings) 6 one electric 
eyeball winks dingy melodrama 7 overhead a blues beacon 8 
sweetly radiant heavenward. this time 9 the silent stereo. a 
bass monotone pulses up from the 10 apartment below 11 
penetrates the floor 12 woman causes fizzle in suicide attempt 
13 turns on the gas then empties 14 her mind 
15 this time beyond novelty 16 this time beyond television. 
this time 17 no bruises. no sigh/sign of solipsistic violence 
18 mere limp pricked resignation and terminal relief 19 (she 
loves him she always 20 loves him always) 21 no 
blood pools. no semen spills 22 no rape no murder 
no needle 23 this time there's no chance of schematic 
mishap/discovery 24 by friends (nobody evah drops by 'ceptin' strays 
25 sniffin' for pussy) 26 nuthin' 27 but cold lifeworn 
flesh and the rugless bare waxed floor 28 the obscene 
intrusive electric eyeball 29 this time 30 it is painful/slow 
31 laying stares on the ceiling/rampant thoughts 32 seeking bone-soaking 
rest and fetal sleep 33 the simplicity of carbon monoxide 
34 and headlines 35 the pathologist will note a last 
meal of 36 bile and Sartre 37 this time. no 
tears no rush no sting 38 no thrill of expectation 
no finger pops no do-wops 39 no so-longs no you-done-me-wrongs 
40 and this time. no savior
