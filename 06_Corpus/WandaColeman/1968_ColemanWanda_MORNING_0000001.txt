1 he sleeps late he sleeps dead as he sleeps 
he 2 waits 3 he waits for me to rise 
and take care of it 4 he waits for me. 
stirs as the alarm goes off and i 5 fumble 
around for my robe in the dark 6 he stirs 
briefly and goes back to cop a couple of hours 
of death 7 embraces death even as he fights the 
dread of aging 8 getting old he waits 9 because 
something will save him. something will come 10 at the 
last minute and rescue him 11 from his fate. something 
vital alive and beautiful 12 while i rise and grope 
in the dark angered by my disrupted 13 dreams 14 
the dreams that never come true because they can't 15 
in this life bitterly mine that chills me in cold 
drizzle 16 as i stub my toe against the hard 
wood table groping 17 for my robe 18 in the 
dark before sunrise 19 while he embraces the pillow and 
i wonder 20 what will rescue me from this 21 
know only my sweat and struggle will save me if 
22 i'm to be saved and i realize i haven't 
fully given up 23 haven't fully resigned myself 24 i 
fight it i fight it 25 in the dark as 
i grope 26 for the warmth of my robe angry 
at him as he 27 snores and tosses in the 
pillows 28 and i find my robe 29 put it 
on and bless its comfort and disappear 30 into the 
white sanctity of light 31 the light that brings sweat 
and struggle the light 32 that blinds me for a 
second 33 before it all becomes too clear
