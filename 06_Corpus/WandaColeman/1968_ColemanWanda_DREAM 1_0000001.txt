1 young bloods got me we riding in the car 
2 yes i value my life yes like on tv 
or a bad movie 3 they say "empty your purse" 
and of course i cooperate 4 they are young, impatient 
5 in do rags and earrings 6 the one in 
front pulls out the baretta 7 he doesn't like what 
i say 8 that i say anything 9 "please don't 
shoot me" 10 and the gun throbs the bullet bites 
thru 11 my stomach. i feel a second slug lodge 
in 12 my forehead 13 i keep thinking i don't 
want to die so young 14 i don't want to 
die this way black on black 15 black against black 
16 i want to see my son grow to man 
17 and my lover---how hurt he'll be 18 i slump 
into the back seat of the car 19 hear one 
of them say 20 "come on, man---let's get out of 
here" 21 they don't know and they don't care 22 
as i wake up monday morning 23 late for work
