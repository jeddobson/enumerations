1 not gravity. the weight of worry 2 holds me 
to earth 3 lately i am a dweller under music 
with antennae 4 and gills. i move with the obscene 
certainty 5 of instinct. with the rolling joyful glide of 
6 sultry rhythms. a new form venturing 7 among coral 
8 it is the swamp that feeds me. the bittersweet 
9 things i find on the underside that scuttle 10 
on the surface, wade helplessly in my path 11 grow 
without sun, thriving on the 12 vulcanic radiance of meaning 
13 not gravity. the weight of my desire 14 holds 
me to him 15 as we meet/the genetically programmed mating 
of 16 different species/a secret race which peoples 17 the 
devonian doom of a subterranean past. 18 i am impregnated 
19 with the memory of his longing 20 a weakened 
seed gains strength in my blood 21 takes root in 
my word as i crawl toward shore 22 and give 
birth 23 not gravity. the weight of ancestral pain 24 
holds me to strive 25 to break free of a 
murky history to leap beyond 26 its fictions/brave the treacherous 
currents of 27 melancholy straits. propelled by blind 28 devotion 
i swim toward the unknowable 29 not gravity. love 30 
weights me to earth
