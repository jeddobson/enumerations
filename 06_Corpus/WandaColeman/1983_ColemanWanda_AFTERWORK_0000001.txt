1 he comes by to see me 2 we eat 
and talk with the kids 3 and watch television 4 
or go out to a movie 5 and beneath it 
all, tensions 6 why he can't come back like before 
7 why i cant take being bumped anymore 8 two 
lean dogs hungry for the fat of a pig's life 
9 livin' black/stuck on the bottom/burnt 10 but we don't 
talk about those transitory things 11 we drive up the 
hill 12 and hold hands as we look out 13 
at all the million lights spelling los angeles 14 in 
breath stopping panorama 15 and then we fuck in the 
front seat 16 of his brother's car 17 like guilt 
driven teenagers 18 crazy in love
