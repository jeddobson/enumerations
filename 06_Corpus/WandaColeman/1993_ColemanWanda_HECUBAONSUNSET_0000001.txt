1 i went to the well to wash my toe 
2 traversing the backside of Vermont in my usual snit 
3 loaded down my purse my thermos my notebooks the 
4 weight of my hate my brain-rotting job the weight 
5 of my anger at social injustice the weight of 
6 survival worries as i jaywalk the street 7 behind 
the burger stop a high yellow man in his 30s 
8 in dayglow hard hat, candy-apple red shirt and beige 
9 corduroys sits on the wall next to the parking 
lot 10 he eats from the deep olive drab industrial 
garbage 11 bin. as i pass him i'm stunned by 
the fierce slam 12 of a cold baked potato against 
my head thrown with 13 full force of his wrath. 
i burst into pain-shocked 14 tears and turn to confront 
him as he explodes in 15 a patois of yells 
16 "ya killed mah daughter! ya killed mah daughter!" 17 
i smell his blood monkey and decide to deny him 
18 orgasm. for weeks after i wonder what set him 
off. 19 my hospital identity badge? was his dead child 
a 20 figment of advanced schizophrenia? was i an 21 
unsuspecting double of his brute torment? 22 what time old 
witch?
