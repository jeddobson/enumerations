The masterful bastard drank what he could of her. She was

life-and-death in the perfect little black schmatta,

just the pupil for him to school in a few things. Remember

Spy versus Spy?—quick-swallowed the skank whole today,

threw it up yesterday. Have invested the spew for tomorrow,

righteously living and working with bottom-out hopes

dining voraciously on alley cat, stray dog, and opossum

the roadkill outside the temple—a house in white light

where the residents express their jealousies by

eating whatever is found in the shallow end of the pool.
