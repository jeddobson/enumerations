1 i am listening for your footfalls, life! 2 i 
am here. waiting. with my ancient hammer, a 3 hangman's 
rope and a butcher's knife. i shall 4 pound your 
head as you ease through the door. 5 i shall 
drag your groggy body into the gloom 6 and dispel 
it. i shall bind your wrists and 7 hold you 
for ransom. i shall steal your laughter 8 and drink 
your pain. from your confusion i shall 9 fashion songs, 
dance and chant my victory stomp 10 a ritual my 
father passed over done taught me 11 the lotus moon 
is a lover's wound 12 it frees the red/my bloodjoy 
13 runs running running 14 soaks the earth
