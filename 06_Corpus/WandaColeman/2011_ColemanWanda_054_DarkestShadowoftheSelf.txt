nothing there is with which to rebuild the humanity stolen

from her umber-nippled breasts. she remembers no time supernal

when she was at rest, recalls no happiness

save one resplendent pregnancy by a deceitful lover

hair of joshuas & screwbean mesquite/wild song wilder pulse

so powerful the night moves through us

so powerful our bodies joined

she sleeps with three eyes open

mouth twisted in curses and spells

between listenings for sidewinder or coyote

her tongue the Mojave floor, eyes reddened at moonset

soundâ€”the crush of bones, the rend & rush of flesh

screams of final ecstasy dusk till dawn

zebra-tailed, she comes, exhausted with her doings

she is the knowing between blood & gravity

she is the formidable, without compassion
