i appear at the desk and present my papers the 
wheat-colored guard in gray uniform has me sign the register. 
he points to the elevators. they are spacious and clean. 
i enter one and press the button and it rises. 
exiting, i move to my left down cream-colored corridors trimmed 
in tea-rose and sea green past door after door until 
i come to an oval recep- tion area. the neatly 
gray-uniformed woman behind the desk is the color of wheat. 
she takes my papers and tells me to sit. she 
goes into the computer terminal and updates my stats. there 
is an old umber-skinned snaggle-toothed woman strapped on a gurney 
in the hallway. in garbled croaks she says she must 
go to the bathroom or else she's going to pee 
on herself. the recep- tionist takes no notice. she hands 
me back the papers and points. i follow her finger, 
walk past the old woman, and enter a maze of 
more softly-lit cream-colored corridors. i follow the arrows, avoiding the 
luminous green exit signs, passing rooms marked "in use" and 
empty waiting rooms where television monitors air daytime soap opera 
after daytime soap. i waft along the cor- ridors moving 
with anticipation. suddenly the corridor reverberates with the authoritative tenor 
of an unseen white male droning "you must cooperate if 
we are going to help you" the corridor ends in 
a doorway marked "success." i turn the knob and enter. 
behind a desk sits a small, bearded, wheat-colored, gray-suited man. 
idly he fingers a smith & wesson, looks up to 
see me. "good," he smiles, "i was afraid you'd woken 
up"
