1 no not skin but graham cracker crust 2 crumbles 
and blows away 3 no not eyes but portals to 
limbo 4 (what life? where?) 5 no not lips but 
the sardonic grimace of volcanic gape 6 emoting magma 7 
no head on this but a mass of kinetic contradictions 
8 held by the force of consequence 9 (assuming a 
rigid cultural posture) 10 no---no neck, no trunk 11 my 
extremities have escaped and knock around 12 writhe and wiggle 
minus identity 13 i'm not here. i'm out of touch 
14 ears?
