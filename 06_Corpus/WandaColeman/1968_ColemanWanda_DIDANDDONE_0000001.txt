i pull up into the driveway 6 her beat-up dodge 
is there 7 fireside dressed like a man i want 
to clown 8 she's backknifed me. i want to kick

mouth 12 i was at the computer playing doctor doctor 
13 i prowled the homes of friends who were not 
in 14 i tried to accept the fact that they 
would continue to fuck and 15 fuck 16 over me.

a saturday night special 18 the weight of it in 
my hand promises/a pregnant cat 19 gives birth to a 
clip/a litter of shiny bald shells. on each 20 i 
wrote his name then hers 21 under the mantle they 
are gone 22 not what was done but how. after 
killing them over and over 23 i cried out loud 
a blast/rent/burst open 24 they will not stay buried 25 
ghosts. i believe in them 26 to be haunted. life's 
subtlest pleasure. to turn, sudden 27 catch a glimpse. the 
apparition fades 28 as though never was 29 night. the 
sleep. the deep sleep 30 it comes so easy
