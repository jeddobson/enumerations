1 she walks walking 2 walked 3 all thru life 
4 walks 5 restless like her people 6 waiting to 
see 7 what happens 8 knowing it will never happen 
9 until after she's dead 10 old lady 11 there 
are so many things 12 i want to ask you 
13 but i have no voice 14 she walks walking 
15 up and down the sidewalk 16 nylons knotted below 
her knees 17 at times my loneliness hers 18 she 
is the me 19 i meet in nightmares
