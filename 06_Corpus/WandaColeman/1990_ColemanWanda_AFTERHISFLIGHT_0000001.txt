1 we're back to square one 2 begin. try. a 
new job. a renewed effort 3 winter is coming (he's 
restless, i'm uptight) 4 august, his smile gone, there are 
tears 5 wrenching boy-tears becoming a man 6 anxious to 
snatch the world; steal it 7 bring it home stuffed 
in a vase, note attached: 8 this belongs to us 
9 right now. i give it to you 10 love 
11 around us, sky clouds 12 turns gray angry protest 
13 blots out the sun 14 the freeway, she smiles 
15 din/hum/lullaby of spinning wheels 16 late night traffic whispers 
hurry hurry 17 palms guard our passage 18 ancient orbs 
scope the window shades 19 as we douse the light
