1 she calls me up and tells me 2 she 
saw him just the day before and asks 3 how 
things are between us 4 all giggles 5 then she 
calls a week later. she saw her 6 just the 
day before and asked how things were 7 and they

back when 11 we were planning to make the big 
splotch 12 and jaw about how we failed 13 reminisce 
about the strange shit that went down---those 14 midnight rides 
to Pasadena 15 how we ran the radio loud in 
case of bugs 16 smoked bush and sipped granache ros√© 
17 and how the cadre flourished and whatever happened 18 
to the money? well---it was an illusion 19 anyway. She 
left her message 20 clawed into my heart with that 
long lush crimson 21 tongue of hers 22 which is 
why i never call back 23 she gets off in 
my ear
