1 we play hand games while Daddyboy waits for 2 
his friend, Garland 3 to come help him get the 
Pontiac started. he put 4 the hood up and it 
screeched on its hinges, 5 then he climbed in beside 
me on the driver's seat 6 with all the straw 
stuffing coming out, 7 and the springs 8 showing, and 
jerked the choke again and again 9 and all the 
buggy did was shudder, rattle and wheeze. 10 it's cold 
in 11 the mornings and Mama's already left the house 
12 so 13 we play to keep warm. first i 
get my forefingers 14 caught in this twisty brown and 
orange tube thing 15 Daddy had in his coat pocket 
and the harder i pull 16 the more it hurts. 
then Daddy shows me the secret. 17 relax, push 18 
my fingers go forward and out they slip. then we 
share 19 Crackerjacks and i get the prize silver poodle 
charm 20 at the bottom 21 of the box but 
Papa swallows all the juicy red peanuts. 22 then he 
makes the church and the steeple and i open 23 
the door and all the people sing A Mighty Fortress 
24 Is Our God 25 he opens all five fingers 
and i close my five fingers 26 and plant my 
fist on top of his. he snaps his fingers 27 
shut as i snatch my fist away giggling wildly. he 
opens 28 the bloom of his hand and again, i 
plant my fist. snap, 29 i'm caught 30 and can't 
get free. and he squeezes and i struggle 31 to 
get free and he urges me to keep trying and 
32 keep trying 33 and finally i start to sniffle, 
then take my free hand 34 and make a 35 
bird and the bird rises and pecks his nose. startled 
36 he squawks and frees my tiny fist but to 
this day, 37 i feel his grasp
