1 papa do you hear the grass grow? 2 do 
you talk rainbow 3 papa do you feel earth tremor 
4 on its axis? 5 what kind of jazz do 
the planets blow? 6 can you knot one end of 
time 7 to the other? 8 can you navigate the 
doubt between 9 hope and despair? 10 in which universe 
is justice found? 11 how much laughter will it take 
12 to fill your absence?
