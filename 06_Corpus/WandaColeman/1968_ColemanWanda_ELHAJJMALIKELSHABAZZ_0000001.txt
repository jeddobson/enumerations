1 yes. they have taken your tongue 2 still you 
speak 3 yes. you dared and were damned 4 by 
your own skin 5 black hands took you but have 
not 6 taken you 7 bullets slew you but have 
not slain you 8 blood spilled out of you that 
day 9 blood running out and spilling 10 into us 
11 where you live 12 where the black phoenix rises 
in our hearts 13 forever
