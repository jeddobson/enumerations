1 mass migration began in the 50s 2 we observed 
their withdrawal and kept note 3 we lived in their 
midst 4 the ones in the house on our left, 
a strange pair 5 they always crossed their yard on 
tiptoe 6 as children, my brother and i watched them 
7 through the thick barrier of morning glory vines 8 
and peach trees 9 the female always wore an expression 
of dread 10 and kept peeking over her shoulders 11 
in our direction 12 the male seemed less afraid but 
nevertheless 13 cautious. one time they saw us watching 14 
and stood stark still, frozen 15 in the light of 
our 16 amazed inquiry 17 in 1956 18 they were 
all over the elementary school 19 grounds 20 but within 
two years they were all going 21 and by 1958 
when i graduated 22 most were gone. i didn't miss 
them 23 but wondered where they had gotten to 24 
and why 25 when we traveled north, south, west or 
east 26 away from our home 27 we saw that 
there were plenty of them 28 and even as the 
face of our neighborhood blackened 29 there were still two 
nests of them stubbornly 30 resistant. but these were elderly 
survivors 31 and eventually died out 32 by 1961 it 
was apparent. something was amiss 33 i was in junior 
high school. 34 again, they were everywhere. i claimed two 
35 in friendship. but one spring there were rumors 36 
and the yellow buses came 37 and they all got 
on, including my two friends 38 and went off to 
visit the new school 39 and when they returned they 
told me they were 40 moving onward after the summer 
41 we'd be friends no more 42 by 1964 they 
had all gone from the throbbing 43 black heart of 
the city 44 there were a few unable to flee 
due to some 45 circumstance of age or economy. and 
by this time 46 we were no longer concerned with 
their leaving 47 for the swallows were returning from Mexico 
48 after the Revolt of August 1965 49 they were 
rarer still. only a few stubborn 50 species remained: the 
blue-coated throat choker, 51 the red-fisted money grubber, the purple-livered 
52 land snatcher, the green-beaked dope dabbler and 53 the 
magenta-throated street strutter 54 it is claimed by some 55 
that one day they will all 56 virtually disappear 57 
and by others 58 that this carnivorous bird of prey 
59 will persist 60 not only in our destruction 61 
but in its own
