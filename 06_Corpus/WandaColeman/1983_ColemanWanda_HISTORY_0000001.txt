1 today god is not home 2 she is out 
seducing beggars 3 she turns his wine sour 4 makes 
his seed sterile 5 withers his hope 6 harridan 7 
there is no desire in me to combat the years. 
i look forward 8 this bird her wings spread 9 
rises from the ash of his flesh 10 "what you 
need is a sugar daddy" 11 sweet his flesh is 
sweet as california october air 12 sweet his touch as 
sweet as the first spoon of ice cream 13 sweet 
his fuck sweet as plum wine 14 last night he 
came for money 15 a dinner of pork and rice 
16 the baby's smile 17 a few hours of television 
18 to be part of this life for a moment 
19 and after he took me 20 quick against the 
floor 21 so there will be a job maybe 22 
and the psych wants to talk to him again 23 
and i keep wondering about all the 24 shit making 
it impossible: living 25 black to black 26 "it's better," 
the gypsy said 27 "with this guy cuz he's got 
the same kind of skin i've got" 28 tomorrow i 
may escape the box 29 fanfare will sound 30 the 
top pop open 31 i will leap into space and 
never come down
