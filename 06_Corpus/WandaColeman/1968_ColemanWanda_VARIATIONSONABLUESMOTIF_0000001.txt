1 he brought nothing 2 took everything i had 3 
destroyed me when he left 4 he brought too much, 
took too much 5 destroyed me when he stayed too 
long 6 he brought nothing 7 blossomed into my heart 
8 left roses 9 the one i never got enuff 
of 10 he left ghosts 11 he brought hope---days of 
it 12 and leaving, left love
