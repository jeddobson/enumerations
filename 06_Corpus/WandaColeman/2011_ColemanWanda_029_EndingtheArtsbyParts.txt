In progress there is an ending of parts. Yesterday

There was the daily flushing. And tomorrow morning

We shall have evacuation after squirming. But today,

Today we have ending by parts. Jejunum

Glistens like glowing coal in vast underbellies

And in tandem we have ending of arts.

This is the lower rung of the navel. And this

Is the upper pook of the navel, which remains firm

Whether in or out, you see. And this particular navel

Is an outie, outed and ousted mid last century,

Which in contemplation we've got hot.

This is the booby hatch, chock full of anxious releasees

Flicking their greasy thumbs. And please do not flip-off

The hired hands with middle fingers. Although politicians

Have extra strength in their thumbs. We minorities

Are happy and childlike, never quite able to

Wring sense from brains or fingers.

And this, you can see, is Ms. Dolt. The purpose of her

Is to cram her into the breech. She can be slid

Rapidly forwards and backwards: we call this mental

Masturbation or Muse. Rapidly back and forth such efforts

Yet aesthetic values molder pristinely on paper.

They call it springing the Beast.

Once the Beast is sprung it eats: tough stuff, requiring

The collective strength of the arts. Like the dolt trying

To fill the breech, self-motivated, self-inspired, empowered,

Which comes rarer and rarer as art cedes to commodity,

Its decline in value ending all in parts.
