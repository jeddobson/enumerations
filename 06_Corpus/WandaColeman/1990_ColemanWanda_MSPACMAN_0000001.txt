1 video fever comes late. i am found 2 in 
the neighborhood family arcade dropping quarters 3 i race the 
phosphorescent yellow critter across the diagram 4 eating dots as 
she zooms 5 something in this computer chase sweats me 
6 it's not a game i'm good at---neck and arms 
tensed 7 tongue against teeth 8 i've gulped the cherry 
raspberry, orange and pretzel 9 once i scored the apple, 
but the pear and banana elude me 10 i can't 
stand being watched by better players 11 when the pastel 
spooks trap my glowing yellow self 12 i curse loudly 
and ignore the stares 13 i'm careful not to blow 
many quarters---even this 14 engrossing little chase is luxury--- 15 
my metaphor my life (the harder i play the lower 
i score) 16 as the board promises a goal of 
5000 points plus free 17 game--- 18 too little for 
too much effort i pursue my dramas/those 19 tasty shimmery 
blue spooks bursting into points i'm certain 20 will put 
me over 21 but don't
