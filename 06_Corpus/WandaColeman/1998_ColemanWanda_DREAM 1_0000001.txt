1 a chunk of my heart breaks away and floats 
off 2 to San Francisco. his mop of 3 semi-kinky 
hair is sandy like his father's 4 but the freckles 
are mine. we're 5 up on a North Beach site 
of previous dreams. 6 he seeks his favorite tea and 
coffee dock. i'm looking 7 for a graceful awakening. 8 
at Pike Pete's an anchor hangs near 9 the entrance. 
fine dungarees, turtlenecks, tunics, 10 peajackets and ulsters abound. 11 
he's greeted by an old pal and skinnies down the 
gap 12 to get reacquainted, leaving me at sea 13 
walking south thru. the wharfside mall, 14 i intrude on 
the clubby pain of two blue-skirted 15 blue-eyed blonds. there 
are no customers 16 in their shop and their defensive 
hungry stares lance me 17 as i pass thru without 
a browse. 18 outside 19 i find myself far below 
street level. 20 there's a wall of pollution-stained steel bulkheads 
21 striped in horizontals of thick glossy red 22 and 
black enamel like a manic hulk of battleship. 23 ahead 
is a maze of metallic byways and trash-strewn 24 alleys. 
earringed and tattooed rascals in 25 leather jackets studded cutaways 
and dog collars 26 stroll and loiter, eyeballing me suspiciously 
over spliffs 27 now i step from the tub leaving 
loops and swirls of 28 desert brown Colorado clay settled 
against stark white enamel 29 exiting the train, i wait 
for Mama 30 to get her purse. she was right 
behind me 31 just a second ago. here she comes 
in 32 her polished cotton white red blue and gold 
print 33 polished cotton blouse. the Denver air 34 too 
crisp too cool. i shiver, take her hand, 35 help 
her down from the car. we've been traveling alone 36 
together for years. she has grown softer and sweeter. 37 
right now she's smiling, flush with excitement/ 38 anticipating an 
adventuresome shop 39 before the alarm sounds i'm awakened by 
faint sweepings 40 spring rain against the bush-laden side of 
the house. 41 my faded pink nylon gown rides my 
waist. my feet are ice 42 i am much smaller 
than i remember
