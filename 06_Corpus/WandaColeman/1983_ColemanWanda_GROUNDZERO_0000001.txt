1 the marauder is invisible 2 thunder of hooves against 
hard earth 3 unseen riders 4 everywhere newly orphaned children 
5 we do not know who's responsible 6 there's no 
name to name 7 no object for the finger of 
guilt 8 no bloody hands 9 everything is spotless. well 
ordered 10 not a hair out of place 11 no 
sweat 12 buttons undisturbed 13 the streets are vacant 14 
so strange this quiet war 15 so strange its respectable 
dead 16 listen. the blast is coming 17 a wingless 
dove 18 sent round the world 19 by endless greed
