seagulls dive bomb above and around Dudley Avenue

as 500 joggers appear in sweats, shorts and antlers,

duck-billed caps, and shades for the marathon on the

boardwalk, some pushing strollers, others with Walkmans,

many carrying bottles of electrolyte water. bicyclers, dreadlocks,

and pigeons abound. a pierced and tattooed couple walks

their shaggy designer pooch beyond The Cadillac Hotel.

nearby stone wolves, the gargoyles of the waterfront,

oversee the angry rhetoric and cries of “bullshit” scrawled

on stucco walls:

“America, when are you gonna change?”

“Why are you locking up all the Black children?”

up the way, there's plenty of outdoor seating at the cafes.

on the oceanside parking lot the reggae man is an ancient

darkness that emerges from his paint-splotched pastel-i-fied

trailer truck parked next to Diane's Ark, where the

puffy smog-white Teddy bear hugs its black stuffy cub

adages of “love one another,” “Jesus was homeless,” and

“Spirit of Venice” tell her story in part if she never blooms

onto the asphalt

no one here seems to know that the sixties have been over for

nearly two score, not to mention the fifties

but then,

this is Venice Beach, west

where paisley, peace signs and promise still prosper
