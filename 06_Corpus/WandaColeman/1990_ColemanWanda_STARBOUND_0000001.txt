1 she walks up astrological stairs 2 her future, she 
says, is out there 3 and starbound, 4 gazes at 
pin pricks, hoping 5 her hand extended to me---will i 
follow? 6 aunt snooky had been dead 7 three days 
before they found 8 the body 9 she had run 
away from her husband 10 had run into the streets 
11 no telling what had happened 12 had gotten a 
bad horoscope that 13 morning ... 14 pausing, the star 
in the phone 15 glimmers 16 a scorpion reclines on 
my sofa 17 shakes its stinger at me 18 we 
look like brother and sister 19 somehow i don't feel 
as deadly 20 aunt snooky boiled water on 21 the 
stove 22 angry, she couldn't have any children 23 a 
barren black woman 24 positively unheard of---his ex-wife 25 had 
his children--- 26 she boiled water and thought about 27 
her womb 28 taurus has paid me a visit twice 
29 and each time he asks me to marry him 
30 and both times i said yes and we got 
married 31 and the relationship became difficult 32 for me 
33 but taurus says he loves me so i guess 
i'd better 34 accept it, his is the only game 
in town 35 don't remember the funeral 36 my last 
memory of her was the 37 time me and taurus 
went over to 38 mom's and she was there 39 
she took his hand and put it on 40 her 
huge tits 41 "feel my heart" she said, 42 "it's 
stopped" 43 walking up the astrological stairs 44 suns and 
moons behind pale curtains 45 eyes and lips of a 
woman who kissed me once 46 bejeweled black fingers, nightmare 
of womanchild 47 taurus opens one eye curiously 48 "is 
there something wrong?" 49 "feel my heart," i answer, "i 
think it's stopped"
