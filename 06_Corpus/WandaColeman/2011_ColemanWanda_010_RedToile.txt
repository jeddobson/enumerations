when he grew up he fell

in love with a red toile curtain.

it had nothing to do with the

usual meanings of red, but with

the light of summer sunrises

and the aromas of breakfast from the

kitchen where mother hummed

red became the choice when it

came to crayons and exotic bits of

schoolroom chalk, wagons, and

two-wheelers, and go-carts

he dreamed of a fire-engine red thunderbird

he found himself drawn to snippy girls

with red under their blackness, high bras,

thick waists and thighs, girls who turned

the lights red when they stepped into

a brightness, women whose lips parted

to reveal redness as lickable as a lollipop

at times he dared secretly wrap himself in a red silk robe

the body of red led him to choose

abstract art as a pastime, in which the

worlds he created wheezed, writhed, and

burped impossible shades

red were the wheat fields of his visions

red were the darknesses of thought

red, a sheet of India ink washing over white

bleeding into flesh, his bereddened heart

redâ€”red violet red lover red stone

when he finished growing up

he wasted no time.

he married a brightness

and made ragings by morning sun
