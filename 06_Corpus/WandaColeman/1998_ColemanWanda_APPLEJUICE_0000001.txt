1 dis am da boogerscape where electronic frankensteins 2 tear 
out assumptions follicle by follicle 3 where throngs of pretenders 
loot behinds for 4 madnesses too large to carry home 
alone 5 where chronic wigglers can be found stuck in 
keyholes 6 and dogmatic daydreamers haunt devastation row 7 dis 
am da my-tongue-done-broke center of wastebasket culture 8 where the 
sucky feed on self-butchered corpses of na√Øfs 9 & cold 
leather appetizers between gibsons 10 Wagner overdubs the screams 11 
dis am da soul of soullessness 12 where the savagely 
apathetic devour turds 13 laid by the sanctified to stimulate 
their sphincters 14 where professional bleeders spill nothing if not 
for profit 15 god money blunts the horror 16 god 
money dulls the cancer 17 god money makes halves whole 
18 god money fucks you as good as 19 dis 
am da bleeding ground of lounge lizards 20 east on 
Houston west of Park 21 where graffiti is poetry 22 
poetry a preoccupation with walls 23 o phoo-phoo 24 the 
heart is a tourist who can't get a cab
