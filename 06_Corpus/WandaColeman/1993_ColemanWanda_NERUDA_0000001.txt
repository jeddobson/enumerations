1 few quiet hours 2 i spend them soaking in 
the tub with my neruda 3 in a dream a 
bearded moreno stranger 4 approaches me along a dark street 
in the plaza 5 as we pass he whispers hoarsely, 
"neruda" 6 on sunset boulevard a beggar accosts me 7 
for spare change. i hand him my collected neruda 8 
while my lover takes siesta i walk down to 9 
the neighborhood bar for a game of pool solo. i 
order 10 dos besos. i put a quarter in the 
juke and notice 11 all selections read neruda 12 while 
standing at the supermarket checkout stand 13 i read tabloid 
headlines. one screams 14 "man force-feeds wife neruda" 15 (he 
tells me he is worried neruda is coming between us)
