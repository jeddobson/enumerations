“taste your food before

you salt it,” Mama snapped

from the kitchen doorway

where she stood at the stove

at the dining room table her

starving brood surrounded their plates,

having just rushed in from playing

baseball, dodge ball, hide-and-seek,

and jacks with neighbor kids

the saltiness of our youth rolled

from our thick scalps, along slender

glistening arms and down our backs,

wetting and staining our T-shirts

one by one, spoons in left hands, we

reached for the shaker with our rights as

it passed hand-to-hand while grace

was hastily said then jokes were cracked

while snow-white crystals melted into

homemade goodness. no sooner

was a fresh platter or steamy bowl

set before us than the salt resumed

rotations

to settle into the flesh of our futures

encouraging the urge to have and eat more

and we were unmindful of the excess or

the damages to come

while Mama forever warned from

the kitchen, “Put that shaker down!”
