long sleeves by day, gloves by night

a devil dwelt in the crooks of my arms

transformed them into weeping bleeding earth

eczema left me sensitive to touch

scalp to neck, armpits to navel,

behind my knees i was bothered at their bend

citrus and wool made their marks

as did dogs and cats at play

night twitch/a blowtorch crawls my skin

contact dermatitis—rashes, scales, and sores

(what's mashable, what's not)

eyes watery with hay fever in the spring

as i sneezed off my head,

swellings on lips and eyelids filled with the pus

of a curse at birth/eternal

hours spent festering in hospital waiting room

chairs beneath the

phosphorescence/my parents praying for cure

it's not contagious but no one comes near

nicks and scratches and scars—the Mojave

resided in my flesh, compounded solitude,

deprived me of unfettered thought and friends

gradually

i learned the exorcism of lotions

and the alchemy of care/

the transformation of flame and sweat

gradually and gratefully
