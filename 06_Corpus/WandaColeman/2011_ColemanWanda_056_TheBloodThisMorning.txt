god i smell tea fresh-brewed this morning

Jasmine, Lavender, and Assam prepared by my

strangely small dark hands with ruined nails

a ritual for daily struggles begun anew

allowing its vigors to flow inward, to inspire

a breakfast of multivitamins and prunes

to wash the toxins from my system my soul

god i smell the earth on morning

damp under my brick-brown feet as i hose

the lawn quickly, thoroughly, and too, the fallen bush

of mistletoe, sprigs of clover and stingy weed

struggling for sun, double rainbows riding the spray

and prayers “to succeed” in the devilish quest ahead

to salvage what survives this uncelebrated war

god i smell mold salt pigeon droppings

weak sun breaks cloud & gulls/emerges full gold

twinning arcs in my bleak eyes, illuminating

exhaustive grapplings with chimeras shadowing

a generation's effort, my arms struggle-drunk

as mad rays draw off strength, blister the graspable,

redefine the sweat collecting under my nylon robe

god i smell the blood flow this hereafter

molasses-thick and menstrual, expelling its

sanguine metaphors onto my groin and thighs,

daring a fourth birth/to nurture to lullaby

to raise to renew the heavy-hipped battle that

goes with being mother-father keeper-giver

doctor-nurse lover-leaver savior-slayer

earthly libations of tea salt water and blood

wounds cries silences

on morning's air amid the stinks of all-possible glories

my nose forever open my hope forever June
