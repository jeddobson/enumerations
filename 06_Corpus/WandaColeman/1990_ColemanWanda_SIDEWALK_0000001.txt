1 initials, footprints 2 whenever i arrive you're there waiting 
3 stretched to greet me---hard firm familiar 4 how many 
times i've broken my mother's back in childish 5 game 
received a wadded welcome 6 of unwanted bubble gum 7 
i've always liked you 8 against my ass on cool 
summer evenings 9 still full of sun/warm and fun to 
lie on and listen 10 to the distant thundering hooves 
of steel buffalo 11 barefoot is how i love to 
receive you on cold icy mornings 12 you harbor a 
newspaper, a feast of bread crumbs for 13 pigeons or 
crushed and dying roses 14 glistening dew drops 15 sometimes 
the face you wear is that of an old white 
woman 16 gray cracked withered, chock full of arrogance and 
17 abuse---stories i will never hear 18 times when you 
rear up and buckle in protest 19 strewn with glass 
and blood---testimony to crime 20 stains that persist 21 i 
have run down you to escape 22 listened to the 
slap of my feet in flight and later 23 laughed 
to find pebbles and bits of glass embedded 24 in 
callus/i am ready for you 25 there are dark metropolises 
where you dominate 26 reign omnipotent amid masses of crawling 
steel concrete 27 brick final and endless as death. 28 
where the poor, old, blacks, yellows and browns 29 roast 
in the steam of your summer, freeze in the 30 
unmerciful snow 31 of your winter---lapse into lives gray as 
your yawning 32 distance 33 i've been few places where 
you're yet to be 34 it seems you go on 
forever 35 will be here long after the city shuts 
down 36 and then i discover you bent and cracked 
by hungry roots 37 pierced by colonies of ants 38 
broken under the pressure of high-heeled shoes 39 pot-holed by 
the rush of rain water from gutters overflowed
