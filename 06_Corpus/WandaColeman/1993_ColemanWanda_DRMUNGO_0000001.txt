1 poet to poet a rage score 2 caught between 
chiliast & nirvana 3 today i heard your haunted echo 
enticing me 4 beyond the confines of this cement cubicle 
5 slicing thru my frantic reordering of 6 assigned madnesses 
hoping i won't be fingered 7 scheming an evasion 8 
your name came sudden to sear my eyes 9 jumped 
up at me from the page a line running boldly 
10 thru it 11 have you gone to join tanabe 
on his sojourn 12 to Tibet? are you afloat in 
the cosmic 13 garbage of homeless indigents? are you on 
hold 14 in the barred penal tanks of Christ-like 15 
solitude? is your mythic presence entombed in 16 cryptic spoons 
of skagg or blow? 17 or do you do sweet 
lady who has ultimately done you? 18 you crossed my 
mind today, Doc Mungo. i 19 heard the hasty shuffle 
of your stagger 20 and am returning the call
