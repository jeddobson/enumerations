the educated get away with

crimes better than the undereducated

stay out of the alphabet if you don't know how to

play Scrabble. as for Monopoly, minus a trust fund

and attorney, jail is a permanent affair. and Negro

please be out of Park Place by sundown

the nature of a J.A.P. as in not Japanese

“at least date a potential suicide

to assess the relationship potential”

“the men who cry with you tend to run”

in her bedroom she opened the

closet to reveal asp-like snakes

whips coiled and braided, awaiting

the game of manflesh, rubber

members, breakaway handcuffs,

the stuff of fantasy and fetish

feathered ticklers, studded collars

“it's all about pain. some men thrive on pain.”

the idle rich enjoy idleness

a woman who seduces a husband away from his wife

earns whatever occurs in the process

breaking the bonds of sex preference

often comes down to a contest of wills

it's not who you know, but who wants to know you

integrity will get you nowhere

being fuckable is the best revenge

cocaine is thicker than friendship

write till you drop
