he reads me like Edgar Allen Poe at 2 p.m.,

turns me ever so—slowly, his hands irascible ravens

cawing soul-deep at the left breast, then the right

and i am all with pearl and ruby glowing …

he quotes the darkness as he travels the night from

tailbone to inner thighs, his restless fluttering like

sonorous bells heard “in the icy air of night.” eyes

like pendulums loom above me, dare my glance

frozen on that countenance half devilish, half drear.

here, in his kingdom of hauntings where he dabbles

in phantoms and laborious swirls—and not far from here

the sea, the sea … distant song of summer tide … oh, the sea …

“what,” i ask “is my fate?” and his silence blisters

the sheets and sills. here i have lain and here i'm to remain

trapped in and chained to this chambered and vaulted heart
