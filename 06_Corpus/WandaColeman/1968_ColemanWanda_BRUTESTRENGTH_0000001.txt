1 last night blonde spitfire Angie Dickinson beat steel-eyed 2 
Lee Marvin's impervious chest until she dropped to gangland's 3 
floor exhausted point blank 4 aunt ora used to threaten 
us kids with whippings 5 if half bad, she used 
her hand 6 if real bad, we got the hard 
wood paddle 7 if monstrous, there was the horsewhip that 
hung above the 8 door 9 in the den. one 
day my brother and i were half bad 10 she 
gave me the glad hand and i cried 11 she 
laid it to him and he laughed. so she got 
the paddle 12 and he laughed even harder 13 in 
consternation she abandoned his punishment 14 he was more daring 
after that 15 and then there was my geechie lover 
16 i once went at him with a 2×4 as 
hard as i could 17 i clubbed his chest. he 
smiled at me 18 i dropped the 2×4 and ran 
19 my first husband wasn't much. i could take 20 
his best punch
