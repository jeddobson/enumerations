the age of the innerview dawns and the need

to be first is muted by a

multitude of passings/desire honed so sharp

the edges bleed, lips and hands

assume a silent patience/at rest as a savage

brilliance is reborn in this ancient ravaged griot

who am i? what am i? are no longer important questions.

knowing that i am is finally enough

like discovering dessert is delicious following a disastrous

meal, a sweetness that reawakens

the palate, or finding that one's chalice is unexpectedly

filled with elixir of euphoria

and i stumble happily into the cornucopia, arms

outstretched, upturned, drunk

my heart athrum, bones full samba. the night

blesses me with his constellations

baptizes me with his deathless autumnal chill

and i invade the moody indigo

full-throated and singing
