1 you're too old to cherish that 33 rpm vinyl 
LP Pop 2 brought home from RCA Victor years ago 
without being 3 embarrassed so you use baby brother and 
sister 4 as excuses to sing along to the lyrics 
that are 5 becoming metaphors for your life. your favorite 
is 6 the cut where Danny Kaye sings about the 
ugly duckling and 7 you feel as if somehow he 
knows. and your favorite ballet 8 is Swan Lake because 
you know you are a secret swan 9 and not 
some damned Daffy. and when the other birds in so 
10 many words quack, "the worst around," you know that 
when they 11 check out your grown-up swan plumage, the 
tune will change. 12 but when you try to explain 
this to your new friend, Janet, 13 who's even bigger 
and blacker than you, she smirks while you 14 chirp 
the ugly duckling song in your best soprano, frowning 15 
as if you've actually sprouted eider down and feathers. "oh," 
16 she snorts and laughs, "we don't listen to that 
kind 17 of music. that's strictly for paddies"
