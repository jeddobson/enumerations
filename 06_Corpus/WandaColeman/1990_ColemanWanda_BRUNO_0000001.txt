1 washing six-month's worth of dirt & the devil off 
2 the old car 3 is cheap stress therapy 4 
the front window on the passenger's side 5 was shattered 
by a vandal 6 twice this year 7 the first 
time we had the money to get it 8 replaced. 
the second 9 time we didn't 10 we keep it 
parked across the street in front of 11 the movie 
studio 12 sound stage 13 it's a 1968 Buick Skylark 
we bought together but 14 it belongs to me 15 
it was towed away once. we had to cough up 
a 16 few hundred to 17 cover tow fees 18 
delinquent registration and a ticket gone to warrant 19 what's 
she doin" drivin" a rogue's car? 20 it used to 
have a stylish vinyl top which has 21 cracked and 
22 peeled off 23 when driving the jagged edges make 
a strange 24 flapping noise like 25 retreads about to 
blow 26 what's left of the paint job suggests metallic 
green 27 now it's primer gray 28 cracked and blistered 
29 dented in spots 30 the tires have been borderline 
flats for some time 31 we're careful never 32 to 
drive it unless 33 absolutely necessary. the transmission has a 
leak 34 it needs fluid 35 every 7-10 days 36 
the rear brakes are shot, the radio/tape player defunct 37 
altho the black leather 38 interior is still nice 39 
if dusty and worn at the rear window deck & 
speakers 40 i maintain it minimally until the day when 
we can 41 afford to either 42 restore or replace 
it 43 i wonder how long it'll be before it's 
stranded 44 in an intersection 45 and has to be 
junked 46 like my raggedy hand-to-mouth
