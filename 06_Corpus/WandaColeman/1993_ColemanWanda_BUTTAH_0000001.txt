1 endless wobbles 2 when seen rear-view we sistuhs 3 
who got the cadillac walk 4 frequently stop traffic 5 
my gift from my mother sits awkwardly 6 on father's 
frame 7 weights me down when i walk 8 quick 
steps take maximum effort 9 throw off my center of 
gravity 10 running the definitive chore 11 many have experienced 
this 12 ultimate wiggle/have happily disappeared 13 into like convolutions 
of 14 hot american rum and bitter-sweet 15 african rhythm 
16 many 17 and many have been reborn of it
