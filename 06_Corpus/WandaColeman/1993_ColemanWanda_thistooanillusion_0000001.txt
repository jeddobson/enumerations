i see it the way i smell it 3 the 
way it tastes. how it feels vis-a-vis newsprint 4 lately 
i've noticed i frighten blonde children when they 5 come

7 irked that such an issue should disturb 8 a 
leisurely afternoon's shop 9 (baby it's you at my heart

my nuclear bomb site) 12 happiness relative to roach-butt and 
time to burn 13 juke me 14 juke me 15 
juke me till we come music 16 you can never 
tell can never tell how never tell how sweet 17 
tell how 18 sweet how sweet a woman is sweet 
a woman is 19 by how she looks 20 lately 
i am given to speaking in tongues and 21 long 
inland lapses
