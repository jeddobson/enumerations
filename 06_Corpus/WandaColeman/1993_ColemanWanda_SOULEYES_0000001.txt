1 1 like twin hearts beating in amber 2 (flesh) 
the smoke of a caress rising and 3 risings/like soaring 
his entering my secret 4 solitude where night fighters prowl 
the terrain 5 like oboes tickling my ears drawing me 
into 6 reverie the lingering tingle of his stubble to 
7 my cheek loving the mist reminiscent of his 8 
recent evaporation like cool desert sand sifting 9 thru my 
toes his skin again taunting/begs 10 me for enfoldment/seducing me 
into amnesia 11 like hands softly rhythming on gone congas 
12 summoning groin pulsations/lifting me 13 by invisible tongues beyond 
fear latitudes 14 like sent like received
