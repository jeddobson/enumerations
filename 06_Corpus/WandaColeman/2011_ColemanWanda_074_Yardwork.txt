mock adobe clay

the wind is licking my heart

high desert heat stoke

with a swing from left to right, i wield the broom

sweep up the granulations of the remainder of the roof

of the fixer-upper no one could afford to fix up

solid green dumpsters

living without oxygen

closer to the sun

bits of cellophane wrappers and cigarette filter tips

hop into the dust pan, settle amid leaves

some green some brown some spider-webbed

music and movies

hardcore iconoclast hell

half blind by moonlight

as i swing i contemplate this bungled life and how far

i have spun without going very far at all then i slip

into daydreams of havings and leavings and lovings

lime taurine ginko

digging a hole back to France

mint floss and mouthwash

only to return coughing to daddy longlegs and the dust

its tenacious fine-powdered silt escaping the broom

riding the air doorward, toward the decaying house

where i will resume my chase with a rag

mock adobe clay

high-desert heat. stoke.

my heart is licking the wind

but in this moment, i continue my heft and swing

left to right, left to right—the granulations

of old dreams—my heavy dark arms

heavier, darker
