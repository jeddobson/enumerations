me watching, careful 4 the front and back 5 sweating 
behind r&b at the steering wheel 6 the dog 7 
saw it standing there 8 about a mile up 9 
cars/sudden slowing to keep 10 from hitting the dog 11 
that threatened to 12 go out on the freeway 13 
i slowed up with the flow 14 as i passed, 
it moved 15 toward me 16 i honked my horn 
17 it went back, then 18 i watched to see 
what would happen 19 in the rear view mirror 20 
it just walked out there 21 in front of the 
black buick 22 its body fell into a tumble 23 
under impact 24 its flesh tore red and open 25 
then another car hit it 26 and another and another
