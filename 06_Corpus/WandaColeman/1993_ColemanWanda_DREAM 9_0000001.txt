1 i am in my father's house 2 it is 
made entirely of fine cedar, unfurnished 3 the floors fairly 
clean but in corners 4 dust and bits of stuff 
indicate 5 premises vacated mere hours before 6 i go 
upstairs to the second floor and stand 7 mid-room. it 
is large with high ceiling 8 suddenly i see a 
movement 9 something rolls or crawls across the floor 10 
set in a golden glow 11 at first look it 
is a scarab. no. a gold coin 12 i go 
down on hands and knees. closer it is one of 
13 Pop's old roller erasers the kind mounted on a 
miniature 14 whisk to brush away the tiny pilings. it's 
gold instead of 15 the gray i remember as a 
child. even the dried 16 rubber cement which cakes it 
is gold 17 but as it rolls 18 the pilings 
form a giant cursive "G" then 19 it rolls towards 
me. and with it comes a cold 20 i let 
the cold come over me expecting it to pass 21 
but it lingers and the eraser spins mid-floor as 22 
i feel myself taken into extreme cold bone cold then 
23 deeper. and i know 24 and i tell myself 
smartly 25 "you'd better wake up" 26 i do so 
at once
