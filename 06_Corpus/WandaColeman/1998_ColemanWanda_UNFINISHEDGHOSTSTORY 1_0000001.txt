1 he knows my body 2 lights out & instantly 
we jump twenty years of time 3 to spar from 
the back seat of Mama's maroon '64 Ambassador 4 sedan, 
and i see my loveliness snared and twisted in his 
5 wide black confident voids. he caught a hitch into 
Southtown 6 from 'Frisco following the compulsion of my flesh 
and fondling 7 to wrap tongues in rage around the 
blade of his 8 partner's presaged demise-by-stabbings at so tender 
an age. 9 mellow is the term of our truce 
and i'm drawn to his music 10 he knows my 
body 11 nevertheless i'm upset that he's put the spook 
on me 12 serving me wrong now that my new 
jealous lover 13 has finally curbed and cuffed all suspicions 
and placed 14 his watchdog under lockdown 15 i know 
his body 16 and the lust for salt teases me 
into discomfort 17 as vengeful memories return, (ohbabethegoodsexbetweenus. 18 ohbabethegoodsex.ohbabe) 
like the test site of 19 his niggerness/the only patch 
on his body where his 20 mahogany hairline reveals a 
natural kink and inherent boogie 21 he knows what i 
liked of his body 22 "yeah," i say it soft, 
"Johnny bought it 23 up on Ivar. some puta set 
him up." 24 those huge black voids moist along the 
ridges, draw me in 25 "i'm dead tooooo," he whispers, 
thinning to a dread 26 "good," i say in self-defense, 
"too bad 27 I didn't kill you myself."
