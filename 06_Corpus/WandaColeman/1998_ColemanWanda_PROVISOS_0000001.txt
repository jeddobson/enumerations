1 hit it three licks and 2 one for spit 
3 with mother, 4 it's another problem 5 in the 
closed heart, 6 no greatness enters or leaves 7 in 
the house of the governors, 8 a servant's guile 9 
evil lives in the mirror 10 and sees none 11 
but itself, sings its own anthem 12 hears no complaint 
13 but its own 14 expertise without expression 15 damn 
genius 16 the hands of the washer are clean 17 
better one fist raised in rage 18 than a hundred 
19 pounding one's head 20 the watchdog who sleeps, sleeps 
21 when the book is closed 22 the words starve 
23 when the soul rises, the river carries bones 24 
look at its teeth, if you must 25 it is 
safer 26 than mounting for the ride
