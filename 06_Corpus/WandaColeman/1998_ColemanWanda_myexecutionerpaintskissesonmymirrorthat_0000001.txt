1 my executioner paints kisses on my mirror. that 2 
master peckerwood of death's architecture unveils a 3 new work 
of art. i wonder, is my lover bothered by 4 
my absence in some sublime way? or does he 5 
plunge, ironic and deadpan, thru the labia majora 6 of 
another? the teary-eyed hurt child has become the 7 bleary-eyed 
madam, the two linked only by the most 8 tremulous 
thread of snot---an umbilical cord crudely cut 9 minutes ago 
and without anesthesia. have you noticed? the 10 protruding brown 
navel resembles a big toe and kicks 11 accusingly at 
the guilty air. my executioner rends me 12 from a 
meticulously planned glory, my elegiac dream 13 disrupted as i'm 
roused, blessed and led from this cell. 14 who, now, 
will sing my praisesong?
