i dance the snake—a tortuous samba

bramble-haired, wine-eyed, skin seared

wailing against the cave against the tower

stinking of poverty, of burnt rubber and water-based

paint, patchouli oil and sage, gasoline and auto

exhaust, stinking to high hell

all verticals within the horizontals, ventricles

overworked. called Quasheba but lived life without

Sundays—a severity of tongues, a raw vernacular

the freight of jealousies a cloak of hornets, on my way

nowhere, voiceless, unheard, yet seeking redress

glide under glide the sweet spring sun forgotten

gods cavorting the thought horizon, recreating the moon full-splendor

heartbeats, slumber's depths—the music of moans

swells of air/eternity unraveling becoming the length of time

it takes to capture his attention. at ecstasy's gate

i am the fat woman scratching her breast in public, arm—heavy

like a tired swimmer, yet stitching together my garment

of sunlight and sand/crossing the ninth boundary

to a field of white crosses, salvation defied

in last night's dream i searched the bed sheets

and one-by-one removed the slender knives from

the folds, those lovely long thin knives with serrated blades

he places himself beneath me that i may grasp and climb

his body—first the altar then prey then the offering—

as i am transformed, from calm to cunning,

from logy to lusty, from wife to wanton/our ritual before

couplings as we snake and coil, one across the other

skin against skin, flame into flame

and the dark shineth in the light

and the lightness comprehended it not
