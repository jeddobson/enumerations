1 but sun was electric bright in the razzling blue 
2 Southern California sky 3 Kika and i were leaving 
Childrens Hospital up on 4 Sunset Boulevard 5 we were 
both spaced-out by our visit---emotionally whipped 6 we had been 
to see the daughter of a friend---a young white 7 
working mother who had been forced to give up her 
job and 8 go on county welfare rolls in order 
to care for 9 her ailing child 10 the child 
had come down with a rare and mysterious virus 11 
it had come on like the flu but had left 
the child paralyzed 12 waist down---a paraplegic. the doctors had 
just gotten 13 the final diagnoses. we looked on from 
a supportive distance 14 as they informed the mother her 
child would never 15 walk again 16 there were a 
lot of hugs. a lot of tears 17 we spent 
a couple of hours in empathetic agony offering as 18 
much courage to the mother and child as two so-called 
strong 19 black women could muster 20 exhausted, we left 
the hospital. as we approached the 21 intersection 22 a 
van full of young white males sped past. leaning out 
the 23 window on the driver's side they yelled at 
us 24 "niggers!" 25 "did you hear those sonsabitches!" i 
screeched as my head split 26 "i don't even want 
to deal with it," Kika snapped and quickly 27 lit 
a cigarette 28 sizzling in the fierce brilliance we dizzily 
made our way to the 29 car
