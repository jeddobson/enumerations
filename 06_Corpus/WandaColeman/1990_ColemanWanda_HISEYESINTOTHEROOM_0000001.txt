1 shattering silence a gun full of bullets 2 this 
one for you, this one for your lover, this one 
for me 3 click click in the chamber---jealousy high 4 
humbuggering ain't out of fashion. evolution will never 5 make 
this animal extinct. it's in the soil, air, radiates 6 
down from the sun 7 his hand pretty heavy metal 
against my temple 8 like that i'm into next week 
pushing up old friends and 9 newspaper headlines 10 a 
seance to call back dead poems 11 we can run 
it through the camera until the 12 celluloid snaps 13 
just let me hear those three little words: make mine 
money 14 a blend of cognac and cocaine 15 asking 
about his difference would make a difference 16 biting tongue 
as he shoots his ambivalence into my womb 17 thrills 
in vacant lots and bloody tin cans 18 the son-of-a-bitch 
is kicking down my door, entering the 19 room, taking 
me by the arm, slapping my face, calling 20 me 
bitch, shoving me into the sheets 21 i've played this 
scene too many times 22 i must like it
