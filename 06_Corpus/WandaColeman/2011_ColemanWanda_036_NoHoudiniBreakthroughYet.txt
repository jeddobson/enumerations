This is not going well—as ever. I mean the Tootsie Roll fingers flying

across the keyboard and doll's face cringing and the stomach sucked

in—these failed efforts to stave off a debtor's fate.

Like Houdini flinching with the blow to his gut that finds him ill-braced,

his insides about to burst through his fist-shocked midriff with an

implosion so fierce it will be felt the rest of the century and into the next.

As will linger the image of his haint-ridden wife knocking at Eternity.

Dearly betrothed, return. Let me know the hardness of your bedevilment

once more. Your arms, having held me, have made surviving your absence

as impossible as it was living with your obsessions.

This is not going well—moreso than ever, our escapades spiritless, teeth

grinding through bleak sleep and dubious wakings—magic stunted,

lessening probability of escape. Bad-sad rhythm and blues.

Wasted—the time we've spent sweating this beloved comfort only to

so rudely disappear.
