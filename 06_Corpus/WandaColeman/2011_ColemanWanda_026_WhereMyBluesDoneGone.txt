yonder down under and gone

dabbling around with and fiercely dangling

across the tracks drinking clabber with hardtack

walking on the moon in 7-League Boots

lying to my face and selling me poots

mining the past for escape to nowhere

yonder down under and gone

avoiding the truth and falling behind

throwing stones at heaven

and eating chicken-on-the-run

passing bad paper and swilling shine

hippling down Broadway

yonder down under and gone

skinning rabbit and pitching a tent

at my front door without a cent

putting snatches on patches

making monkey bread and cookin' up a mess of greens

slurping pot liquor and playing low-down kings

yonder down under and gone

lingering over a sticky yet imprecise sweetness

dancing on the edge of night, bettin' the stars

gonna fall from the sky

laughing in the mirror (ain't it a fright?)

yonder down under and gone
