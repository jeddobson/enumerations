1 he loved her on her glossy surface 2 the 
crystal blue icy cool of her kiss 3 a river 
by which he fished for hours 4 but never went 
in deep 5 never braved the rough current 6 and 
though she's seven years dead 7 he never dared know 
her 8 was why he took her dying so to 
heart 9 the townsfolk thought her trash 10 and him 
no better 11 so what if the slut could 12 
take on a whole room of men 13 with him 
bein' such a lover 14 no love enough 15 he 
couldn't see more'n sex was the cravin' 16 women want 
to be known 17 and loved in the knowin' 18 
he shut her out with complete acceptance 19 he remembers 
the details of her blue & white 20 polkadot panties 
21 her low-cut clinging yellow tiger lily dress 22 her 
pouty red come-on smile 23 how the labia of her 
rose opened and moistened 24 in the heat of his 
sun 25 but he never bothered to ask 26 what 
she dreamed in her deepest dream 27 death took her 
equally without question 28 and as quick 29 he buried 
her in a grave of his own digging in 30 
ground where they'd lain 31 as lovers on the land 
that is his down under 32 and no one will 
ever know her 33 and he's not into resurrection
