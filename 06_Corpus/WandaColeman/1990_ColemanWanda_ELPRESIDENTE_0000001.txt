let me tell you it is true i have been 
a victim. i was taken in chains to his white 
house. i saw the millions dying outside the door and 
watched as he paraded thru the streets of the dead 
seeing nothing. yes, he said there was no hunger. but 
the hungry are everywhere sleeping in doorways, on park benches, 
in abandoned autos. some are dying slowly from contamination by 
chemical or radioactive waste. some die of diseases caused by 
their livelihoods---ulcers and cancers. some die merely of benign neglect. 
yes---i saw him and the trick he did with their 
minds. he reached into a bag and poured out those 
dry brittle minds and dropped a handful of them into 
a vat of alcohol. they jumped to life as if 
alive. i almost shat on myself in fear but kept 
outwardly cool. those minds. how horrible. later i made my 
escape from the white house to the ghetto. i knew 
he'd be sending his flunkies after me---for my mind. he 
does not want the world to know what goes on 
inside these borders---how he thrives on dry and brittle minds. 
they will take my mind which is why i send 
this urgent warning to you so that you will avoid 
my impending fate and the doom of those others. no 
mind is safe from this eater of minds as long 
as we grant him power
