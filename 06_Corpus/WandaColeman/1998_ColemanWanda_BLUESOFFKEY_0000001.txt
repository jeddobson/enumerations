there would be no mistakes in the world 3 (no 
damn hurtin') 4 she filled open sun-scorched avenues 5 with 
girlish anticipation and goober dust memories 6 of him---the holes 
in his over-bleached pockets 7 his perforated soul leaking mad 
reed/to mainline the 8 music and ditch the habit 9

11 (beat bleat and unpetite) 12 swimming in the wash 
of neon and smoke 13 coronets bleeding pain neuroses riff-abundant 
14 blessed by thick ever-passionate earth-colored lips 15 there and 
thus 16 compelled to compose her tragedy. to wait to 
pine 17 to whine---knowing 18 he'd gone several lifetimes ago 
19 before leaving nothing but the bitters at the bottom 
20 of her glass and echoes of a slamming door
