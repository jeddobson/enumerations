1 has an office in beverly hills 2 where he 
is one of several arachnids who feed off the blood 
3 of kidney failures 4 he walks into the office 
with tennis shorts on, sweaty 5 and hairy and looks 
6 at me as though i'd just stepped out from 
under 7 a rock, sometimes 8 as if i'm the 
rock itself, raised to crush him/his ego 9 on occasion 
he will 10 hang two cigarettes from his lip and 
parade, because it's 11 cool like paul henreid 12 or 
malibu with the tall blonde with tits like "melons 13 
crushing my chest" beside him 14 in the front seat 
of his mercedes-benz limo looking very 15 "new york jew" 
as another blonde put it 16 he frequently comes into 
this cubby hole to ask questions 17 about his appointments 
and any 18 messages. and often i am the only 
one here. he doesn't 19 know my name and rather 
than ask it 20 he looks at me slightly perplexed 
and spins away. i will be 21 leaving this place 
soon 22 i hope. it's very depressing, coming here day 
after day 23 pounding my ass off 24 another fly 
caught in the web
