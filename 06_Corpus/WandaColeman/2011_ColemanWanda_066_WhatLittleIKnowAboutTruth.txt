1

Truth is merciless and relentless.

2

As a child I spelled it f-a-t-h-e-r.

3

The truth has a context, a region, a nation,

a history, a sociology, corporate and religious governors.

4

Daily survival demands much-needed respite in couching,

softenings, and outright lies. Often, the decent thing to do

is tell the lie.

5

Truth is often confused with honesty, which is what one gets

when the truth is used to manipulate.

6

I yelled fire in the auditorium. I was asked if I truly knew the

appropriate signs for fire, did I have fire credentials, and what

made me think I had the right to yell.

7

Truth is a commodity or unnatural resource, which, when

distorted, fuels the media and national economy as a whole.

8

It is determined by the quirks of semantics and one's ability to grasp.

9

It will not necessarily set anyone free. Too often the truth

is a prison in which the truth-teller dies anonymously.

10

Hollywood will not finance truths about racism because

they are not entertaining.

11

As a youngster I spelled it p-o-e-t-r-y.

12

Transforming fantasies and white lies into truths

may become a ruinous fulltime occupation.

13

My son was murdered by the nation of our birth, the nation we loved.

14

Truth has a physiology. It enters thru the senses, brains wired in

uncountable variations. What you cannot touch you cannot see.

15

Presenting it in public forums has not set me free.

16

Acts of heroism may rule it out.

17

In my maturity its spelling no longer matters. There are

many thousand spellings.

18

It cannot be dreamed into existence.

19

My capacity to forgive has been beaten out of me.

20

The great-winged condor

with stupendous beak and ferocious talons

is settled on my belly, rips out my flesh my soul.
