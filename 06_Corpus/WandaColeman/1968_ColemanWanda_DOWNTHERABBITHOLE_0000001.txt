1 oh i tailed her thru beverly hills her ashen 
blonde locks 2 my tar baby naps her pale silken 
face a full moon 3 my red-brown face mars her 
intelligent gray crystals my fierce 4 brown bricks her thin 
emotionless lips cloaked in a half smile 5 my thick 
taut lips parted in battle's cry her voguish figure and 
6 high-fashion boots my eternal diet and resoled wedgies she 
7 climbed 8 into a chauffeur-driven limo i bandied along 
behind in my 9 tore-down 10 coupe she whipped into 
the penthouse suite and after lunch 11 signed 12 the 
contract i cleared the dining table and collected a 13 
two-bit tip she flew to new york for the premiere 
then jetted to 14 brazil to recuperate from her migraine 
i got a job ghosting 15 reality 16 but couldn't 
earn enough to pay my entry fee into the middle 
17 class 18 childless she gathers the attention of the 
world i crawl into 19 obscurity next to my mister 
and make babies she sips 20 champagne 21 i spill 
coffee on the rug
