1 dearest cousin, 2 forgive this ruined narrative begging the 
first 3 element of creation. last time i was here 
i was here. 4 now i wonder what, exactly, are 
the components of my 5 invisible spectrum? sun-ra rising. 6 
i went for a reading of palms to rediscover 7 
disappointment. "better an almost-was," said the gypsy, 8 "than a 
never-was." her peculiar conjure left me staring at 9 my 
naked brown feet for hours. when reverie broke it was

found 11 myself old, alone sans shelter from the ever-blessed 
heat. 12 this note is sent perchance you've wondered what 
13 befell one adventuresome one solongago lost, this missive 14 
in an empty ron rico bottle set adrift on a 
sea of flute 15 music---this repetitious rendering of pain---for on 
my 16 one-palm island dwells no such beast as joy
