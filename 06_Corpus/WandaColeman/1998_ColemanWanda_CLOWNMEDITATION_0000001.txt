1 i am unsure. i go about the endless dream 
2 of grave faces. who are we? what neighborhood 3 
is this? why am i lost here? is this the 
4 intersection of last night's dream and this 5 morning's 
reality? sister, where are we? this 6 face is not 
our mother's face. whose voice 7 is that? i am 
uncertain. do i have time to know 8 him? there's 
a big black bear but no cave, no park 9 
and no half-eaten hikers. does god know where 10 i 
am and why i'm lost? is he too an uncertainty? 
11 my voice is so tiny. if i put my 
nose under 12 the blade will someone slice it off? 
can 13 there be space without boundaries?
