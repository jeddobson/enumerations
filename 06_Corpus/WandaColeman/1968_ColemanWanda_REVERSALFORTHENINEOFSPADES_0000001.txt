man 2 who will never be a man 3 that 
sets my heart on edge 4 it sets me to 
pray to the god i never believed 5 to be 
god that dwells 6 in the heaven i am lost 
to 7 will that his days be the days love 
fills 8 my labor could not provide enuff tho 9 
i love him as i love myself 10 pray that 
his years be marked by all's best 11 that has 
been denied me in the blackest black 12 of my 
blood yearn 13 crucified by the hope that he will 
one day resurrect 14 the truth the hate that defines 
me 15 my sacrifice worry pain 16 that he'll escape 
the barbed sphincter of 17 our omnivorous poverty 18 die 
old and untroubled
