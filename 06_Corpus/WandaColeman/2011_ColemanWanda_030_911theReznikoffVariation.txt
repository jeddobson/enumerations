The sky is a peculiar charcoal

with great dust clouds

fulminant and black: not luminous white cumuli

or the witchy sweep of wispy cirrus,

nayâ€”the thunderous roll of collapsing towers

with particles of flesh

droplets of blood

real cries, real terrors.

A frightened woman dressed in soot

elbows alongside other panicked runners

into the camera

tilted to capture the exploding skyline

its microphone

captures the curses and prayers of flight,

picture out of focus as photography fails
