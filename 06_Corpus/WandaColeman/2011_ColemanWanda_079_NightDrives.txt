the glare of lights was undiminished

automobile lamps versus the eyes at seventy

lights that illuminated reasons possibilities lies

sometimes he forced himself to leave the

left lanes for the right, and used the

brights himself in the pitch black stretches

his wife sat silently anxious beside him

seldom asking the questions that hung on

the air, her blood running cool then colder

the force of the lights uncontrolled, coming

at all angles, piercing millions of points

as if en masse the stars had descended to earth

he thought there was an end to the heavens

that the drive uphill then down would reveal

unexplored vistas, the world of creatures

who thrived without light, like the world in

which he had found this final wife, the one

who guarded him against that Final Light

there, before them, headlights like comets,

outside the rippled surface of the desert,

below the tires vibrating against the endless

highway, the force of rapture nothing wanted

as they prayed to escape the burning brightness

that numbed and scorched that scorched and numbed
