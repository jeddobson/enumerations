1 used to know a man who sold it hot. 
a woman who knew 2 the ins and outs of 
bad paper. an artist who kiln 3 fried ghetto pots 
and glazed eyes--- 4 a neighborhood of chances 5 the 
story starts in brown webbing of palm raised eyes 6 
in supplication. god slur drops reds, drinks schlitz malt 7 
liquor, bumps booty to the blues and swoops the 8 
asphalt after curfew, brim cocked 9 wide open for action 
10 a chronicle of hearts bleeding, minds writhing, fists 11 
pounding head. call it heads or tails (1866 or 1976) 
12 slavery drives it home into that black woman's snatch. 
13 sucks her teats---milk of generations 14 my story no 
different. brother love came up to see me, a 15 
sack of goodies and an empathetic ear. "most sistuhs 16 
who been through what you been through been dead long 
17 time ago" 18 uncaps the bottle, pours a song. 
we toast that 19 bitch, mother america 20 alone behind 
the wheel, his ghost rides with me, sips wine. 21 
"you one hell of a beautiful bitch." memory a hand 
on my 22 thigh. another of ladies who lose their 
demons on the 23 freeway chorus: 24 it's true. ain't 
no new. a different spice, the same 25 old stew. 
a different man, the same old screw. 26 crack a 
smile, laugh a while. it ain't the 27 act---it's the 
style 28 midnight carries me south down blue ave finding 
meaning 29 at the bottom of an empty cup. reading 
eyes, leery 30 not to give up too much. a 
dime 31 for the cause and thick lips pressed 32 
to the window
