i have never lost the night

candle wax. a chorus of witches on the brew

i own it, it owns me

(as i slow for security check, the ancient one who guards by day

inspects the pass on my windshield through sun-baked squints,

tells me “last night someone stole my car!”)

night things: a stippled stallion full gallop through moonless glade

the shadow arms of Joshuas raised in prayer

tumbleweed burning against the horizon

the movement of invisibles on back trails

as a child i heard it in the cry of the puma

as a mother i smelled it on the breath of my dying boy

as a lover it penetrates and sates my longings

it shapes my temperament colors my destiny

i have never lost the night. it lives under my table,

guides me through a gallery of pains, dogs my moves

as i swoop the merciless roads

i will never lose the night. it will always say

“you're beautiful”

i am it, it is me

it will always grant me the power
