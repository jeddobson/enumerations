1 no. he is not responsible for this fix 2 
i'm in even if he 3 is one of them 
and i've come to him as 4 seraphic benefactor 5 
one sympathetic to my cause if not direct 6 supporter 
of it 7 i have come to him for help 
to his grand house 8 where he lives in 9 
great comfort with his angelic family i have 10 come 
so angry 11 about the necessity to maintain shelter this 
12 urgency this 13 emergency born of my incurable skin 
condition 14 i have come to 15 request a loan 
which i will pay back somehow 16 someday if in 
17 blood as i fight back outraged tears my eyes 
my 18 heart straining 19 under great embarrassment i swallow 
my pride 20 mountains of it 21 humble myself that 
i may feed my children 22 another week or 23 
two until i can make my own luck my own 
way 24 find a piece of money 25 steal it 
if need be this melodrama my cursed 26 planetary survival 
27 my gnat's ass as precious as congolese gold 28 
my flyspeck of 29 existence as majestic as mississippi sunrise 
30 i sit and wait for 31 him in his 
garden so full of shame i think the 32 roses 
are watching 33 as minutes crawl and creep until finally 
he 34 returns to hand 35 me a palmful of 
alms. "all i can afford" 36 says the grand man 
37 in his grand eden surrounding his grand house 38 
and i accept his 39 words as gospel graciously swallowing 
my rage 40 i give my bitter 41 thanks and 
promise the pay-back. as i leave my 42 spirit shrunken 
43 so small i trip over an ant and suddenly 
the 44 sky is filled 45 with the uproarious laughter 
of roses
