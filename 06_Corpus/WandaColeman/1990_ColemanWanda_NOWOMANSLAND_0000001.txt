1 they trample on my sensitivity 2 goose-step thru streets 
of my affection 3 line me up before the firing 
squad of insecurity, shoot me 4 down 5 when the 
smoke clears 6 my corpse interred 7 they sing my 
praises in a hymn 8 love politics---a legislature of pricks 
9 they pass bogus bills of understanding 10 table my 
lusts in committee 11 refuse to acknowledge my plea for 
justice 12 before supreme court of need 13 when the 
fires die 14 they toss my ashes to the wind 
15 moan prayers 16 administrative coup---d√©tente for them, defeat for 
me 17 they demilitarize the zone of my thighs 18 
napalm my dreams of black womanhood 19 overkill my illusions 
in a pushbutton mechanized 20 fuck-session 21 when the dust 
settles 22 my hopes float face-up in the 23 river 
tears 24 martial law---immediate withdrawal? 25 no white flag of 
truce 26 no surrender
