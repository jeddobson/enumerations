1 red-faced you follow the loony white line to 2 
the blue door where the 7 a.m. wait runs fifty 
deep 3 you in your unwashed crown your snaggled teeth 
4 your aircraft-carrier hips you're snotting all 5 over America 
this bad gin morning fizzle you've just 6 run out 
of tissues so you use the flap of your grimy 
7 muumuu worn fax paper thin the truth you've tried 
8 to peddle did not feed or free you but 
has trapped 9 you in the dungeon of working ass 
poor doings 10 you fill out white forms in blue 
ink 11 twixt curses and prayers, check the red boxes 
12 the helpers you consult are underpaid automatons who 13 
smell of bureaucratic bugkill yet sniff down 14 their noses 
at you marauder your larcenous fingers 15 filching their taxes 
you tinsel thugsta robbing 16 them of phone time with 
sweethearts you pernicious 17 promiscuous sloven spreading VD, AIDS and 
black males 18 of course you're allergic to work, would 
rather 19 sleep till noon 20 watch the soaps the 
blabfests the shitcoms 21 (low self steam) 22 stand on 
street corners swiggin' grape 23 or sippin' coonshine 24 loudtalkin' 
gamblin' prostitutin' 25 blue-brained under the white 26 sheets, gasping 
to the throb warning code red 27 a clich√© with 
a skin condition as 28 seen by those spaced-out heads/those 
probing 29 amber eyes narrowed to amused slits denying your 
30 claim on the dream o purple mountains of prose 
31 charting your failures as you nut up under the 
32 thunder of blows your majesty that kinkknot on your 
33 psyche of course you're guilty of breaking illusion 34 
and 35 taking up too much sun of course you're 
guilty of 36 looting the nation's coffers of course you're 
lucky 37 to have 38 survived past thirty-five---you 39 bloodwart
