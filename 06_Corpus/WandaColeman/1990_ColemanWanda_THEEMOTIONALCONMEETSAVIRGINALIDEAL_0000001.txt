and i'm too tired 5 bearded man in long green 
trench coat stands outside liquor 6 store, stops me in 
excitement of eyes to score a hit with this 7 
tall stallion, saddle and ride her into sensual fulfilling 8 
a nightmare---the cream and she snorts vague interest 9 "someday, 
you'll look back at all 10 of this and laugh"

brown and muddy 13 you wouldn't want the dying of 
my 14 spirit on your hands 15 bearded black man

snorts contempt 21 "you're the most beautiful woman 22 i've 
ever had" 23 don't ask me what i've done 24

whinnies against cold 31 desert 32 wind blowing---he saddles up, 
pulls the rein 33 "you can seduce my body, but 
you 34 cannot seduce my mind" 35 don't ask for 
explanations 36 the words are dark, bloody 37 you wouldn't 
want to pay the price 38 of my confession
