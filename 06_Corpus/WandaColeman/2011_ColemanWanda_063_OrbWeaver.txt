deathrise caught by glinty strands

of labyrinthine web spanning

eave to rotting eave so bold

it draws the heart, the living knot

in its middle has hold of its witting

victim engorged in dark bars where it

delights in subtle tortures pryings

and pinings for remission not in

blood but in white bother, sucking

recognition from a spun-drunk core
