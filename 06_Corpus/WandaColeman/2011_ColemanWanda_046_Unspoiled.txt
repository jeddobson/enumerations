these wounds return like old lovers

shadow scars deepen to red violet

as if merely stored in the flesh beneath.

i moan loudly in this sleepwalk, burns,

stingings & welts leeched into consciousness

as familiar as mother's beatings with belts, fists,

and switches—the epithets and manglings of my name

that peculiar song sung by one enraged: would you like a spanking?

erupts in my ears, upsets my stomach

rumbles in my bones and bowels

what have i done? i asked you then as ever i ask myself

your eyes answered and answer still: you were born

you nappy-headed bitch

the child i was adores you and despairs—for all time.

but for today's mean loneliness your scion loathes you

looking at my hands, identical to yours,

i see me slapping myself—the force of blows

knocks me back, across the decades, to my knees

where i cry “Daddy!” but he is seldom home

(the spankings stopped when i turned fourteen,

when i outgrew you and began my womanly bleeds

though the slaps continued)

now i will open my hand and heart

apply salve and solace. in these final days

grant myself breath

be the mother i deserved
