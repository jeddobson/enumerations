1 day. brings the heat of success 2 i'm on 
to it and into it. he follows 3 doggedly, a 
tooth brush and a razor away 4 from reality. we 
have weathered storms 5 and made it into port battered 
but intact 6 baby when i'm high it's you 7 
clinging to my ear like a 8 big yellow tropical 
flower, you singing 9 in my womb/a chorus of trombones 
10 noon. my eyes on the clock 11 i'm all 
over it. beating it. my hands 12 pound away at 
the keys, briskly, a minute 13 away from fantasy. the 
streets below are full of 14 limos, mannequins and stars 
plated in platinum 15 baby, when you're down on me 
16 beating into my heart like a 17 big bass 
drum, you, clanging 18 in my head/the bells of los 
angeles 19 evening. my head in his arms. our light 
shines 20 here. salsa mexicali wail from the neighbor's 21 
stereo, screaming low rider's brakes. we had a rough-tough 22 
day, but made midnight on schedule
