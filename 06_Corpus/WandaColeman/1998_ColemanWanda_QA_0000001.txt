1 what do you say to the dead 2 when 
they beg your pardon after having stepped 3 on your 
sore feet 4 their eyes reflecting an unexpected moistness 5 
bones of hands tapping uneasily against 6 worm-whittled threads, rattling 
blackened silver 7 but aren't you the one they expected? 
the one who 8 will flesh them out again? 9 
the breath. the air. that future mentioned hastily 10 a 
few months before demise just outside 11 a hallway, was 
it? a door? yes, a theater---and 12 they were smiling 
into the champagne and so were you 13 what do 
you say when they urge you to hurry 14 before 
the paper, already yellowed, catches 15 mold. before their rapidly 
dimming shadows 16 become suggestions of shadow 17 hurry. before 
the sun intrudes like a brute paw 18 slicing thru 
the melancholy. 19 what do you say to the dead 
when they tug at 20 your petulant sleeve, whisper gossip, 
confess marvelous 21 lusts, drip spittle on your freshly cleaned 
jacket 22 pull out a rotted tooth with its gold 
crown and lay 23 the treasure in your palm, extracting 
promise as if prayer 24 "soon," is what you say 
when you can't say. soon
