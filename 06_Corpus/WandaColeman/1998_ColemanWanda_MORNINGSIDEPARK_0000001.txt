1 it is father's day. i go to visit Pop 
2 off cherry blossom lane 3 where the grass is 
dry. near the back wall 4 among recent graves. i 
see television antennae 5 and the roofs of garages. i 
hear 6 the playful noise of children. the cadence 7 
of cars on the thoroughfare. planes 8 landing at the 
airport. there is no marker 9 but a small white 
card protected in 10 see-thru plastic trimmed in green. his 
name 11 is typed on it and his date 12 
of death. i am angry because i can't 13 afford 
to buy him a stone to equal 14 the weight 
of my love
