1 ball-and-jack 2 a laugh so loud certain people 3 
turn to stare 4 the rhythm and blues of thick 
lips locked tight 5 grinding home minutes to curfew 6 
ass as wide as it is high 7 after a 
hard night's sex the nappy flow of 8 hair gone 
back to it 9 the song sung in a tub 
of dirty water 10 churchified sistuh strut with big fancy 
Sunday hats 11 workin' those stilettos 12 before Suez 13 
the shadow of a shadow casting shade 14 on my 
bones
