1 no one asks after me 2 someone vaguely recalls 
a funeral 3 but no one can locate the grave 
4 perhaps that was five hundred years ago 5 perhaps 
five days 6 how is it that the old house, 
7 so filled with nostalgia, 8 is so empty of 
warmth, the broken 9 bones of shutters splintering pale cool 
sun 10 what chance for happiness, here, in this second 
life 11 caught between the essence and the imitation 12 
yet here and there, a fluttering 13 as perceptible as 
the movement of the hour hand 14 (they say it 
must be hard 15 and i declare it thirty effing 
years hard) 16 what was bitter has become strange sugar 
17 what could not be heard, a symphony of enchantments 
18 what could not be seen, inflames 19 what was 
shadow is fever's form 20 is this memory or destiny? 
21 i would touch the wood and stir the dust 
22 but my black arms are made of stone and 
do not answer 23 still, i drink the ether and 
grow jubilant 24 become a light and cast myself 25 
across the sorrow 26 into this lean and lonely shade
