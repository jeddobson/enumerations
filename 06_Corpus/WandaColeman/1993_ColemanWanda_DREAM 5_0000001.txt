1 in terror i wake but can't rise 2 the 
long dark is filled with fierce shallow wind. 3 i'm 
in our bedroom, its glut of books, the ceiling fan, 
4 the white levelor blinds, the faint pungency of scented 
5 candle wax. i am sprawled on the bed (yet 
the floor) 6 and feel a warm wetness oozing into 
my groin. 7 alerted, i know someone else is in 
here. he's finished. 8 he's turned to go. i see 
his assassin's back. i know 9 he conceals the beretta. 
there's a thin gray cowl 10 cloaking his head. he 
wears black slacks and a salmon 11 pink-on-black silk paisley 
shirt which ripples against 12 the ess of his back 
in the shrill wind. i know his back. i 13 
think to cry out a warning to my lover but 
realize 14 i'm weighted to the floor (now the bed) 
beneath his body. 15 there's a bullet in his head 
at the temple and a bullet 16 has pierced his 
upper torso beneath his heart. he lies 17 across my 
chest, bearded mouth slack and open. i hear 18 the 
yowl of wind. i remember how death felt in the 
19 cold hand of my father. but if we've been 
murdered 20 in bed (yet here on the floor) aren't 
i dead also? 21 then how do i think? 22 
abruptly i re-awake to discover 23 someone has tiptoed into 
the room and has clicked off 24 the television set
