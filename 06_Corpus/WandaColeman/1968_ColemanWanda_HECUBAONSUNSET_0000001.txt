1 i step into the bus into her eyes 2 
the spiritualist gives me the hi sign 3 at gower 
we watch the escapee dervish 4 whirl by in a 
mickey mouse t-shirt, black designer jeans 5 and a green 
baseball cap 6 she talks at me hard fast 7 
there's little time, much to say 8 "have you had 
the dream?" 9 "what dream?" i ask 10 "have you 
dreamed of water?" 11 "sure" 12 at western the white 
woman in slacks 13 & white halter comes out of 
them 14 in mid-traffic 15 "have you dreamed of the 
wave? 16 a wave of water?" 17 "oh yeah, i've 
had dreams like that lots" 18 "more frequent lately?" 19 
"i guess," i try to humor her 20 the cosmic 
lady abandons the-other-end 21 for haight-ashbury 22 "it's going to 
happen within 20 years," she confides 23 "there will be 
a wave of water 24 it will drown this nation. 
no one will be able 25 to stop it," she 
points to the sky prophetically 26 my stop arrives and 
i exit quick 27 glad to get away from her 
twitchery 28 at vermont tiresias jogs past 29 in short 
shorts and a walkman 30 the bees are hummin' the 
birds are buzzin' 31 and the smog is smoggin' 32 
i repress my bladder---the urge to start a deluge 33 
and hurry on
