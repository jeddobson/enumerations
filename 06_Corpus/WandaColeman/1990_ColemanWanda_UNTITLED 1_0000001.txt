1 she was the perfect woman 2 until he discovered 
she had a mania for flesh 3 he'd come in 
late at night. she'd be gnawing away at it 4 
under the covers 5 she kept jars of it in 
the medicine cabinet 6 and when she kept telling him 
she had a headache 7 he would lay there looking 
up at the ceiling, knowing what 8 she was really 
doing 9 sometimes she'd snatch a bite in public 10 
one day they were visiting mutual friends 11 she dropped 
her purse, it fell open. all that red 12 bloody 
black flesh on the carpet. it was embarrassing 13 so 
that night he decided to tell her that it was 
no good 14 over, finished 15 and as he mounted 
the dark stairwell leading to her living 16 quarters he 
hesitated. but no, he thought. she loves me 17 she 
had crouched behind the door, and as he walked past

meat in the drawer by her 20 typewriter. she put 
some chunks of it in 21 the bowl by the 
bed stand so she could 22 munch on it while 
she watched tv 23 she wrapped the rest of it 
carefully in tin foil 24 and stuck it in the 
freezer 25 looking into the mirror she let out something 
like a bark 26 well, she thought, i never lie 
to them. i always tell them 27 what i am. 
they never believe me
