Over skunk, laughter and dago red, me and Kika were 
jaw- ing with Crystal, the 6 foot, 4 inch caucasian 
transsexual dope dealer. His three hundred and fifty pounds were 
hugged up on the couch next to his skinny, redneck, 
teenaged runaway lover. We were digging on a sitcom and 
during the commercial breaks, listening to Crystal fill us in 
on his sex change operation and how wonderful it feels 
to have a brand new pussy. The sitcom blipped off 
and we were stunned by the rude vision of bony 
African children bent by vitamin deficiencies and social upheavals as 
their sphinx-eyed mothers with grotesque, juiceless, leathery breasts attempted to 
nurse husks of babies. Crystal started the bad mouth. "This 
looks like Commie propaganda. Look at the women. How come 
the women don't look so bad. They look fat and 
healthy to me. Somebody's eatin'," he crowed. "These bleeding heart 
Christians are a crock of shit." "It's the diet," I 
offered lamely, "you can see the same phenomenon in any 
urban or rural ghetto right here in the U.S." "The 
diet?" he laughed. "They're dyin' to eat." His lover joined 
him in a chorus of belly-shakes. Kika and I stiffened. 
We are as black as those African mothers and fat 
has begun to nest around our hips and thighs in 
like fashion. I tap Kika's wrist and we split, Kika 
quick on the phony excuse. "They don't understand the genetic 
dynamics involved," I bled into her ear as I bogarted 
the car through heavy after- noon traffic. I was going 
up in steam. "How our bodies retain mass under threat 
of famine. How the ability to retain fat is vital 
to tribal survival. How it helped us get through slavery." 
"So that's why it's nearly impossible to starve it off," 
Kika nodded, enlightened. "Damn it, Kika, that freak had his 
nerve," I struggled to maintain. "I know. Simmer down. It's 
not worth your precious sweat," she said gently and fired 
the first in a long series of menthol cigarettes.
