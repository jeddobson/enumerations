1 a few days after the workshop 2 we found 
her suspended from a noose 3 remarkably she'd made it 
herself out of rope 4 i didn't know she felt 
that way 5 she was a good person, really 6 
i used to see her around 7 we'd talk, you 
know, and sometimes 8 she'd come down to the workshop 
and listen 9 she had a cat. she talked to 
it 10 i don't know what's happened to it 11 
it showed up here once. i fed it 12 and 
then it disappeared 13 if only she'd spoken up. 14 
to anyone 15 it's such a waste. hanging 16 and 
you know, she wasn't a bad looking woman 17 not 
at all
