1 Cleveland and them hung out in that Watts cafe 
used to be 2 across the 3 tracks on a 
diagonal north of the workshop off 103rd. No 4 women 
were 5 allowed at that table unless being schemed upon, 
or of 6 exceptional beauty. 7 But I was a 
stubborn little mud hen at the fringe of the clique, 
8 starved 9 for approval. 10 So one day Cleveland 
and them was sitting at the table. Cleve 11 and 
maybe 12 Eric and one other brother. I boldly intruded 
on their 13 exclusivity with 14 my neat little sheaf 
of thin poems. 15 "And so you write?" and "Let 
us see one!" And the other 16 brother took it 
and 17 read it out loud and they passed it 
around the table. 18 "Hmmmm" and "Ahhhh." 19 And I 
blushed and my stomach tightened twice for each of my 
20 19 years. 21 "Oh yeeeaahhh," said Cleveland. "You are 
a writer, young 22 lady. As good a 23 writer 
as a man!" 24 And I caught the bus home, 
carrying his words with me, 25 clutching my thin 26 
little poems to my heart, 27 glowing in the dark.
