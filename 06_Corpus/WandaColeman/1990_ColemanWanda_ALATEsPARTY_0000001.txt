1 the dude who opens the door is as thin 
as 2 a dollar bill standing on its side 3 
he looks like he has the virus 4 i shake 
his hand hoping i have no cuts or 5 open 
sores. the hostess cheerily assures me 6 her roomy is 
a nice midwestern guy even though 7 they never had 
sex. i'm 8 reminded of time served on the TB 
ward 9 at county. all those skeletons walking 10 around 
gave me a permanent hanker for 11 meat on the 
bone. tonight 12 very few people show so i linger 
to 13 pay friendship dues and do the party. it's 
14 hard times. it's been well over twenty years 15 
since i've made a set where the main event's 16 
frankfurters and potato chips. not to 17 mention there's only 
"ade kool" 18 on the bar. there are two or 
three joints floating 19 around. i get grimly happy trying 
to get in 20 the spirit with some insignificant 21 
chit-chat then watch a video trying hard not to 22 
watch the clock. when my meter runs out i 23 
hurry home to soak my hands in betadine wash 24 
making note that sharing smokes these days is 25 really 
not where it's at
