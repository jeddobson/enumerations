many look few see mama called at six o'clock the 
morning time changed. while half asleep she'd heard via broadcast 
that one of the damned things had broken loose and 
slain a sightseer. they're closing down the exhibit. did we 
still want to go? after all, it's just a talk 
radio rumor of killer umbrellas. we opt to make our 
decision en route news reports verify the rumor. on death's 
intrusion the twenty- odd-million dollar indulgence is ordered closed by 
its stunned creator three days ahead of schedule. in Japan 
as in California. mama wants to see it more than 
ever, even if most of the seven- teen hundred "monstrosities" 
are shut down. we agree we want to someday tell 
our grandchildren we saw Christo's Folly. it's well worth braving 
bad weather and worse traffic even if we're late too 
late for full hillside bloom a thirty-three-year-old mother was smashed 
into the rocks. hours later a Japanese crane operator is 
electrocuted while dismantling the blue umbrellas. my lover and i 
debate the timing/morali- ty/wisdom of such art. thousands of citizens 
are homeless. too many of those stricken by the virus 
can't get treatment or decent digs in which to die 
meanwhile majestic iridescent yellow parasols rise out of moist gray 
mist mountainward: some lowered and tightly bound flapping against the 
wind, giant stubborn maize ghosts. a few storm-battered by gusts 
of sixty-five miles per hour have become fiery gold monarchs 
poised skyward. others are husks of starfish splat against earth. 
some lay lop-sided crashed over on tilted five- hundred pound 
cement anchors. one snapped free and skittered amok along the 
northbound lanes of the interstate. others, mere emaciated flaggings on 
this road less taken the sign reads closed ahead
