1 now, once billie holiday starts jonesing around 2 in 
your blood, and you're turning 3 the colors of her 
moods 4 there's nuthin' you can do about the itch 
in your ears 5 and you must forget about those 
gold sequins that keep 6 blitzing the inner screen of 
your eyeballs. too, 7 that thumping that starts at the 
back of your head and 8 makes its way along 
your spine, rumbas around in your hip 9 bones, tremors 
nearly dislocating them? learn. you can cope 10 with the 
aesthetic of it 11 provided your spirit's strong with song 
12 (you can't go wrong) 13 so what if you've 
gotten your bellyful of starfruit? 14 so what if even 
mojava heat 15 can't rid you of those croony riffs 
16 encasing your feet in rhythm? so what if a 
manhole was 17 opened in the main line to your 
soul? so what if noon after buzzy 18 noontime you 
find billie dancing in and out of your groin and 
19 so what if she's bled you whiter than a 
camellia's ghost 20 and 21 blued your eyes into the 
sky above her pain? don't 22 fight her. (might as 
well fight 23 spring) don't rue the whiskey-stained dark 24 
that gave birth to her. don't deny 25 the doomed-truth 
news of her final demise or put a damper on 
26 your 78-groove or silence those nightshine strummings on your 
27 heartstrings. so your throat's stung, deep-smoked by those heady 
28 embers of cafe society torch? swallow. time to love 
it 29 and live it again 30 relax. 31 and 
let Lady flow
