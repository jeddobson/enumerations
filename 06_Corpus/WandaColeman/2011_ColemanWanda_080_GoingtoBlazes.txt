when we set out on the train to Nowhere

i thought, we are going to be the greatest of lovers

but it was a tour of the grave of his first

the trip lasted twenty years. i was tired when we

reached the station. he could not find a taxi

to take us anywhere, let alone home

(our bodies cleansed in public restrooms)

we wandered the city like beggars, making

love in alleyways by moonlight,

white cement against the cobalt sky

“our essences have penetrated this ground, we are bound

to this place forever. it is holy,” he said

there, beyond our endless walk, i saw the spires

of the Harbor of Pleasure—the jetty of a thousand

pelicans where cabin cruisers, kayaks, catamarans,

powerboats, and yachts leisurely take the marina

armed battleships silhouetted on the horizon

reminders that terror is a mere plane flight away

we made our way to the viewpoint in an abandoned

vehicle. magically, i began to conjure picnic lunches

from my fingertips, food fit for an Emperor and his

Empress. we contemplated our escape from poverty

hour upon bittersweet hour, praying devoutly to

The Lord of Pigeons and The Guardian Crow

picture us this way: he is returned to beauty, the boy

giving way to the man, bike rider to bowed walker.

she, especially devout (quick to offer amusement), wears

tatters as if they were the satins and taffetas of youth

on Saturdays when the open wounds run blue

they descend from the joshuas, flying dreams, and

jazz, imagining escape even as they race backward

seeking a return to their salvation placed in storage

there,

above the vista, they stumble the profusion

an ideogram of silhouettes joined
