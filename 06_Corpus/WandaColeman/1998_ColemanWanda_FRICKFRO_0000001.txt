1 oh so negrodocious 2 i crack the claw of 
the well-breaded crustacean. 3 i am a good girl if 
not smart. 4 i am jealous of your recipe and 
too stupid to replicate it 5 in the kitchen. i 
succeed downward. i have 6 a high stomachline. suffering demands 
paralysis 7 but does that also mean being stuck on 
the plate? 8 when will race be a dead issue? 
9 i eat the angry off my lips 10 it 
goes straight to my breeder's hips 11 wham bam and 
loads of Spam. lickmedon'tlickme. 12 (please before you take my 
space allow 13 me the dignity of vanishing first.) starting 
to look 14 like my passport photo my mama the 
fat dress hung on 15 the hanger like i give 
big tips to feel substantial like 16 i ate clams 
Ferlinghetti in Kerouac sauce. 17 i succeed downward. like what 
they said i was. like 18 my word is as 
suspect as my money. like 19 i want to be 
fat for the right reasons. 20 i eat my disappointment 
21 it settles in my cheeks 22 i need the 
high but can't afford the dope. 23 i have nothing 
but blisters to show for three decades 24 of good 
behavior. my inability to steal effectively 25 is a major 
handicap. my story is the wrong story 26 but better 
than no story at all. 27 i eat my woeful 
hurt 28 it blows up in my thighs 29 eating 
in the dark can be messy. my worst habit 30 
is reading the fine print on canned apples. 31 my 
fake tooth was the gift of one homosexual lover 32 
to another in avoidance of a lawsuit. when will race 
33 cease to be an issue? my head is stone 
and 34 my fingers are asleep. i succeed downward. 35 
i need no teeth to eat my grief 36 it 
settles round my eyes 37 i am the one you 
must become to free me from 38 the tyranny of 
oatmeal. my memory is a blend of 39 confusions. therefore, 
if we must talk it under 40 let us discuss 
diseases caused by skinship 41 and the prevalence of violets
