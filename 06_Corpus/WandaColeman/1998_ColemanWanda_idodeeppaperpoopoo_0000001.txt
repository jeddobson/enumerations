1 i do deep paper poopoo. rebellious bowels and 2 
righteous stooping give me bragging rights. no 3 jazz about 
bluesmen twanging broken heartstrings or 4 hollow logs or rocks 
lumping up satin-sheeted beds 5 or hounddog bloods wailing sweetmamas 
while working 6 backwoods chaingangs and strumming up slave-rhyme 7 
in Texarkana jails. no mama don't allow no saxophones 8 
in here. no mama don't dig Harlem vamps or moonlight 
9 slummings with downtown tramps or spinning yarns in 10 
rail-yard camps. no take it mellow my educated fellow. no 
11 reds no blues no po'thang news no hippity-whos. less 
about 12 quality. it's still more about 13 what you 
suck who they own 14 what they will or won't 
politic 15 how long and how much you swallow
