1 our son's got math problems. his stepdad my 2 
lover goes to the school to check it out. he 
3 gives me a report on Mr. So-and-So. the man 
is a 4 uranian, very low profile, helpful and nice 
enough 5 but doesn't look well and is rather thin 
for a man 6 his size. but he's promised to 
assist our son as much 7 as possible 8 a 
few weeks later our son brings home a bad math 
9 report. we jam him. hasn't Mr. So-and-So been 10 
helping? he tells us the man's been out sick. we 
11 exchange a look and say nothing. so many uranians 
are 12 falling terminally ill these days. we decide we'll 
13 have to coach him ourselves. more time to sacrifice 
14 the next day my husband his stepdad calls the 
school to 15 ask about Mr. So-and-So. he's on indefinite 
medical leave 16 with something serious though no one will 
volunteer what 17 that is. odd for so young a 
man. we suspect he has the 18 virus and the 
school is keeping mum to avoid hysteria 19 among parents 
20 of course we may be wrong
