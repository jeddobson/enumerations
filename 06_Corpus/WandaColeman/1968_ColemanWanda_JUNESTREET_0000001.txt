1 nights we cruise the lush dark rich beyond reach 
2 take slowly the curves down lamp lit lanes 3 
drunk on architecture 4 spiral mahogany staircases, imported crystal 5 
warm toned carpets spun from starved flesh 6 intimate moves 
encased in stained glass/eyes 7 hacienda lattice-work drenched in violent 
bougainvillea 8 eucalyptus shaded lazes in a languid afterfuck 9 
only dope dealers, old money, entertainers 10 and corporate pros 
can cut the strut 11 echos of children at play 
engorged with quality time 12 the chimeras of dinner parties 
in cool PMs 13 round emerald pools with the up-and-cumming, 
holding 14 glasses of 15 straw blond champagne giddy in 
sweat sweet enuff to slurp 16 sporting a queen's crown 
of time to do nothing 17 but crawl up one's 
own wanton asshole 18 bid the poor follow with their 
tongues 19 yeah does it taste good
