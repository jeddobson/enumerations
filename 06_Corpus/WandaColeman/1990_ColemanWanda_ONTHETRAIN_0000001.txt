1 he's the last train in the station 2 i've 
been riding for hours 3 destination: a publishing party 4 
hope the bones will have plenty of meat left on 
them 5 by the time i arrive 6 people are 
meals to be digested 7 stories to scrawl on basement 
walls 8 poems to regurgitate 9 my stomach growls 10 
this might be my last meal 11 one can never 
trust tomorrow 12 she's a fickle bitch and will 13 
betray a niggah in a minute 14 he's the last 
train in the station 15 shuffles and scrapes his way 
across the 16 landscape of my sky 17 smoke stack 
of passion: a strange conductor 18 (blond and gray-eyed) 19 
people are salami, cheese and dill pickles 20 a whole 
deli of wild aromas and 52 flavors of flesh 21 
i confess my cannibalism---it's a gift 22 my mind growls 
23 this might be my last poem 24 i've never 
been able to trust my fingers 25 they always betray 
my mouth 26 they complain and steal the tears 27 
out of my eyes 28 he's the last train in 
the station 29 i'm taking him to the end of 
the line 30 to a banquet for renegade poets 31 
there will be plenty of raw meat to eat 32 
the wine of fresh blood 33 and for dessert, souls
