obsessions and passions

write themselves into being,

take over the room (sotospeak),

blast their ways into prominence

discordant descarga

dig—it would be the ultimate

desire to keep the brass in check,

to mute the onslaught before it

dulls—but better that than

a bad dose of lulls. this then is

the this then/a rainbow of

rhythms arcing the sky of perception

the reet, neat and replete

when explosions erupt into word

when the beat threatens coronary

when the ears turn inward, enrapt

by

the horn of one's tonality
