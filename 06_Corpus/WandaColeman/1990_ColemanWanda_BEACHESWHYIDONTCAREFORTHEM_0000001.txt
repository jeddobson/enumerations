1 associations: years of being ashamed/my sometimes 2 fat, ordinary 
body. years later shame passed 3 left a sad aftertaste. 
mama threatening to beat me if i got 4 my 
hair wet. curses as she brushes the sand out, "it's 
gonna 5 break it off---it's gonna ruin your scalp." 6 
or the tall blond haired gold/bronze-muscled 7 lifeguards who played 
with the little white ones but gawked 8 at us 
like we were lepers 9 sound. the water serpent's breath: 
a depth as vast as my hatred 10 skin. my 
chocolate coating. the rash gone now 11 as a kid 
i couldn't stand the drying effect water had 12 coming 
out wet, cracked and sore all over. one time 13 
i caught a starfish, second summer after my divorce 14 
"i'm not into beaches, or riding waves these days." the 
only 15 time 16 i like the beach is when 
it's cold hostile and gray. i feel 17 kin to 
it then. or at night. when it speaks a somber 
tongue 18 only the enlightened perceive. when the ageless mouth 
joins 19 mine. when soft arms caress in timeworn gentleness. 
or the 20 poor man's beach, where bodies echo my 
chromatic scheme 21 from just-can-pass to pitch-tar-black. at home among 
fleshy 22 rumps, tummys, thighs, 23 breasts jiggling a freedom 
our hearts will never know 24 sound. eternal splash. a 
depth as vast as my love 25 beached. i turn 
into the blanket. urge him to fuck me. he 26 
thinks it's corny. i get mad. i get up, stomp 
away, kicking 27 the sand ... while he was with 
her i was on 28 the beach wishing he was 
with me ... at the beach 29 aware of his 
hands urgent to touch, take me before we 30 return 
to work/our separate lives ... here. i watch 31 you 
swim into the crest. i'd rather sit and sip wine 
32 enjoy the wind than swim or wade. i smile 
secretly 33 at thinly clad slappers-on of lotion/a potion to 
ward off 34 skin cancer. in my fantasy i would 
challenge the ocean 35 a feminist ahab stalking the great 
white whale. harpoon it 36 and ride down down to 
meet davy jones, content 37 for my america dies with 
me 38 sound, swoosh swoosh the scythe. a depth as 
vast as my vision 39 i could live by it, 
pacifica. learn to like it. now that you're 40 with 
me i might even let you teach me how to 
tread water
