the java fires the lava flowing in my brain

hot wet sex-rider screaming stains

black cold heart bleeds lightning and rain

as the dame in tight red takes the names of

simpatico lames. bass notes cut rainbows thru me

trues me like falling ten stories into love

leaves me drunk and gliding on sweet brown

water like Jesus walking on jazz
