1 at the lip of a big black vagina 2 
birthing nappy-headed pickaninnies every hour on the hour 3 and 
soul radio blasting into mindwindow 4 bullets and blood 5 
see that helicopter up there? like 6 god's eye looking 
down on his children 7 barsandbarsandbarsandbarsandbars 8 where i live 
9 is the gap filled mouth of polly, the old 
black woman 10 up the street whose daughter's from new 
orleans and who 11 abandons her every holiday leaving her 
to wander 12 up and down the avenue and not 
even a holiday meal. she 13 collects the neighborhood trash 
and begs kindness in 14 doorways/always in the same browns, 
purples 15 and blues of her loneliness---a dress 16 that 
never fades or wears thin 17 where i live 18 
is the juke on the corner---hamburgerfishchilli smells 19 drawing hungry 
niggahs off the street and pimpmobiles 20 cluttering the asphalt 
parking lot. pool tables in the 21 back where much 
gambling and shit take place and 22 many niggahs fall 
to the knife of the violent surgeon. 23 one night 
me and cowboy were almost killed by a stray 24 
bullet from some renegade low riders and me and 25 
kathy used to go down and drop quarters 26 and 
listen to al green, and the dudes would hate 27 
my 'sditty ways and call me a dyke 28 'cause 
i wouldn't sell pussy 29 where i live 30 is 
the night club working one to six in the morning. 
31 cigarette burn holes in my stockings and wig full 
of 32 cigarette smoke. flesh bruised from niggahs pinching my 
33 meat and feeling my thighs, ears full of spit 
34 from whispers and obscene suggestions and mind full of 
35 sleep's spiders building a hazy nest---eyes full of 36 
rainbows looking forward to the day i leave this hell 
37 where i live 38 avoiding the landlord on the 
first and fifteenth when he 39 comes around to collect 
the rent. i'm four months behind 40 and wish i 
had a niggah to take care of me for a 
change 41 instead of taking me through changes. this building 
which 42 keeps chewing hunks out of the sides of 
people's cars and 43 the insane old bitch next door 
beating on the wall, scaring 44 the kids and telling 
me to shut up. every other day she calls 45 
the cops out here and i hope they don't run 
a make on me 46 and find all them warrants 
47 where i live 48 the little gangsters diddy-bop through 
and pick up 49 young bitches and flirt with old 
ones, looking to 50 snatch somebody's purse or find their 
way into somebody's 51 snatch 'cause mama don't want them 
at home and papa 52 is a figment and them 
farms them farms them farms 53 they call schools. and 
mudflapped bushy-headed entities 54 swoop the avenues seeking death 55 
it's the only thrill left 56 where i live 57 
at the lip of a big black vagina 58 birthing 
nappy-headed pickaninnies every hour on the hour 59 the county 
is her pimp and she can turn a trick 60 
swifter than any bitch ever graced this earth 61 she's 
the baddest piece of ass on the west coast 62
