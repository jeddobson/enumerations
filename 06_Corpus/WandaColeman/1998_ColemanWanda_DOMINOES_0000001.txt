1 she breaks her back while he's 2 sittin' out 
yonder under 3 the shade tree with his cronies playin' 
4 layin' ivory double down. and so much beer 5 
risin' before it passes thru 6 his kidneys he damned 
near look as pregnant as her 7 she got angry 
breasts and her hips are 8 liable to join the 
action. but 9 she can usually find him when she
