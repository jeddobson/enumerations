1 value is as value does 2 i can't get 
good service or is it just me? 3 i use 
my real name 4 but the best i can do 
is imagine small's paradise 5 who do i thank for 
being so skunked 6 so razzed so out of sync 
7 excuse me for the eyes in the back of 
my head 8 sad 9 of thee of thee of 
thee singing 10 i am bold patriot. i embrace the 
nation/notion 11 that condemns me. i've never confessed 12 to 
anything that wasn't public policy. all i 13 ever wanted 
was enuff green to cover the black 14 i cook 
all day i cook all night 15 i conjure conjure 
till the roux is right 16 (he says i have 
a high mind 17 and a whore's hips) 18 i 
prepare the oven 19 for a meal of bones 20 
for a plate of the lover 21 who leaves me 
alone 22 when social daily becomes habit---arf arf 23 rewriting 
the turf as i rave thru it 24 stripped naked 
25 my truth hangs by its nappy mane 26 strung 
up in the candy shop window 27 its hands crossed 
over its pubis, sprays 28 the third element of creation
