1 he calls to tell me something. the something 2 
gets caught and can't make it out 3 he struggles 
with it over the wire 4 my eyes straining to 
sniff the slightest touch5 biting snarling snapping words come out 
dum-dum bullets 6 into my chest and blood jumps out 
on me 7 and a little gets on him 8 
he goes into the bathroom for a towel 9 hands 
it to me, mutely10 dialing the phone number 11 click---he's 
there on the receiving end 12 i hear him waiting 
for my voice 13 hang up hastily, flushing 14 he 
knows it's me15 my eyes are trapped in his fists 
16 his mouth shapes the syllables that translate bitch 17 
the scream hides between cold sheets 18 it snuggles against 
my thigh19 his smile enters the room cautiously 20 finds 
its way to my face 21 stays until i wash
