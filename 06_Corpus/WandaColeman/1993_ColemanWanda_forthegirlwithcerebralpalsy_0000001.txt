1 you dive into a spasm and twist your sweetness 
2 as we bend toward you to understand 3 words 
thick-tongued and fresh with spittle 4 your body rocking your 
eyes rolling with self-impatience 5 your arms angling against air 
6 you've come to the decision to give up 7 
your child. afraid you will go off, leave him 8 
and he will starve. yes you love him but cannot 
9 love yourself the mirror image of parents 10 unable 
to "love imperfection" 11 and now you unfold before us 
the origami of your 12 shame. a ring of strange 
paper dolls holding ragged 13 hands/jagged pieces of tissue too 
frail 14 even for tears
