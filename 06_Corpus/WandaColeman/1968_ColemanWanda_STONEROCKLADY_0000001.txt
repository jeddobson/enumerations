1 i take stone injections 2 brittle tracks of granite 
in my arm 3 ---the rock lady--- 4 soul of 
flint 5 heart of mica 6 eye of diamond 7 
flash---a smile---my quartz teeth 8 try and pierce my zinkenite 
vagina 9 i will break you if you're made of 
glass 10 i take stone injections 11 blood is the 
red of brick 12 solid against the watery tide of 
emotions 13 my defense against love, against fear 14 rock 
ladies can only exist 15 like mountains 16 like pyramids 
17 like pavement 18 solid 19 i take stone injections 
20 the asphalt crispness of my skin chills to touch 
21 my arms crush the men i make 22 especially 
the ones of shale 23 who are delicate, egotists 24 
who make the mistake of thinking 25 their sheet rock 
dicks 26 are enough to bring me crumbling to my 
knees 27 solid 28 i roll up my sleeves 29 
take stone injections 30 they steel me against the world 
31 i want to be able to take it all 
32 and come away whole 33 the rock lady 34 
without a flaw in her onyx surface 35 solid as 
gibraltar
