1 schemin' and dreamin' 2 something about Amos. he wore 
his hat like 3 an aviator and drove that cab 
like a dive bomber 4 scoping in on enemy installations, 
sported that 5 jacket with pride debonair, not to mention 
6 he always made good sense 7 more than Lightning 
who, i would discover years 8 later, was merely caught 
in the act of being himself 9 more than tall 
Mr. Andrew H. Brown, foil and 10 thick-lipped good-natured sidekick 
whose 11 dome-lidded bowler was an extension of his head 
12 and there wasn't much in either. his expression of 
13 shock was manifest ugly, an ill-fitting cigar 14 popping 
out as his mouth froze into an O 15 even 
in black and white i imagined his gums a 16 
pinker blush than Veronica Lake's thighs when she 17 did 
a peek-a-boo 18 the only thing i dug 'bout Amos 
'n Andy 19 were the grand opening credits which rolled 
20 across a mock urban skyline to a choir singing 
21 as if in nigger heaven. i'd imagine myself grown 
up 22 sitting in a bar, sipping the beer that 
made 23 Milwaukee famous, looking fine and dressed to the 
nines 24 i never guessed time would 25 peg me 
in the hole of Kingfish
