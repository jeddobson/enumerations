1 bed calls. i sit in the dark in the 
living room 2 trying to ignore them 3 in the 
morning, especially Sunday mornings 4 it will not let me 
up, you must sleep 5 longer, it says 6 facing 
south 7 the bed makes me lay heavenward on my 
back 8 while i prefer a westerly fetal position 9 
facing the wall 10 the bed sucks me sideways into 
it when i 11 sit down on it to put 
on my shoes. this 12 persistence on its part forces 
me to dress in 13 the bathroom where things are 
less subversive 14 the bed lumps up in anger springs 
popping out to 15 scratch my dusky thighs 16 my 
little office sits in the alcove adjacent to 17 the 
bed. it makes strange little sighs 18 which distract me 
from my work 19 sadistically i pull back the covers 
20 put my typewriter on the sheet and turn it 
on 21 the bed complains that i'm difficult duty 22 
its slats are collapsing. it bitches when i 23 blanket 
it with books and papers. it tells me 24 it's 
made for blood and bone 25 lately spiders ants and 
roaches 26 have invaded it searching for food
