1 summer 2 beached again. i hate being beached. the 
affirmation of my 3 poverty, stranded on an inner city 
cement dune as white as 4 the center of sun, 
cold as iceberg. i sulk in the middle of it

can't explain that this is my last 29 scuffle. i

this 30 chronic scream. this shroud my skin claims me
