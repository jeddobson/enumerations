1 looking for meaning i motor in circles towards 2 
downtown in a smog south now east now north 3 
back west along a gray narrowness making a right at 
4 the second light. something red screams stop 5 i 
ease the brakes to a squeak. intracellular pressure 6 i 
can't see the sun. it's overcast and cool 7 pulling 
into a fast-stop-quick-shop i spy this gangster 8 in ragged 
denims his right lower leg in a plaster cast 9 
protected by a neatly wrapped trash bag he's into 10 
heavy loiter hustles a gray boy for change after 11 
slap-dashing his windshield. he sees me seeing him 12 "hey 
Sugaroo, iszat yo' cahr?" he smiles as i pass 13 
"yeah, what's left of it" i sing over my shoulder 
14 my tore-down Buick evokes his soft laughter 15 he 
sees we're coming from the same place 16 but the 
store don't carry the proof of stress relief 17 required 
to take my mind off---to liberate my erythrocytes. 18 if 
only i had the peace 19 or the mind 20 
hastily he sincerely takes his brown terry rag and 21 
busts the escapees from the ozone layer. i check him 
22 out. five years ago we might've done more than 
chuckle 23 like conspirators---ebony skins good looks 24 hungry white 
teeth 25 at whose service? 26 what's left to enjoy 
under the guise of what? 27 game after game for 
pretense of acceptance 28 bone on bone 29 i'm reminded 
of Manhattan bloods hostile in their 30 assault on denizen 
drivers, forcing them to pay 31 spraying like whacked-out captain 
zodiacs 32 spraying for juice money/enuff to score 33 spraying 
foam thick as cum 34 i decline his offer to 
wash my rear window 35 he smiles again insisting he 
finish the job/a good 36 worker/would-be lover if-and-when 37 i 
go into my wine kidskin wallet for a neatly 38 
furled Washington 39 "thanx, Sugaroo. be good now," he laughs 
again 40 tucks it away 41 i fire the ignition 
and resume pursuit of my 42 own tail. what's left 
of morning settles 43 around my eyes a darkly visible 
weight 44 and they say good black don't crack 45 
still arguing God
