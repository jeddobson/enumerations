i pushed my fingers thru Clive's scrotum and wiggled them 
around. he felt no pain and did not complain. his 
face was scrunched up in concentrated pleasure as he pumped 
away on top of me. i turned my face to 
my right and strained to peep at my fingers. they 
were perfectly clean. i sniffed for some detail of scent. 
there was none. and while i felt little beyond a 
vague discomfort he was groaning ecstatically in the throes of 
orgasm. he rose abruptly and reached for the towel on 
the night table. "that was fucking incredible. how was it 
for you?" "equally incredible," i lied. he smiled so broadly 
and so sincerely i regretted hav- ing to lie. i 
had no choice. "let's shower then have breakfast somewhere," he 
chirped. "cool with me." all i wanted was a hot 
croissant. i buttered it lavishly but could only pick at 
it over my coffee. "something's wrong, Regina. i can feel 
it." "i'm glad you can." "what's that supposed to mean?" 
"i'm not feeling well ... is all." "why didn't you 
say so? i could've waited." "i don't mean sex. i---i'm 
not sure what's come over me. the world doesn't seem 
to have much substance anymore." "that's overstating it. one need 
only take a look at the evening news to ascertain 
that much." "that's not quite what i mean." i brooded 
for too pregnant a second, bursting with my truth, debating 
on telling him. i hadn't the nerve or the energy. 
"it's nothing, Clive, i guess---bad digestion, as they say in 
the gothics. i can't eat this thing." "well, we can't 
let good French pastry go to waste, now can we?" 
he said and lifted it from my saucer.
