1 yes, Camus said 2 death does 3 once a 
20th century merlin, ah 4 but i swore i would 
cease to gibber/should not 5 till recognition was imminent---not for 
my 6 translucent beatic efforts but of my jet skin---both? 
7 in dire truth i could not speak. one thousand 
saxophones 8 stilled. some evil word magician seized my eloquent 
9 vibrato, would not let go/halted my seraphic loquaciousness 10 
i was set upon by sinister malaise/pernicious dread ate 11 
greedily of my brain, feasted on my melodic wind 12 
got stumbling stinko in my ancient rain 13 dried up 
all emotive jizz. pyretic blisters crowded in 14 on my 
rogue tongue 15 my pristine word-faith sanguinely stained 16 my 
face became mask 17 my eyes dreary yellowed ellipses 18 
my back curled and snaked 19 thus i remained a 
decade, more 20 when suddenly suddenly i was shaken from 
slumber 21 by the reveille of an angry race 22 
i woke in an abomunist hissy 23 in time 24 
to seize my final solitude
