1 my tattered fence stands upside down like 2 inverted 
teeth chewing on old mutton each white 3 termite-bitten picket 
streaked ugly gray and brown 4 thick layered latex, the 
paint shrieks off. no 5 invitation here---for friend or stranger. 
there's a hole 6 drilled deeply there by our neighbor 
who peers as 7 we twist out our obsessions on 
unkempt lawn
