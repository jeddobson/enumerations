what wakes you in the dead of a dream

and what does it mean to cease dreaming?

there are books by those who attempt explanation

blame it on desire on confusion on confection

perhaps the tender kiss of a spirit

a kink unresolved, rocks in the sheets

what forces you from your bed into the dimness

to peer about for traces of a name once called?

the excitement of a first night? the sadness of a last?

the residual indigestible intoxicants of emotions?

the echo of fingers probing and entering, the

deep sweetness of remembered palms and purrings?

how is it the darkness wears your eyes?

looks back at you and swears the search is fruitless?

where are you going? to the end of the hallway?

outside into the coolness? does a garden await?

those arms that reach out, are they the arms

do they fit snug about you or do they flag in air?

what is it that fills your imagination? are you seen

as you see? do you too emerge upon a wish?

hold tightly to the prize that anchors you to a

once-savored moment, a slim volume, a stone

the distant singings of another forever in your ears

here you are

awash in the midnight of midnights

having left the world without a whisper
