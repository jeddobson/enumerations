1 my heart in my ear his baby we need 
to talk jazz 2 later as in after the rain 
sleeping in the ghost 3 of his arms the essence 
of a beard tickling the roots 4 of wag about 
jobs not gotten and the life i'd live if 5 
only you'd get with it jazz couldn't fill enough hours 
6 trying to avoid the phone which did not ring 
the letter that 7 didn't arrive the love that was 
not stolen in sufficient 8 quantities. oh i said and 
oh the mirror answers 9 each time we pretend you 
are never on my mind
