My hurt turns livid upon me as I lean on 
a cane and observe. I am the mashed fireman with 
breastbone broken . . . . tumbling walls buried me 
in their debris, Heat and smoke I inspired . . 
. . I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades, 
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;They 
have cleared the beams away . . . . they 
tenderly lift me forth. I lie in the night air 
in my red shirt . . . . the pervading 
hush is for my sake, Painless after all I lie, 
exhausted but not so unhappy,White and beautiful are the faces 
around me . . . . the heads are bared 
of their fire- caps, The kneeling crowd fades with the 
light of the torches.Distant and dead resuscitate, They show as 
the dial or move as the hands of me . 
. . . and I am the clock myself. I 
am an old artillerist, and tell of some fort's bombardment 
. . . . and am there again. Again the 
reveille of drummers . . . . again the attacking 
cannon and mortars and howitzers, Again the attacked send their 
cannon responsive. I take part . . . . I 
see and hear the whole, The cries and curses and 
roar . . . . the plaudits for well aimed 
shots, The ambulanza slowly passing and trailing its red drip,Workmen 
searching after damages and to make indispensible repairs, The fall 
of grenades through the rent roof . . . . 
the fan-shaped explosion, The whizz of limbs heads stone wood 
and iron high in the air. Again gurgles the mouth 
of my dying general . . . . he furiously 
waves with his hand, He gasps through the clot .
