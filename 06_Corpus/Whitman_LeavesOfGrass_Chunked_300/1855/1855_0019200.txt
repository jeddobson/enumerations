do not say they are not divine, I say they 
have all grown out of you and may grow out 
of you still, It is not they who give the 
life . . . . it is you who give 
the life; Leaves are not more shed from the trees 
or trees from the earth than they are shed out 
of you. The sum of all known value and respect 
I add up in you whoever you are; The President 
is up there in the White House for you . 
. . . it is not you who are here 
for him, The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you 
. . . . not you here for them, The 
Congress convenes every December for you, Laws, courts, the forming 
of states, the charters of cities, the going and coming 
of commerce and mails are all for you. All doctrines, 
all politics and civilization exurge from you, All sculpture and 
monuments and anything inscribed anywhere are tallied in you, The 
gist of histories and statistics as far back as the 
records reach is in you this hour—and myths and tales 
the same; If you were not breathing and walking here 
where would they all be? The most renowned poems would 
be ashes . . . . orations and plays would 
be vacuums. All architecture is what you do to it 
when you look upon it; Did you think it was 
in the white or gray stone? or the lines of 
the arches and cornices? All music is what awakens from 
you when you are reminded by the instruments, It is 
not the violins and the cornets . . . . 
it is not the oboe nor the beating drums— nor 
the notes of the baritone singer singing his sweet romanza
