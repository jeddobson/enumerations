wish long and long to be with him . . 
. . you would wish to sit by him in 
the boat that you and he might touch each other. 
I have perceived that to be with those I like 
is enough,To stop in company with the rest at evening 
is enough,To be surrounded by beautiful curious breathing laughing flesh 
is enough, To pass among them . . to touch 
any one . . . . to rest my arm 
ever so lightly round his or her neck for a 
moment . . . . what is this then? I 
do not ask any more delight . . . . 
I swim in it as in a sea. There is 
something in staying close to men and women and looking 
on them and in the contact and odor of them 
that pleases the soul well, All things please the soul, 
but these please the soul well. This is the female 
form, A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to 
foot, It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, I am drawn 
by its breath as if I were no more than 
a helpless vapor . . . . all falls aside 
but myself and it, Books, art, religion, time . . 
the visible and solid earth . . the atmosphere and 
the fringed clouds . . what was expected of heaven 
or feared of hell are now consumed, Mad filaments, ungovernable 
shoots play out of it . . the response likewise 
ungovern- able, Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling 
hands â€”all diffused . . . . mine too diffused, 
Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the 
ebb . . . . loveflesh swelling and deliciously aching, 
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous . .
