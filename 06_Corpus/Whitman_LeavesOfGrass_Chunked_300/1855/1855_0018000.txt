is welcome by day or night, I must be personally 
as welcome; If you have become degraded or ill, then 
I will become so for your sake; If you remember 
your foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think I cannot 
remember my foolish and outlawed deeds? If you carouse at 
the table I say I will carouse at the opposite 
side of the table; If you meet some stranger in 
the street and love him or her, do I not 
often meet strangers in the street and love them? If 
you see a good deal remarkable in me I see 
just as much remarkable in you. Why what have you 
thought of yourself? Is it you then that thought yourself 
less? Is it you that thought the President greater than 
you? or the rich better off than you? or the 
educated wiser than you? Because you are greasy or pimpled—or 
that you was once drunk, or a thief, or diseased, 
or rheumatic, or a prostitute—or are so now—or from frivolity 
or impotence—or that you are no scholar, and never saw 
your name in print . . . . do you 
give in that you are any less immortal? Souls of 
men and women! it is not you I call unseen, 
unheard, untouchable and untouching; It is not you I go 
argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you 
are alive or no; I own publicly who you are, 
if nobody else owns . . . . and see 
and hear you, and what you give and take; What 
is there you cannot give and take? I see not 
merely that you are polite or whitefaced . . . 
. married or single . . . . citizens of 
old states or citizens of new states . . .
