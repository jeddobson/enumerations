life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains 
at the end but threadbare crape and tears. Whimpering and 
truckling fold with powders for invalids . . . . 
conformity goes to the fourth-removed, I cock my hat as 
I please indoors or out. Shall I pray? Shall I 
venerate and be ceremonious? I have pried through the strata 
and analyzed to a hair,And counselled with doctors and calculated 
close and found no sweeter fat than sticks to my

and not one a barleycorn less, And the good or 
bad I say of myself I say of them. And 
I know I am solid and sound, To me the 
converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, All are written 
to me, and I must get what the writing means. 
And I know I am deathless, I know this orbit 
of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass, I 
know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut 
with a burnt stick at night. I know I am 
august, I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself 
or be understood, I see that the elementary laws never 
apologize, I reckon I behave no prouder than the level 
I plant my house by after all. I exist as 
I am, that is enough, If no other in the 
world be aware I sit content, And if each and 
all be aware I sit content. One world is aware, 
and by far the largest to me, and that is 
myself, And whether I come to my own today or 
in ten thousand or ten million years, I can cheerfully 
take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait. 
My foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite, I laugh
