. . they are the same in all times and 
shall not be disturbed. ï»¿Great are marriage, commerce, newspapers, books, 
freetrade, railroads, steamers, international mails and telegraphs and exchanges. Great 
is Justice; Justice is not settled by legislators and laws 
. . . . it is in the soul, It 
cannot be varied by statutes any more than love or 
pride or the attraction of gravity can, It is immutable 
. . it does not depend on majorities . . 
. . majorities or what not come at last before 
the same passionless and exact tribunal. For justice are the 
grand natural lawyers and perfect judges . . . . 
it is in their souls, It is well assorted . 
. . . they have not studied for nothing . 
. . . the great includes the less, They rule 
on the highest grounds . . . . they oversee 
all eras and states and administrations. The perfect judge fears 
nothing . . . . he could go front to 
front before God, Before the perfect judge all shall stand 
back . . . . life and death shall stand 
back . . . . heaven and hell shall stand 
back. Great is goodness; I do not know what it 
is any more than I know what health is . 
. . . but I know it is great. Great 
is wickedness . . . . I find I often 
admire it just as much as I admire good- ness: 
Do you call that a paradox? It certainly is a 
paradox.The eternal equilibrium of things is great, and the eternal 
overthrow of things is great, And there is another paradox. 
Great is life . . and real and mystical . 
. wherever and whoever, Great is death . . . 
. Sure as life holds all parts together, death holds 
all parts together; Sure as the stars return again after 
they merge in the light, death is great as life.
