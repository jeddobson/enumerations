the lethargic mist, And took my time . . . 
. and took no hurt from the foetid carbon. Long 
I was hugged close . . . . long and 
long. Immense have been the preparations for me, Faithful and 
friendly the arms that have helped me. Cycles ferried my 
cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen; For room to 
me stars kept aside in their own rings, They sent 
influences to look after what was to hold me.Before I 
was born out of my mother generations guided me,My embryo 
has never been torpid . . . . nothing could 
overlay it; For it the nebula cohered to an orb 
. . . . the long slow strata piled to 
rest it on . . . . vast vegetables gave 
it sustenance, Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and 
deposited it with care. All forces have been steadily employed 
to complete and delight me, Now I stand on this 
spot with my soul. Span of youth! Ever-pushed elasticity! Manhood 
balanced and florid and full! My lovers suffocate me! Crowding 
my lips, and thick in the pores of my skin, 
Jostling me through streets and public halls . . . 
. coming naked to me at night, Crying by day 
Ahoy from the rocks of the river . . . 
. swinging and chirping over my head, Calling my name 
from flowerbeds or vines or tangled underbrush, Or while I 
swim in the bath . . . . or drink 
from the pump at the corner . . . . 
or the curtain is down at the opera . . 
. . or I glimpse at a woman's face in 
the railroad car; Lighting on every moment of my life, 
Bussing my body with soft and balsamic busses, Noiselessly passing
