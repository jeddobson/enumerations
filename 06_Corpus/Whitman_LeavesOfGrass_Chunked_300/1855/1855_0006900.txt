keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head 
and heart, Copulation is no more rank to me than 
death is. I believe in the flesh and the appetites, 
Seeing hearing and feeling are miracles, and each part and 
tag of me is a miracle. Divine am I inside 
and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or 
am touched from; The scent of these arm-pits is aroma 
finer than prayer,This head is more than churches or bibles 
or creeds. If I worship any particular thing it shall 
be some of the spread of my body; Translucent mould 
of me it shall be you, Shaded ledges and rests, 
firm masculine coulter, it shall be you, Whatever goes to 
the tilth of me it shall be you, You my 
rich blood, your milky stream pale strippings of my life; 
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you.My 
brain it shall be your occult convolutions, Root of washed 
sweet-flag, timorous pond-snipe, nest of guarded duplicate eggs, it shall 
be you, Mixed tussled hay of head and beard and 
brawn it shall be you, Trickling sap of maple, fibre 
of manly wheat, it shall be you; Sun so generous 
it shall be you, Vapors lighting and shading my face 
it shall be you, You sweaty brooks and dews it 
shall be you, Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me 
it shall be you, Broad muscular fields, branches of liveoak, 
loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you, 
Hands I have taken, face I have kissed, mortal I 
have ever touched, it shall be you. I dote on 
myself . . . . there is that lot of 
me, and all so luscious, Each moment and whatever happens 
thrills me with joy.I cannot tell how my ankles bend
