handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be 
mine. Old age superbly rising! Ineffable grace of dying days!Every 
condition promulges not only itself . . . . it 
promulges what grows after and out of itself, And the 
dark hush promulges as much as any. I open my 
scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, And all 
I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge 
but the rim of the farther systems. Wider and wider 
they spread, expanding and always expanding, Outward and outward and 
forever outward. My sun has his sun, and round him 
obediently wheels, He joins with his partners a group of 
superior circuit,And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest 
inside them. There is no stoppage, and never can be 
stoppage; If I and you and the worlds and all 
beneath or upon their surfaces, and all the palpable life, 
were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it 
would not avail in the long run, We should surely 
bring up again where we now stand, And as surely 
go as much farther, and then farther and farther. A 
few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, 
do not hazard the span, or make it impatient, They 
are but parts . . . . any thing is 
but a part. See ever so far . . . 
. there is limitless space outside of that, Count ever 
so much . . . . there is limitless time 
around that. Our rendezvous is fitly appointed . . . 
. God will be there and wait till we come. 
I know I have the best of time and spaceâ€”and 
that I was never measured, and never will be measured. 
I tramp a perpetual journey, My signs are a rain-proof
