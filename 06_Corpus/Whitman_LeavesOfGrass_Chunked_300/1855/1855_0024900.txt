of the afternoon she went away; O my mother was 
loth to have her go away, All the week she 
thought of her . . . . she watched for 
her many a month, She remembered her many a winter 
and many a summer, But the red squaw never came 
nor was heard of there again. Now Lucifer was not 
dead . . . . or if he was I 
am his sorrowful terrible heir; I have been wronged . 
. . . I am oppressed . . . . 
I hate him that oppresses me, I will either destroy 
him, or he shall release me. Damn him! how he 
does defile me, How he informs against my brother and 
sister and takes pay for their blood, How he laughs 
when I look down the bend after the steamboat that 
carries away my woman. Now the vast dusk bulk that 
is the whale's bulk . . . . it seems 
mine, Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, 
my tap is death. A show of the summer softness 
. . . . a contact of something unseen . 
. . . an amour of the light and air; 
I am jealous and overwhelmed with friendliness, And will go 
gallivant with the light and the air myself,And have an 
unseen something to be in contact with them also. O 
love and summer! you are in the dreams and in 
me, Autumn and winter are in the dreams . . 
. . the farmer goes with his thrift, The droves 
and crops increase . . . . the barns are 
wellfilled. Elements merge in the night . . . . 
ships make tacks in the dreams . . . . 
the sailor sails . . . . the exile returns
