or loss or lack of money . . . . 
or depressions or exaltations, They come to me days and 
nights and go from me again,But they are not the 
Me myself. Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what

is erect, bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, 
Looks with its sidecurved head curious what will come next,

not music or rhyme I want . . . . 
not custom or lecture, not even the best, Only the 
lull I like, the hum of your valved voice. I

morning; You settled your head athwart my hips and gently 
turned over upon me, And parted the shirt from my 
bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my barestript heart, And 
reached till you felt my beard, and reached till you 
held my feet. Swiftly arose and spread around me the 
peace and joy and knowledge that pass all the art 
and argument of the earth; And I know that the 
hand of God is the elderhand of my own, And 
I know that the spirit of God is the eldest
