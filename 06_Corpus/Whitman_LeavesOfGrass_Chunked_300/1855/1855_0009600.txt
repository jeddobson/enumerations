cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering 
of their hides, Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, 
and andirons straddle the hearth-slab, and cobwebs fall in festoons

find, At musters and beach-parties and friendly bees and huskings 
and house-raisings; Where the mockingbird sounds his delicious gurgles, and 
cackles and screams and weeps, Where the hay-rick stands in 
the barnyard, and the dry-stalks are scattered, and the brood
