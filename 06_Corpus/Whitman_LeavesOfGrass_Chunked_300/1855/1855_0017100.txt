to the polished breasts of melons. And as to you 
life, I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, 
No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.I 
hear you whispering there O stars of heaven, O suns 
. . . . O grass of graves . . 
. . O perpetual transfers and promotions . . . 
. if you do not say anything how can I 
say anything? Of the turbid pool that lies in the 
autumn forest, Of the moon that descends the steeps of 
the soughing twilight, Toss, sparkles of day and dusk . 
. . . toss on the black stems that decay 
in the muck, Toss to the moaning gibberish of the 
dry limbs. I ascend from the moon . . . 
. I ascend from the night,And perceive of the ghastly 
glitter the sunbeams reflected, And debouch to the steady and 
central from the offspring great or small. There is that 
in me . . . . I do not know 
what it is . . . . but I know 
it is in me. Wrenched and sweaty . . . 
. calm and cool then my body becomes; I sleep 
. . . . I sleep long. I do not 
know it . . . . it is without name 
. . . . it is a word unsaid, It 
is not in any dictionary or utterance or symbol. Something 
it swings on more than the earth I swing on,To 
it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me. 
Perhaps I might tell more . . . . Outlines! 
I plead for my brothers and sisters. Do you see 
O my brothers and sisters? It is not chaos or 
death . . . . it is form and union
