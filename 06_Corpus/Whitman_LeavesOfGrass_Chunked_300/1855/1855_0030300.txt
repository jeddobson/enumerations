. . . . Its hands tight to the throats 
of kings. O hope and faith! O aching close of 
lives! O many a sickened heart! Turn back unto this 
day, and make yourselves afresh. And you, paid to defile 
the People . . . . you liars mark: Not 
for numberless agonies, murders, lusts, For court thieving in its 
manifold mean forms, Worming from his simplicity the poor man's 
wages; For many a promise sworn by royal lips, And 
broken, and laughed at in the breaking, Then in their 
power not for all these did the blows strike of 
personal revenge . . or the heads of the nobles 
fall; The People scorned the ferocity of kings. But the 
sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened rulers 
come back: Each comes in state with his train . 
. . . hangman, priest and tax-gatherer . . .

a Shape, Vague as the night, draped interminably, head front 
and form in scarlet folds, Whose face and eyes none 
may see, Out of its robes only this . . 
. . the red robes, lifted by the arm, One 
finger pointed high over the top, like the head of 
a snake appears. Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves . 
. . . bloody corpses of young men: The rope 
of the gibbet hangs heavily . . . . the 
bullets of princes are flying . . . . the 
creatures of power laugh aloud, And all these things bear 
fruits . . . . and they are good. Those 
corpses of young men, Those martyrs that hang from the 
gibbets . . . those hearts pierced by the gray 
lead, Cold and motionless as they seem . . live
