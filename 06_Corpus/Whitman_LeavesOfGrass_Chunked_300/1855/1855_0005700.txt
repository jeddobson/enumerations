at what you call dissolution, And I know the amplitude 
of time. I am the poet of the body, And 
I am the poet of the soul. The pleasures of 
heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are 
with me, The first I graft and increase upon myself 
. . . . the latter I translate into a 
new tongue. I am the poet of the woman the 
same as the man, And I say it is as 
great to be a woman as to be a man,And 
I say there is nothing greater than the mother of 
men.I chant a new chant of dilation or pride, We 
have had ducking and deprecating about enough, I show that 
size is only developement. Have you outstript the rest? Are 
you the President? It is a trifle . . . 
. they will more than arrive there every one, and 
still pass on. I am he that walks with the 
tender and growing night;I call to the earth and sea 
half-held by the night. Press close barebosomed night! Press close 
magnetic nourishing night! Night of south winds! Night of the 
large few stars! Still nodding night! Mad naked summer night! 
Smile O voluptuous coolbreathed earth! Earth of the slumbering and 
liquid trees! Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains 
misty-topt! Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon 
just tinged with blue! Earth of shine and dark mottling 
the tide of the river!Earth of the limpid gray of 
clouds brighter and clearer for my sake! Far-swooping elbowed earth! 
Rich apple-blossomed earth!Smile, for your lover comes! Prodigal! you have 
given me love! . . . . therefore I to 
you give love! O unspeakable passionate love! Thruster holding me 
tight and that I hold tight! We hurt each other
