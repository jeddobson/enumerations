and this mystery here we stand. Clear and sweet is 
my soul . . . . and clear and sweet 
is all that is not my soul. Lack one lacks 
both . . . . and the unseen is proved 
by the seen, Till that becomes unseen and receives proof 
in its turn.Showing the best and dividing it from the 
worst, age vexes age, Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity 
of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go 
bathe and admire myself. Welcome is every organ and attribute 
of me, and of any man hearty and clean, Not 
an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, 
and none shall be less familiar than the rest. I 
am satisfied . . . . I see, dance, laugh, 
sing; As God comes a loving bedfellow and sleeps at 
my side all night and close on the peep of 
the day, And leaves for me baskets covered with white 
towels bulging the house with their plenty, Shall I postpone 
my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, That 
they turn from gazing after and down the road, And 
forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, Exactly the 
contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and 
which is ahead? Trippers and askers surround me, People I 
meet . . . . . the effect upon me 
of my early life . . . . of the 
ward and city I live in . . . . 
of the nation, The latest news . . . . 
discoveries, inventions, societies . . . . authors old and 
new, My dinner, dress, associates, looks, business, compliments, dues, The 
real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I 
love, The sickness of one of my folksâ€”or of myself
