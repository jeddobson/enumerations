voter . . the politician, The emigrant and the exile 
. . the criminal that stood in the box, He 
who has been famous, and he who shall be famous 
after today, The stammerer . . . . the wellformed 
person . . the wasted or feeble person. I am 
she who adorned herself and folded her hair expectantly, My 
truant lover has come and it is dark. Double yourself 
and receive me darkness, Receive me and my lover too 
. . . . he will not let me go 
without him. I roll myself upon you as upon a 
bed . . . . I resign myself to the 
dusk. He whom I call answers me and takes the 
place of my lover, He rises with me silently from 
the bed. Darkness you are gentler than my lover . 
. . . his flesh was sweaty and panting, I 
feel the hot moisture yet that he left me. My 
hands are spread forth . . I pass them in 
all directions, I would sound up the shadowy shore to 
which you are journeying. Be careful, darkness . . . 
. already, what was it touched me? I thought my 
lover had gone . . . . else darkness and 
he are one, I hear the heart-beat . . . 
. I follow . . I fade away.O hotcheeked and 
blushing! O foolish hectic! O for pity's sake, no one 
must see me now! . . . . my clothes 
were stolen while I was abed, Now I am thrust 
forth, where shall I run? Pier that I saw dimly 
last night when I looked from the windows, Pier out 
from the main, let me catch myself with you and 
stay . . . . I will not chafe you;
