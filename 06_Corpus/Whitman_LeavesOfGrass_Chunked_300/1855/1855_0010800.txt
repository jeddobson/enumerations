wreck of the steamship, and death chasing it up and 
down the storm, How he knuckled tight and gave not 
back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful 
of nights, And chalked in large letters on a board, 
Be of good cheer, We will not desert you; How 
he saved the drifting company at last, How the lank 
loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of their 
prepared graves, How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted 
sick, and the sharp-lipped unshaved men; All this I swallow 
and it tastes good . . . . I like 
it well, and it becomes mine, I am the man 
. . . . I suffered . . . . 
I was there. The disdain and calmness of martyrs, The 
mother condemned for a witch and burnt with dry wood, 
and her children gazing on; The hounded slave that flags 
in the race and leans by the fence, blowing and 
covered with sweat, The twinges that sting like needles his 
legs and neck,The murderous buckshot and the bullets, All these 
I feel or am. I am the hounded slave . 
. . . I wince at the bite of the 
dogs, Hell and despair are upon me . . . 
. crack and again crack the marksmen, I clutch the 
rails of the fence . . . . my gore 
dribs thinned with the ooze of my skin, I fall 
on the weeds and stones, The riders spur their unwilling 
horses and haul close,They taunt my dizzy ears . . 
. . they beat me violently over the head with 
their whip-stocks. Agonies are one of my changes of garments; 
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels 
. . . . I myself become the wounded person,
