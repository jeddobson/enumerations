or plant, For him the revolving cycles truly and steadily 
rolled.In that head the allbaffling brain, In it and below 
it the making of the attributes of heroes. Examine these 
limbs, red black or white . . . . they 
are very cunning in tendon and nerve; They shall be 
stript that you may see them. Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, 
pluck, volition, Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh 
not flabby, goodsized arms and legs, And wonders within there 
yet. Within there runs his blood . . . . 
the same old blood . . the same red running 
blood; There swells and jets his heart . . . 
. There all passions and desires . . all reachings 
and aspirations: Do you think they are not there because 
they are not expressed in parlors and lecture-rooms? This is 
not only one man . . . . he is 
the father of those who shall be fathers in their 
turns, In him the start of populous states and rich 
republics,Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. 
How do you know who shall come from the offspring 
of his offspring through the centuries? Who might you find 
you have come from yourself if you could trace back 
through the centuries? A woman at auction, She too is 
not only herself . . . . she is the 
teeming mother of mothers, She is the bearer of them 
that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. Her 
daughters or their daughters' daughters . . who knows who 
shall mate with them? Who knows through the centuries what 
heroes may come from them? In them and of them 
natal love . . . . in them the divine 
mystery . . . . the same old beautiful mystery.
