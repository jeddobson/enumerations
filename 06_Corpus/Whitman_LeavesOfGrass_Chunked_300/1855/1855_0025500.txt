the dim night is beautiful, The wildest and bloodiest is 
over and all is peace. Peace is always beautiful, The 
myth of heaven indicates peace and night. The myth of 
heaven indicates the soul; The soul is always beautiful . 
. . . it appears more or it appears less 
. . . . it comes or lags behind, It 
comes from its embowered garden and looks pleasantly on itself 
and encloses the world; Perfect and clean the genitals previously 
jetting, and perfect and clean the womb cohering, The head 
wellgrown and proportioned and plumb, and the bowels and joints 
proportioned and plumb. The soul is always beautiful, The universe 
is duly in order . . . . every thing 
is in its place, What is arrived is in its 
place, and what waits is in its place; The twisted 
skull waits . . . . the watery or rotten 
blood waits, The child of the glutton or venerealee waits 
long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and 
the drunkard himself waits long, The sleepers that lived and 
died wait . . . . the far advanced are 
to go on in their turns, and the far behind 
are to go on in their turns, The diverse shall 
be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite 
. . . . they unite now. The sleepers are 
very beautiful as they lie unclothed,They flow hand in hand 
over the whole earth from east to west as they 
lie un- clothed; The Asiatic and African are hand in 
hand . . . . the European and American are 
hand in hand, Learned and unlearned are hand in hand 
. . and male and female are hand in hand; 
The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast
