of her lover . . . . they press close 
without lust . . . . his lips press her

the son holds the father in his arms with measureless 
love, The white hair of the mother shines on the

slave is one with the master's call . . and 
the master salutes the slave, The felon steps forth from 
the prison . . . . the insane becomes sane 
. . . . the suffer- ing of sick persons 
is relieved, The sweatings and fevers stop . . the 
throat that was unsound is sound . . the lungs 
of the consumptive are resumed . . the poor distressed 
head is free, The joints of the rheumatic move as 
smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever, Stiflings and passages

swelled and convulsed and congested awake to themselves in condition, 
They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry 
of the night and awake. I too pass from the 
night; I stay awhile away O night, but I return 
to you again and love you; Why should I be 
afraid to trust myself to you? I am not afraid 
. . . . I have been well brought forward 
by you; I love the rich running day, but I 
do not desert her in whom I lay so long;
