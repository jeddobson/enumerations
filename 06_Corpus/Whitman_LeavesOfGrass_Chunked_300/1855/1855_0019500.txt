. . . . nor those of the men's chorus, 
nor those of the women's chorus, It is nearer and 
farther than they. Will the whole come back then? Can 
each see the signs of the best by a look 
in the lookingglass? Is there nothing greater or more? Does 
all sit there with you and here with me? The 
old forever new things . . . . you foolish 
child! . . . . the closest simplest things— this 
moment with you, Your person and every particle that relates 
to your person, The pulses of your brain waiting their 
chance and encouragement at every deed or sight; Anything you 
do in public by day, and anything you do in 
secret betweendays, What is called right and what is called 
wrong . . . . what you behold or touch 
. . . . what causes your anger or wonder, 
The anklechain of the slave, the bed of the bedhouse, 
the cards of the gambler, the plates of the forger; 
What is seen or learned in the street, or intuitively 
learned, What is learned in the public school—spelling, reading, writing 
and ciphering . . . . the blackboard and the 
teacher's diagrams: The panes of the windows and all that 
appears through them . . . . the going forth 
in the morning and the aimless spending of the day; 
(What is it that you made money? what is it 
that you got what you wanted?)The usual routine . . 
. . the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk; 
The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of 
hunting or fishing, Pasturelife, foddering, milking and herding, and all 
the personnel and usages; The plum-orchard and apple-orchard . . 
. . gardening . . seedlings, cuttings, flowers and vines,
