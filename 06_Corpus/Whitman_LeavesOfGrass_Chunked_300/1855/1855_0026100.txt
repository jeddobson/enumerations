I know not how I came of you, and I 
know not where I go with you . . . 
. but I know I came well and shall go 
well. I will stop only a time with the night 
. . . . and rise betimes. I will duly 
pass the day O my mother and duly return to 
you; Not you will yield forth the dawn again more 
surely than you will yield forth me again, Not the 
womb yields the babe in its time more surely than 
I shall be yielded from you in my time. Leaves 
of Grass.THE bodies of men and women engirth me, and 
I engirth them, They will not let me off nor 
I them till I go with them and respond to 
them and love them. Was it dreamed whether those who 
corrupted their own live bodies could conceal themselves? And whether 
those who defiled the living were as bad as they 
who defiled the dead? The expression of the body of 
man or woman balks account,The male is perfect and that 
of the female is perfect.The expression of a wellmade man 
appears not only in his face, It is in his 
limbs and joints also . . . . it is 
curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, It 
is in his walk . . the carriage of his 
neck . . the flex of his waist and knees 
. . . . dress does not hide him, The 
strong sweet supple quality he has strikes through the cotton 
and flannel; To see him pass conveys as much as 
the best poem . . perhaps more, You linger to 
see his back and the back of his neck and 
shoulderside. The sprawl and fulness of babes . . .
