merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,To 
touch my person to some one else's is about as 
much as I can stand. Is this then a touch? 
. . . . quivering me to a new identity, 
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, Treacherous 
tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,My flesh 
and blood playing out lightning, to strike what is hardly 
different from myself, On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my 
limbs, Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld 
drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, Depriving me of 
my best as for a purpose, Unbuttoning my clothes and 
holding me by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the 
calm of the sunlight and pasture fields, Immodestly sliding the 
fellow-senses away, They bribed to swap off with touch, and 
go and graze at the edges of me, No consideration, 
no regard for my draining strength or my anger, Fetching 
the rest of the herd around to enjoy them awhile, 
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry 
me.The sentries desert every other part of me, They have 
left me helpless to a red marauder, They all come 
to the headland to witness and assist against me. I 
am given up by traitors; I talk wildly . . 
. . I have lost my wits . . . 
. I and nobody else am the greatest traitor, I 
went myself first to the headland . . . . 
my own hands carried me there. You villain touch! what 
are you doing? . . . . my breath is 
tight in its throat; Unclench your floodgates! you are too 
much for me. Blind loving wrestling touch! Sheathed hooded sharptoothed 
touch! Did it make you ache so leaving me? Parting
