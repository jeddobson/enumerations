whirling and whirling is elemental within me. Somehow I have 
been stunned. Stand back! Give me a little time beyond 
my cuffed head and slumbers and dreams and gaping, I 
discover myself on a verge of the usual mistake. That 
I could forget the mockers and insults! That I could 
forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons 
and hammers! That I could look with a separate look 
on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning! I remember . 
. . . I resume the overstaid fraction, The grave 
of rock multiplies what has been confided to it . 
. . . or to any graves, The corpses rise 
. . . . the gashes heal . . . 
. the fastenings roll away. I troop forth replenished with 
supreme power, one of an average unending procession, We walk 
the roads of Ohio and Massachusetts and Virginia and Wisconsin 
and New York and New Orleans and Texas and Montreal 
and San Francisco and Charleston and Savannah and Mexico, Inland 
and by the seacoast and boundary lines . . . 
. and we pass the boundary lines. Our swift ordinances 
are on their way over the whole earth, The blossoms 
we wear in our hats are the growth of two 
thousand years. Eleves I salute you, I see the approach 
of your numberless gangs . . . . I see 
you understand yourselves and me, And know that they who 
have eyes are divine, and the blind and lame are 
equally divine, And that my steps drag behind yours yet 
go before them,And are aware how I am with you 
no more than I am with everybody. The friendly and 
flowing savage . . . . Who is he? Is 
he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it?
