any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor one of 
the myriads of myriads that in- habit them, Nor the 
present, nor the least wisp that is known. It is 
time to explain myself . . . . let us 
stand up.What is known I strip away . . . 
. I launch all men and women forward with me 
into the unknown. The clock indicates the moment . .

bottomless reservoirs . . . . its buckets are rising 
forever and ever, They pour and they pour and they 
exhale away. We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters 
and summers; There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of

will bring us richness and variety. I do not call

and place is equal to any.Were mankind murderous or jealous 
upon you my brother or my sister? I am sorry 
for you . . . . they are not murderous 
or jealous upon me; All has been gentle with me 
. . . . . . I keep no account 
with lamentation; What have I to do with lamentation? I 
am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser 
of things to be. My feet strike an apex of 
the apices of the stairs, On every step bunches of 
ages, and larger bunches between the steps, All below duly 
traveledâ€”and still I mount and mount.Rise after rise bow the 
phantoms behind me, Afar down I see the huge first 
Nothing, the vapor from the nostrils of death, I know 
I was even there . . . . I waited 
unseen and always, And slept while God carried me through
