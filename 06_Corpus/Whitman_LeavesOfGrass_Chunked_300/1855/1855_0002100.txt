stones is visible? What groans of overfed or half-starved who 
fall on the flags sunstruck or in fits, What exclamations 
of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth 
to babes, What living and buried speech is always vibrating 
here . . . . what howls restrained by decorum, 
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with 
convex lips, I mind them or the resonance of them 
. . . . I come again and again. The 
big doors of the country-barn stand open and readyThe dried 
grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon, The clear 
light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged, The 
armfuls are packed to the sagging mow: I am there 
. . . . I help . . . . 
I came stretched atop of the load, I felt its 
soft jolts . . . . one leg reclined on 
the other, I jump from the crossbeams, and seize the 
clover and timothy, And roll head over heels, and tangle 
my hair full of wisps. Alone far in the wilds 
and mountains I hunt, Wandering amazed at my own lightness 
and glee, In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot 
to pass the night, Kindling a fire and broiling the 
freshkilled game, Soundly falling asleep on the gathered leaves, my 
dog and gun by my side. The Yankee clipper is 
under her three skysails . . . . she cuts 
the sparkle and scud, My eyes settle the land . 
. . . I bend at her prow or shout 
joyously from the deck. The boatmen and clamdiggers arose early 
and stopped for me, I tucked my trowser-ends in my 
boots and went and had a good time, You should 
have been with us that day round the chowder- kettle.
