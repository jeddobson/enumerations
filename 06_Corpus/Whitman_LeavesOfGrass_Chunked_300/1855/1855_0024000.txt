I feel ashamed to go naked about the world, And 
am curious to know where my feet stand . . 
. . and what is this flooding me, childhood or 
manhood . . . . and the hunger that crosses 
the bridge between. The cloth laps a first sweet eating 
and drinking, Laps life-swelling yolks . . . . laps 
ear of rose-corn, milky and just ripened: The white teeth 
stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness, And liquor is 
spilled on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the 
best liquor afterward. I descend my western course . . 
. . my sinews are flaccid, Perfume and youth course 
through me, and I am their wake.It is my face 
yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's, I sit 
low in a strawbottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's 
stockings. It is I too . . . . the 
sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight, I see 
the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth. 
A shroud I seeâ€”and I am the shroud . . 
. . I wrap a body and lie in the 
coffin; It is dark here underground . . . . 
it is not evil or pain here . . . 
. it is blank here, for reasons. It seems to 
me that everything in the light and air ought to 
be happy; Whoever is not in his coffin and the 
dark grave, let him know he has enough. I see 
a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of 
the sea, His brown hair lies close and even to 
his head . . . . he strikes out with 
courageous arms . . . . he urges himself with 
his legs. I see his white body . . .
