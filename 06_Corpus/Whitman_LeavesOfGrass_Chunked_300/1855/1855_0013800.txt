on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit 
by him while he is tried for forgery: What was 
strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, 
and not filling the square rod then; The bull and 
the bug never worshipped half enough, Dung and dirt more 
admirable than was dreamed, The supernatural of no account . 
. . . myself waiting my time to be one 
of the supremes, The day getting ready for me when 
I shall do as much good as the best, and 
be as prodigious, Guessing when I am it will not 
tickle me much to receive puffs out of pulpit or 
print; By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator! Putting myself 
here and now to the ambushed womb of the shadows! 
. . . . A call in the midst of 
the crowd,My own voice, orotund sweeping and final. Come my 
children, Come my boys and girls, and my women and 
household and intimates, Now the performer launches his nerve . 
. . . he has passed his prelude on the 
reeds within. Easily written loosefingered chords! I feel the thrum 
of their climax and close. My head evolves on my 
neck, Music rolls, but not from the organ . . 
. . folks are around me, but they are no 
household of mine. Ever the hard and unsunk ground, Ever 
the eaters and drinkers . . . . ever the 
upward and downward sun . . . . ever the 
air and the ceaseless tides, Ever myself and my neighbors, 
refreshing and wicked and real, Ever the old inexplicable query 
. . . . ever that thorned thumbâ€”that breath of 
itches and thirsts, Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we 
find where the sly one hides and bring him forth;
