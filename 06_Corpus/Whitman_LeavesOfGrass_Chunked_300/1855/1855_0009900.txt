cow waits in the hovel, Where the bull advances to 
do his masculine work, and the stud to the mare, 
and the cock is treading the hen, Where the heifers 
browse, and the geese nip their food with short jerks; 
Where the sundown shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome 
prairie, Where the herds of buffalo make a crawling spread 
of the square miles far and near; Where the hummingbird 
shimmers . . . . where the neck of the 
longlived swan is curving and winding; Where the laughing-gull scoots 
by the slappy shore and laughs her near-human laugh; Where 
beehives range on a gray bench in the garden half- 
hid by the high weeds; Where the band-necked partridges roost 
in a ring on the ground with their heads out; 
Where burial coaches enter the arched gates of a cemetery; 
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled 
trees; Where the yellow-crowned heron comes to the edge of 
the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs; Where 
the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon; 
Where the katydid works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree 
over the well; Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with 
silver-wired leaves, Through the salt-lick or orange glade . . 
. . or under conical furs; Through the gymnasium . 
. . . through the curtained saloon . . . 
. through the office or public hall; Pleased with the 
native and pleased with the foreign . . . . 
pleased with the new and old, Pleased with women, the 
homely as well as the handsome,Pleased with the quakeress as 
she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously, Pleased with 
the primitive tunes of the choir of the whitewashed church, 
Pleased with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,
