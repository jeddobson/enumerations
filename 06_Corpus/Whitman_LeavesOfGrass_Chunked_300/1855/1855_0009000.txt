forever, Gathering and showing more always and with velocity, Infinite 
and omnigenous and the like of these among them;Not too 
exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers, Picking out here 
one that shall be my amie, Choosing to go with 
him on brotherly terms. A gigantic beauty of a stallion, 
fresh and responsive to my caresses, Head high in the 
forehead and wide between the ears, Limbs glossy and supple, 
tail dusting the ground, Eyes well apart and full of 
sparkling wickedness . . . . ears finely cut and 
flexibly moving. His nostrils dilate . . . . my 
heels embrace him . . . . his well built 
limbs tremble with pleasure . . . . we speed 
around and return. I but use you a moment and 
then I resign you stallion . . . . and 
do not need your paces, and outgallop them, And myself 
as I stand or sit pass faster than you. Swift 
wind! Space! My Soul! Now I know it is true 
what I guessed at; What I guessed when I loafed 
on the grass, What I guessed while I lay alone 
in my bed . . . . and again as 
I walked the beach under the paling stars of the 
morning. My ties and ballasts leave me . . . 
. I travel . . . . I sail . 
. . . my elbows rest in the sea-gaps, I 
skirt the sierras . . . . my palms cover 
continents,I am afoot with my vision. By the city's quadrangular 
houses . . . . in log-huts, or camping with 
lumbermen, Along the ruts of the turnpike . . . 
. along the dry gulch and rivulet bed, Hoeing my 
onion-patch, and rows of carrots and parsnips . . .
