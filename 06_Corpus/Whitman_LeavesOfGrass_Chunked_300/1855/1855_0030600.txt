elsewhere with unslaughter'd vitality. They live in other young men, 
O kings, They live in brothers, again ready to defy 
you: They were purified by death . . . . 
They were taught and exalted. Not a grave of the 
murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom . . 
. . in its turn to bear seed, Which the 
winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the 
snows nourish. Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of 
tyrants let loose, But it stalks invisibly over the earth 
. . whispering counseling cautioning. Liberty let others despair of 
you . . . . I never despair of you. 
Is the house shut? Is the master away? Nevertheless be 
ready . . . . be not weary of watching,He 
will soon return . . . . his messengers come 
anon. CLEAR the way there Jonathan! Way for the President's 
marshal! Way for the government cannon! Way for the federal 
foot and dragoons . . . . and the phantoms 
afterward. I rose this morning early to get betimes in 
Boston town;Here's a good place at the corner . . 
. . I must stand and see the show. I 
love to look on the stars and stripes . . 
. . I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle. 
How bright shine the foremost with cutlasses, Every man holds 
his revolver . . . . marching stiff through Boston 
town. A fog follows . . . . antiques of 
the same come limping,Some appear wooden-legged and some appear bandaged 
and bloodless. Why this is a show! It has called 
the dead out of the earth, The old graveyards of 
the hills have hurried to see; Uncountable phantoms gather by 
flank and rear of it, Cocked hats of mothy mould
