to be loosened. I swear I will never mention love 
or death inside a house, And I swear I never 
will translate myself at all, only to him or her 
who privately stays with me in the open air. If 
you would understand me go to the heights or water- 
shore, The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop 
or the motion of waves a key, The maul the 
oar and the handsaw second my words. No shuttered room 
or school can commune with me, But roughs and little 
children better than they. The young mechanic is closest to 
me . . . . he knows me pretty well, 
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him 
shall take me with him all day, The farmboy ploughing 
in the field feels good at the sound of my 
voice, In vessels that sail my words must sail . 
. . . I go with fishermen and seamen, and 
love them, My face rubs to the hunter's face when 
he lies down alone in his blanket, The driver thinking 
of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon, 
The young mother and old mother shall comprehend me, The 
girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and 
forget where they are, They and all would resume what 
I have told them. I have said that the soul 
is not more than the body, And I have said 
that the body is not more than the soul,And nothing, 
not God, is greater to one than one's-self is, And 
whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own 
funeral, dressed in his shroud, And I or you pocketless 
of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, 
And to glance with an eye or show a bean
