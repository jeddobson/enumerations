roots of the garden, And the appletrees covered with blossoms, 
and the fruit afterward . . . . and wood- 
berries . . and the commonest weeds by the road; 
And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of 
the tavern whence he had lately risen, And the schoolmistress 
that passed on her way to the school . . 
and the friendly boys that passed . . and the 
quarrelsome boys . . and the tidy and freshcheeked girls 
. . and the barefoot negro boy and girl, And 
all the changes of city and country wherever he went.His 
own parents . . he that had propelled the fatherstuff 
at night, and fathered him . . and she that 
conceived him in her womb and birthed him . . 
. . they gave this child more of themselves than 
that, They gave him afterward every day . . . 
. they and of them became part of him. The 
mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the suppertable, 
The mother with mild words . . . . clean 
her cap and gown . . . . a wholesome 
odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks 
by: The father, strong, selfsufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust, The 
blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty 
lure, The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture 
. . . . the yearning and swelling heart, Affection 
that will not be gainsayed . . . . The 
sense of what is real . . . . the 
thought if after all it should prove unreal, The doubts 
of daytime and the doubts of nighttime . . . 
the curious whether and how, Whether that which appears so 
is so . . . . Or is it all
