brother of my own, And that all the men ever 
born are also my brothers . . . . and 
the women my sisters and lovers, And that a kelson 
of the creation is love; And limitless are leaves stiff 
or drooping in the fields,And brown ants in the little 
wells beneath them, And mossy scabs of the wormfence, and 
heaped stones, and elder and mullen and pokeweed. A child 
said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with 
full hands; How could I answer the child? . . 
. . I do not know what it is any 
more than he. I guess it must be the flag 
of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. Or 
I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A 
scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped, Bearing the owner's name 
someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, 
and say Whose? Or I guess the grass is itself 
a child . . . . the produced babe of 
the vegetation. Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, 
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow 
zones, Growing among black folks as among white, Kanuck, Tuckahoe, 
Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them 
the same. And now it seems to me the beautiful 
uncut hair of graves. Tenderly will I use you curling 
grass, It may be you transpire from the breasts of 
young men,It may be if I had known them I 
would have loved them;It may be you are from old 
people and from women, and from offspring taken soon out 
of their mothers' laps, And here you are the mothers' 
laps. This grass is very dark to be from the 
white heads of old mothers, Darker than the colorless beards
