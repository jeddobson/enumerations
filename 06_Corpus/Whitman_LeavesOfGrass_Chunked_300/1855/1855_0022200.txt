the pleasure from poems; The domestic joys, the daily housework 
or business, the building of houses—they are not phantasms . 
. they have weight and form and location; The farms 
and profits and crops . . the markets and wages 
and government . . they also are not phantasms; The 
difference between sin and goodness is no apparition;The earth is 
not an echo . . . . man and his 
life and all the things of his life are well- 
considered. You are not thrown to the winds . . 
you gather certainly and safely around yourself, Yourself! Yourself! Yourself 
forever and ever! It is not to diffuse you that 
you were born of your mother and father—it is to 
identify you, It is not that you should be undecided, 
but that you should be decided; Something long preparing and 
formless is arrived and formed in you, You are thenceforth 
secure, whatever comes or goes. The threads that were spun 
are gathered . . . . the weft crosses the 
warp . . . . the pattern is systematic. The 
preparations have every one been justified; The orchestra have tuned 
their instruments sufficiently . . . . the baton has 
given the signal. The guest that was coming . . 
. . he waited long for reasons . . . 
. he is now housed, He is one of those 
who are beautiful and happy . . . . he 
is one of those that to look upon and be 
with is enough. The law of the past cannot be 
eluded. The law of the present and future cannot be 
eluded, The law of the living cannot be eluded . 
. . . it is eternal, The law of promotion 
and transformation cannot be eluded,The law of heroes and good-doers
