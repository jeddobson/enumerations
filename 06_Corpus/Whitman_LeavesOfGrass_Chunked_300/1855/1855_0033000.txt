quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes, 
It is inevitably in the man . . . . 
He and it are in love, and never leave each 
other. The truth in man is no dictum . . 
. . it is vital as eyesight, If there be 
any soul there is truth . . . . if 
there be man or woman there is truth . . 
. . If there be physical or moral there is 
truth, If there be equilibrium or volition there is truth 
. . . . if there be things at all 
upon the earth there is truth. O truth of the 
earth! O truth of things! I am determined to press 
the whole way toward you, Sound your voice! I scale 
mountains or dive in the sea after you. Great is 
language . . . . it is the mightiest of 
the sciences, It is the fulness and color and form 
and diversity of the earth . . . . and 
of men and women . . . . and of 
all qualities and processes; It is greater than wealth . 
. . . it is greater than buildings or ships 
or religions or paintings or music. Great is the English 
speech . . . . What speech is so great 
as the English? Great is the English brood . . 
. . What brood has so vast a destiny as 
the English? It is the mother of the brood that 
must rule the earth with the new rule, The new 
rule shall rule as the soul rules, and as the 
love and justice and equality that are in the soul 
rule. Great is the law . . . . Great 
are the old few landmarks of the law . .
