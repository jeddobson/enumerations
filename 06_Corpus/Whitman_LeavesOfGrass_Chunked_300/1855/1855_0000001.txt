I CELEBRATE myself, And what I assume you shall assume, 
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to 
you.I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe 
at my ease . . . . observing a spear 
of summer grass. Houses and rooms are full of perfumes 
. . . . the shelves are crowded with perfumes, 
I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like 
it,The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not 
let it. The atmosphere is not a perfume . . 
. . it has no taste of the distillation . 
. . . it is odorless, It is for my 
mouth forever . . . . I am in love 
with it,I will go to the bank by the wood 
and become undisguised and naked, I am mad for it 
to be in contact with me. The smoke of my 
own breath, Echos, ripples, and buzzed whispers . . . 
. loveroot, silkthread, crotch and vine, My respiration and inspiration 
. . . . the beating of my heart . 
. . . the passing of blood and air through 
my lungs, The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, 
and of the shore and darkcolored sea- rocks, and of 
hay in the barn, The sound of the belched words 
of my voice . . . . words loosed to 
the eddies of the wind, A few light kisses . 
. . . a few embraces . . . . 
a reaching around of arms, The play of shine and 
shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, The 
delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or 
along the fields and hillsides, The feeling of health . 
. . . the full-noon trill . . . .
