not yours as much as mine they are nothing or 
next to nothing, If they do not enclose everything they 
are next to nothing, If they are not the riddle 
and the untying of the riddle they are nothing, If 
they are not just as close as they are distant 
they are nothing. This is the grass that grows wherever 
the land is and the water is, This is the 
common air that bathes the globe. This is the breath 
of laws and songs and behaviour, This is the the 
tasteless water of souls . . . . this is 
the true sustenance, It is for the illiterate . . 
. . it is for the judges of the supreme 
court . . . . it is for the federal 
capitol and the state capitols, It is for the admirable 
communes of literary men and composers and singers and lecturers 
and engineers and savans, It is for the endless races 
of working people and farmers and seamen. This is the 
trill of a thousand clear cornets and scream of the 
octave flute and strike of triangles. I play not a 
march for victors only . . . . I play 
great marches for conquered and slain persons. Have you heard 
that it was good to gain the day? I also 
say it is good to fall . . . . 
battles are lost in the same spirit in which they 
are won. I sound triumphal drums for the dead . 
. . . I fling through my embouchures the loudest 
and gayest music to them, Vivas to those who have 
failed, and to those whose war- vessels sank in the 
sea, and those themselves who sank in the sea, And 
to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes,
