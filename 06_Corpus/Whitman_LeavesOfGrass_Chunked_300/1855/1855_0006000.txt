as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other. You 
sea! I resign myself to you also . . .

the poet of wick- edness also. Washes and razors for 
foofoos . . . . for me freckles and a

all that has grown. Did you fear some scrofula out 
of the unflagging pregnancy? Did you guess the celestial laws
