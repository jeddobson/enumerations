anything I have I bestow.259 I do not ask who 
you are—that is not so important to me;You can do 
nothing, and be nothing, but what I will infold you.260 
To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean;On his 
right cheek I put the family kiss,And in my soul 
I swear, I never will deny him.261 On women fit 
for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes;(This day I 
am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)262 To 
any one dying—thither I speed, and twist the knob of 
the door;Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed;Let 
the physician and the priest go home.263 I seize the 
descending man, and raise him with re- sistless will.264 O 
despairer, here is my neck;By God! you shall not go

with tremendous breath—I buoy you up;Every room of the house 
do I fill with an arm'd force,Lovers of me, bafflers 
of graves.266 Sleep! I and they keep guard all night;Not 
doubt—not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you;I have 
embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself;And when you 
rise in the mornng you will find what I tell 
you is so.41267 I am he bringing help for the 
sick as they pant on their backs;And for strong upright 
men I bring yet more needed help.268 I heard what 
was said of the universe;Heard it and heard it of 
several thousand years:It is middling well as far as it 
goes,—But is that all?269 Magnifying and applying come I,Outbidding at 
the start the old cautious hucksters,Taking myself the exact dimensions 
of Jehovah,Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson;Buying 
drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,In my portfolio placing 
Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,With Odin,
