then?If they had not reference to you in especial, what 
were they then?31 I swear I will never henceforth have 
to do with the faith that tells the best!I will 
have to do only with that faith that leaves the 
best untold.1632 Say on, sayers!Delve! mould! pile the words of

yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies be- neath me;It 
shall yet stand up the soldier of unquestion'd victory. LEAVES

the way there, Jonathan!Way for the President's marshal! Way for 
the govern- ment cannon!Way for the Federal foot and dragoons—and 
the appa- ritions copiously tumbling.3 I love to look on 
the stars and stripes—I hope the fifes will play Yankee 
Doodle.4 How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!Every
