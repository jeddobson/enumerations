into me as I absorb food, air—to appear again in 
my strength, gait, face?Have real employments contributed to it? original 
makers—not mere amanuenses?Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, faces, face 
to face?What does it mean to me? to American persons, 
pro- gresses, cities? Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian, 
native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?Does it encompass 
all The States, and the unexcep- tional rights of all 
the men and woman of the earth? (the genital impulse 
of These States;)Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the 
real custodians, standing, menacing, silent—the me- chanics, Manhattanese, western men, 
southerners, significant alike in their apathy, and in the promptness 
of their love?Does it see what finally befalls, and has 
always finally befallen, each temporizer, patcher, outsider, par- tialist, alarmist, 
infidel, who has ever ask'd any- thing of America?What mocking 
and scornful negligence?The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;By 
the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.1341 Rhymes and rhymers pass away—poems 
distill'd from foreign poems pass away,The swarms of reflectors and 
the polite pass, and leave ashes;Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make 
but the soil of literature;America justifies itself, give it time—no 
disguise can deceive it, or conceal from it—it is impassive 
enough,Only towards the likes of itself will it advance to 
meet them,If its poets appear, it will in due time 
advance to meet them—there is no fear of mistake,(The proof 
of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country 
absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)42 He 
masters whose spirit masters—he tastes sweetest who results sweetest in 
the long run;The blood of the brawn beloved of time 
is unconstraint;In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, 
an appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she 
is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical ex- ample.43
