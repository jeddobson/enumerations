millions of distinct families, and the same number of dwellings—Always 
these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches;Always the free 
range and diversity! always the conti- nent of Democracy!Always the 
prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, trav- elers, Kanada, the snows;Always 
these compact lands—lands tied at the hips with the belt 
stringing the huge oval lakes;Always the West, with strong native 
persons—the in- creasing density there—the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning

the bells all strike midnight together;In primitive woods, the sounds 
there also sounding— the howl of the wolf, the scream 
of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk;In 
winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake —in 
summer visible through the clear waters, the great trout swimming;In 
lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the large 
black buzzard floating slowly, high beyond the tree tops,Below, the
