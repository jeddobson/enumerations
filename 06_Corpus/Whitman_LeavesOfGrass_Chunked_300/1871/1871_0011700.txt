tokens of myself—they evince them plainly in their possession.190 I 
wonder where they get those tokens:Did I pass that way 
huge times ago, and negligently drop them?Myself moving forward then 
and now and forever,Gathering and showing more always and with 
velocity,Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them;Not 
too exclusive toward the reachers of my remem- brancers;Picking out 
here one that I love, and now go with him 
on brotherly terms.191 A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh

my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips—crossing savannas—trailing 
in forests;Prospecting—gold-digging—girdling the trees of a new purchase;Scorch'd ankle-deep by 
the hot sand—hauling my boat down the shallow river;Where the 
panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead —where 
the buck turns furiously at the hunter;Where the rattlesnake suns
