this day.162 My final merit I refuse you—I refuse putting 
from me what I really am;Encompass worlds, but never try 
to encompass me;I crowd your sleekest and best by simply 
looking to- ward you.163 Writing and talk do not prove 
me;I carry the plenum of proof, and everything else, in 
my face;With the hush of my lips I wholly confound 
the skep- tic.26164 I think I will do nothing now 
but listen,To accrue what I hear into myself—to let sounds 
con- tribute toward me.165 I hear bravuras of birds, bustle

of ap- proaching cars;The slow-march play'd at the head of 
the association, marching two and two;(They go to guard some 
corpse—the flag tops are draped with black muslin.)166 I hear 
the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint;)I hear the 
key'd cornet—it glides quickly in through my ears;It shakes mad-sweet 
pangs through my belly and breast.167 I hear the chorus—it 
is a grand opera;Ah, this indeed is music! This suits 
me.168 A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills 
me;The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling
