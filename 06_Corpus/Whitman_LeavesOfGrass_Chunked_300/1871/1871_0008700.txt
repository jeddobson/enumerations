remains at the end but threadbare crape, and tears.96 Whimpering 
and truckling fold with powders for invalids—conformity goes to the 
fourth-remov'd;I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out.97 
Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be 
ceremonious?98 Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, 
counsell'd with doctors, and calculated close,I find no sweeter fat

at what you call dissolution;And I know the amplitude of 
time.21106 I am the poet of the Body;And I am 
the poet of the Soul.107 The pleasures of heaven are
