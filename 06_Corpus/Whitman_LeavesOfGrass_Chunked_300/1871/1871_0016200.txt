and centrifugal gang, I turn and talk, like a man 
leaving charges before a journey.283 Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded,Frivolous, 
sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical;I know every one of 
you—I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.284 
How the flukes splash!How they contort, rapid as lightning, with 
spasms, and spouts of blood!285 Be at peace, bloody flukes

of the earth,Nor anything in the myriads of spheres—nor one 
of the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,Nor the present—nor 
the least wisp that is known.44289 It is time to 
explain myself—Let us stand up.290 What is known I strip 
away;I launch all men and women forward with me into 
THE UNKNOWN.291 The clock indicates the moment—but what does eter-
