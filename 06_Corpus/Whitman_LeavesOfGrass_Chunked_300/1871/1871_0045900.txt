THE MYTHS.11 GREAT are the myths—I too delight in them;Great 
are Adam and Eve—I too look back and accept them;Great 
the risen and fallen nations and their poets, women, sages, 
inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests.2 Great is Liberty! great is 
Equality! I am their fol- lower;Helmsmen of nations, choose your 
craft! where you sail, I sail,I weather it out with 
you, or sink with you.3 Great is Youth—equally great is 
Old Age—great are the Day and Night;Great is Wealth—great is 
Poverty—great is Expression —great is Silence.4 Youth, large, lusty, loving—Youth, 
full of grace, force, fascination!Do you know that Old Age 
may come after you, with equal grace, force, fascination?5 Day, 
full-blown and splendid—Day of the immense sun, action, ambition, laughter,The 
Night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and 
restoring darkness.6 Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospi- 
tality;But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowl- edge, 
pride, enfolding love;(Who goes for men and women showing Poverty 
richer than wealth?)7 Expression of speech! in what is written 
or said, for -get not that Silence is also expressive,That 
anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold 
as the coldest, may be without words.28 Great is the 
Earth, and the way it became what it is;Do you 
imagine it has stopt at this? the increase aban- don'd?Understand 
then that it goes as far onward from this, as 
this is from the times when it lay in covering 
waters and gases, before man had appear'd.9 Great is the 
quality of Truth in man;The quality of truth in man 
supports itself through all changes,It is inevitably in the man—he 
and it are in love, and never leave each other.10
