things more beautiful than words can tell.32 Allons! we must 
not stop here!However sweet these laid-up stores—however conve- nient this 
dwelling, we cannot remain here;However shelter'd this port, and however 
calm these waters, we must not anchor here;However welcome the

satisfaction, before you are call'd by an irresistible call to 
depart,You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mock-

you receive, you shall only answer with passionate kisses of 
parting,You shall not allow the hold of those who spread
