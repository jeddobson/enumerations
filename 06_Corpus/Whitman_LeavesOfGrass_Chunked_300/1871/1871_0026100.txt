happy;But the day when I rose at dawn from the 
bed of per- fect health, refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe 
breath of autumn,When I saw the full moon in the 
west grow pale and disappear in the morning light,When I 
wander'd alone over the beach, and undress- ing, bathed, laughing 
with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,And when

roll slowly continually up the shores,I heard the hissing rustle

to congratulate me,For the one I love most lay sleeping 
by me under the same cover in the cool night,In 
the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined 
toward me,And his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that 
night I was happy. Are You the New Person drawn

me?Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground to- ward 
a real heroic man?Have you no thought, O dreamer, that 
it may be all maya, illusion? Roots and Leaves Themselves 
Alone.ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;Scents brought to men
