on unknown cur- rents,Where shells grow to her slimy deck—where 
the dead are corrupting below;Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne 
at the head of the regiments;Approaching Manhattan, up by the 
long-stretching island;Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over 
my countenance;Upon a door-step—upon the horse-block of hard wood outside;Upon 
the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good 
game of base-ball;At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, 
drinking, laughter;At the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown 
mash, sucking the juice through a straw;At apple-peelings, wanting kisses

bees, huskings, house-raisings:Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, 
screams, weeps;Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard—where the dry-stalks 
are scattered—where the brood-cow waits in the hovel;Where the bull 
advances to do his masculine work— where the stud to

browse—where geese nip their food with short jerks;Where sun-down shadows 
lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie;Where herds of buffalo 
make a crawling spread of the square miles far and 
near;Where the humming-bird shimmers—where the neck of the long-lived swan 
is curving and winding;Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, 
where she laughs her near-human laugh;Where bee-hives range on a 
gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high 
weeds;Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground 
with their heads out;Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates 
of a cemetery;Where winter wolves bark amidst wastes of snow 
and icicled trees;Where the yellow-crowned heron comes to the edge 
of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs;Where 
the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon;Where 
the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over 
the well:Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver- wired
