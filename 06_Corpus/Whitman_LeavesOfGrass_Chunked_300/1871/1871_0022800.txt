fulness and freedom!With one brief hour of madness and joy. 
WE TWO—HOW LONG WE WERE FOOL'D.WE two—how long we were 
fool'd!Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;We are Nature—long 
have we been absent, but now we return;We become plants, 
leaves, foliage, roots, bark;We are bedded in the ground—we are

impervious:We are snow, rain, cold, darkness—we are each product and 
influence of the globe;We have circled and circled till we 
have arrived home again—we two have;We have voided all but 
freedom, and all but our own joy. OUT OF THE 
ROLLING OCEAN, THE CROWD.1OUT of the rolling ocean, the crowd, 
came a drop gently to me,Whispering, I love you, before

to look on you, to touch you, For I could 
not die till I once look'd on you, For I 
fear'd I might afterwards lose you .2(Now we have met, 
we have look'd, we are safe;Return in peace to the 
ocean, my love;I too am part of that ocean, my 
love—we are not so much separated;Behold the great rondure—the cohesion
