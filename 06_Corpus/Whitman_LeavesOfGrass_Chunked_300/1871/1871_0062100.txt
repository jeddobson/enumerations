impregnable and swarming places,Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and the 
rest, are to be,Of what a few years will show 
there in Nebraska, Col- orado, Nevada, and the rest;(Of afar, 
mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska;)Of what the 
feuillage of America is the preparation for —and of what 
all sights, North, South, East and West, are;Of This Union, 
soak'd, welded in blood—of the solemn price paid—of the unnamed 
lost, ever present in my mind;—Of the temporary use of

great pastoral area, athletic and feminine,Of all sloping down there 
where the fresh free giver, the mother, the Mississippi flows,Of 
future women there—of happiness in those high plateaus, ranging three 
thousand miles, warm and cold;Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd, 
and unsus- pected, (as I am also, and as it 
must be;)Of the new and good names—of the modern develop- 
ments—of inalienable homesteads;Of a free and original life there—of simple 
diet and clean and sweet blood;Of litheness, majestic faces, clear 
eyes, and perfect physique there;Of immense spiritual results, future years, 
far west, each side of the Anahuacs;Of these leaves, well 
understood there, (being made for that area;)Of the native scorn 
of grossness and gain there;(O it lurks in me night 
and day—What is gain, after all, to savageness and freedom?) 
Song at Sunset.1 SPLENDOR of ended day, floating and filling 
me!Hour prophetic—hour resuming the past!Inflating my throat—you, divine average!You, Earth 
and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.2 Open 
mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,Eyes of my Soul, seeing
