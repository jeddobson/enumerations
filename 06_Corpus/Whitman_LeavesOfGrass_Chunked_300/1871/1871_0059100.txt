of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their 
prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one 
of those houses to destroy them;You thought not to destroy 
those valuable houses, standing fast, full of comfort, built with 
money;May they stand fast, then? Not an hour, except you, 
above them and all, stand fast;)—O banner! not money so 
precious are you, not farm produce you, nor the material 
good nutriment,Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the 
ships;Not the superb ships, with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and 
carrying cargoes,Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,—But you, as henceforth

cluster of stars, (ever-enlarging stars;)Divider of day-break you, cutting the 
air, touch'd by the sun, measuring the sky,(Passionately seen and 
yearn'd for by one poor little child,While others remain busy, 
or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift, thrift;)O you up there! 
O pennant! where you undulate like a snake, hissing so 
curious,Out of reach—an idea only—yet furiously fought for, risking bloody 
death—loved by me!So loved! O you banner leading the day, 
with stars brought from the night!Valueless, object of eyes, over 
all and demanding all— (absolute owner of ALL)—O banner and 
pennant!I too leave the rest—great as it is, it is 
nothing—houses, machines are nothing—I see them not;I see but you, 
O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I 
sing you only,Flapping up there in the wind. ETHIOPIA SALUTING 
THE COLORS.( A Reminiscence of 1864.)1WHO are you, dusky woman, 
so ancient, hardly human,With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and 
bare bony feet?Why, rising by the roadside here, do you 
the colors greet?2('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sand and 
pines,Forth from thy hovel door, thou, Ethiopia, com'st to me,As, 
under doughty Sherman, I march toward the sea.)3 Me, master,
