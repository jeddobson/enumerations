figure spreading a nimbus of gold-color'd light;But I paint myriads 
of heads, but paint no head with- out its nimbus 
of gold-color'd light;From my hand, from the brain of every 
man and woman it streams, effulgently flowing forever.6 O I 
could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!You have not 
known what you are—you have slumber'd upon yourself all your 
life;Your eye-lids have been the same as closed most of 
the time;What you have done returns already in mockeries;Your thrift, 
knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mockeries, what

or from yourself, they do not conceal you from me;The 
shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure com- plexion, if 
these balk others, they do not balk me,The pert apparel, 
the deform'd attitude, drunkenness, greed, premature death, all these I 
part aside.8 There is no endowment in man or woman 
that is not tallied in you;There is no virtue, no 
beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in 
you; SONGS OF PARTING. AS THE TIME DRAWS NIGH.11 As 
the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,A dread beyond, of

shall traverse The States awhile—but I cannot tell whither or 
how long;Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am 
singing, my voice will suddenly cease.23 O book, O chants! 
must all then amount to but this?Must we barely arrive 
at this beginning of us?… And yet it is enough, 
O soul!O soul! we have positively appear'd—that is enough. YEARS
