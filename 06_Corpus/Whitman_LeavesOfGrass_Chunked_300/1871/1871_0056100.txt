not why or what, yet weave, forever weave. LEAVES OF 
GRASS. THIS COMPOST.11 SOMETHING startles me where I thought I 
was safest;I withdraw from the still woods I loved;I will 
not go now on the pastures to walk;I will not 
strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover 
the sea;I will not touch my flesh to the earth,

pierces upward,The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,The resurrection of 
the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,The

carol mornings and evenings, while the birds sit on their 
nests,The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,The new-born 
of animals appear—the calf is dropt from the cow, the 
colt from the mare,Out of its little hill faithfully rise 
the potato's dark green leaves,Out of its hill rises the
