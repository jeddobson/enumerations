the farmer's wife singing;I hear in the distance the sounds 
of children, and of animals early in the day;I hear 
quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Ten- nessee and 
Kentucky, hunting on hills;I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing 
the wild horse;I hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, in 
the chestnut shade, to the rebeck and guitar;I hear continual 
echoes from the Thames;I hear fierce French liberty songs;I hear 
of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of old poems;I 
hear the Virginia plantation-chorus of negroes, of a harvest night, 
in the glare of pine-knots;I hear the strong baritone of 
the 'long-shore-men of Mannahatta;I hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, 
and singing;I hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary 
north- west lakes;I hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as 
they strike the grain and grass with the showers of 
their terrible clouds;I hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, pensively

the Nile;I hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams 
of Kanada;I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and 
the bells of the mule;I hear the Arab muezzin, calling 
from the top of the mosque;I hear the Christian priests 
at the altars of their churches—I hear the responsive base 
and soprano;I hear the wail of utter despair of the 
white-hair'd Irish grand-parents, when they learn the death of their 
grandson;I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's 
voice, putting to sea at Okotsk;I hear the wheeze of 
the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on—as the husky gangs 
pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together with wrist-chains 
and ankle-chains;I hear the entreaties of women tied up for 
punishment —I hear the sibilant whisk of thongs through the 
air;I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;I hear
