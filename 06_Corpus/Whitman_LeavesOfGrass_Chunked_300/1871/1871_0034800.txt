built for you.49 Allons! out of the dark confinement!It is 
useless to protest—I know all, and expose it.50 Behold, through 
you as bad as the rest,Through the laughter, dancing, dining, 
supping, of people,Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those 
wash'd and trimm'd faces,Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.51 
No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the 
confession;Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding 
it goes,Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, 
polite and bland in the parlors,In the cars of rail-roads, 
in steamboats, in the public assembly,Home to the houses of 
men and women, at the table, in the bed-room, everywhere,Smartly

under the skull-bones,Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons 
and artificial flowers,Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a 
syllable of itself,Speaking of anything else, but never of itself.

look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and 
upon all oppression and shame;I hear secret convulsive sobs from

children, dying, neglected, gaunt, desperate;I see the wife misused by 
her husband—I see the treacherous seducer of young women;I mark 
the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be 
hid—I see these sights on the earth;I see the workings 
of battle, pestilence, tyranny—I see martyrs and prisoners;I observe a 
famine at sea—I observe the sailors casting lots who shall 
be kill'd, to preserve the lives of the rest;I observe 
the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon laborers, 
the poor, and upon ne- groes, and the like;All these—All 
the meanness and agony without end, I sitting, look out
