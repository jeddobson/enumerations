not a record remains—And yet all remains.2 O I know 
that those men and women were not for nothing, any 
more than we are for nothing;I know that they belong 
to the scheme of the world every bit as much 
as we now belong to it, and as all will 
henceforth belong to it.3 Afar they stand—yet near to me 
they stand,Some with oval countenances, learn'd and calm,Some naked and 
savage—Some like huge collections of insects,Some in tents—herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes,

languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, 
slaves, heroes, poets, I suspect their results curiously await in 
the yet unseen world—coun- terparts of what accrued to them 
in the seen world,I suspect I shall meet them there,I 
suspect I shall there find each old particular of those 
unnamed lands. MANNAHATTA.1 I WAS asking for something specific and

I see what there is in a name, a word,
