sex,Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.4 
Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,I will go 
stay with her who waits for me, and with those 
women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me;I see that 
they understand me, and do not deny me;I see that 
they are worthy of me—I will be the robust husband 
of those women.5 They are not one jot less than 
I am,They are tann'd in the face by shining suns 
and blow- ing winds,Their flesh has the old divine suppleness 
and strength,They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, 
run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend them- selves,They are ultimate 
in their own right—they are calm, clear, well-possess'd of themselves.6 
I draw you close to me, you women!I cannot let 
you go, I would do you good,I am for you, 
and you are for me, not only for our own 
sake, but for others' sakes;Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes 
and bards,They refuse to awake at the touch of any 
man but me.7 It is I, you women—I make my 
way,I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable—but I love you,I do 
not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,I 
pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for 
These States—I press with slow rude muscle,I brace myself effectually—I 
listen to no entreaties,I dare not withdraw till I deposit 
what has so long accumulated within me.8 Through you I 
drain the pent-up rivers of myself,In you I wrap a 
thousand onward years,On you I graft the grafts of the 
best-beloved of me and America,The drops I distil upon you 
shall grow fierce and ath- letic girls, new artists, musicians, 
and singers,The babes I beget upon you are to beget 
babes in their turn,I shall demand perfect men and women
