his life, to be lost at any moment.)24 Revolt! and 
the downfall of tyrants!The battle rages with many a loud 
alarm, and frequent advance and retreat,The infidel triumphs—or supposes he 
triumphs,Then the prison, scaffold, garrote, hand-cuffs, iron neck- lace and 
anklet, lead-balls, do their work,The named and unnamed heroes pass 
to other spheres,The great speakers and writers are exiled—they lie

more memories of heroes and martyrs,And when all life, and 
all the souls of men and women are discharged from 
any part of the earth,Then only shall liberty, or the 
idea of liberty, be dis- charged from that part of 
the earth,And the infidel come into full possession.37 Then courage!

not know what I am for myself, nor what anything 
is for,)But I will search carefully for it even in 
being foil'd,In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment—for they too are great.9 
Revolt! and the bullet for tyrants!Did we think victory great?So 
it is—But now it seems to me, when it cannot 
be help'd, that defeat is great,And that death and dismay 
are great. FRANCE,The 18th Year of These States.11 A GREAT

the mother's heart closer than any yet.2 I walk'd the
