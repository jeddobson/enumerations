do to men in my own lands;O I know we 
should be brethren and lovers,I know I should be happy 
with them. I Hear it was Charged Against Me.I HEAR 
it was charged against me that I sought to de- 
stroy institutions;But really I am neither for nor against institutions;(What 
indeed have I in common with them?—Or what with the 
destruction of them?)Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and 
in every city of These States, inland and seaboard,And in

or the sea-beach dancing,Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, fee- 
bleness chasing,Fulfilling our foray. A PROMISE TO CALIFORNIA.A PROMISE to 
California,Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:Sojourning east 
a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain, 
to teach robust American love;For I know very well that
