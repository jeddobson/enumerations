the houses and ships have meaning!I will see if the 
fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, and 
I am not to be enough for my- self.2062 I 
match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,Copious

song.69 Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;(For the 
war, the war is over—the field is clear'd,)Till they strike 
up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,To cheer, O mother, your 
boundless, expectant soul.70 Bards grand as these days so grand!Bards 
of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inven- tions! 
(for the war, the war is over!)Yet Bards of the
