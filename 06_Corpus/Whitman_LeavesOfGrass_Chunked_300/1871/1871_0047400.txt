mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon—singing through the 
moon-lit night,The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;A 
Tennessee corn-field—the tall, graceful, long-leav'd corn—slender, flapping, bright green, with

when your own body will be dying.7 Think of spiritual 
results,Sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every 
one of its objects pass into spiritual results.8 Think of 
manhood, and you to be a man;Do you count manhood, 
and the sweet of manhood, nothing?9 Think of womanhood, and
