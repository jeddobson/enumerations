are perfect mira- cles, each as profound as any.46 I 
will not make poems with reference to parts;But I will 
make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with reference to 
ensemble:And I will not sing with reference to a day, 
but with reference to all days;And I will not make 
a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but 
has reference to the Soul;(Because, having look'd at the objects 
of the universe, I find there is no one, nor 
any particle of one, but has reference to the Soul.)1447

buried?49 Of your real body, and any man's or woman's

the corpse- cleaners, and pass to fitting spheres,Carrying what has 
accrued to it from the moment of birth to the 
moment of death.50 Not the types set up by the

Soul,Indifferently before death and after. death.51 Behold! the body includes 
and is the meaning, the main concern—and includes and is 
the Soul;Whoever you are! how superb and how divine is 
your body, or any part of it.1552 Whoever you are! 
to you endless announcements.53 Daughter of the lands, did you 
wait for your poet?Did you wait for one with a 
flowing mouth and indica- tive hand?54 Toward the male of 
The States, and toward the fe- male of The States,Live 
words—words to the lands.55 O the lands! interlink'd, food-yielding lands!Land
