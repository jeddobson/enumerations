SHIP STARTING.Lo! THE unbounded sea!On its breast a Ship starting, 
spreading all her sails— an ample Ship, carrying even her 
moonsails;The pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds 
so stately— below, emulous waves press forward,They surround the Ship, 
with shining curving motions, and foam. 28 UNFOLDED OUT OF 
THE FOLDS.UNFOLDED out of the folds of the woman, man 
comes unfolded, and is always to come unfolded;Unfolded only out 
of the superbest woman of the earth, is to come 
the superbest man of the earth;Unfolded out of the friendliest 
woman, is to come the friendliest man;Unfolded only out of 
the perfect body of a woman, can a man be 
form'd of perfect body;Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem 
of the wo- man can come the poems of man—(only 
thence have my poems come;)Unfolded out of the strong and 
arrogant woman I love, only thence can appear the strong 
and arrogant man I love;Unfolded by brawny embraces from the 
well-muscled woman I love, only thence come the brawny em- 
braces of the man;Unfolded out of the folds of the 
woman's brain, come all the folds of the man's brain, 
duly obedient;Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all 
justice is unfolded;Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman 
is all sym- pathy:A man is a great thing upon 
the earth, and through eternity—but every jot of the greatness 
of man is unfolded out of woman,First the man is 
shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in 
himself. 28 TO YOU.STRANGER! if you, passing, meet me, and 
desire to speak to me, why should you not speak 
to me?And why should I not speak to you? WALT 
WHITMAN.11 I CELEBRATE myself;And what I assume you shall assume;For 
every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.2
