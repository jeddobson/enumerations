chalk'd in large letters, on a board, Be of good 
cheer, we will not desert you :How he follow'd with 
them, and tack'd with them—and would not give it up;How 
he saved the drifting company at last:How the lank loose-gown'd 
women look'd when boated from the side of their prepared 
graves;How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and

lean on a cane and observe.210 I am the mash'd 
fireman with breast-bone broken;Tumbling walls buried me in their debris;Heat

comrades;I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;They 
have clear'd the beams away—they tenderly lift me forth.211 I 
lie in the night air in my red shirt—the pervading 
hush is for my sake;Painless after all I lie, exhausted
