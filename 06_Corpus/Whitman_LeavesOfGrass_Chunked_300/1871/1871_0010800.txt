me full.169 I hear the train'd soprano—(what work, with hers, 
is this?)The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies;It wrenches 
such ardors from me, I did not know I possess'd 
them;It sails me—I dab with bare feet—they are lick'd by 
the indolent waves;I am exposed, cut by bitter and angry 
hail—I lose my breath,Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throt- 
tled in fakes of death;At length let up again to 
feel the puzzle of puzzles,And that we call BEING.27170 To 
be, in any form—what is that?(Round and round we go, 
all of us, and ever come back thither;)If nothing lay 
more develop'd, the quahaug in its cal- lous shell were 
enough.171 Mine is no callous shell;I have instant conductors all 
over me, whether I pass or stop;They seize every object 
and lead it harmlessly through me.172 I merely stir, press, 
feel with my fingers, and am happy;To touch my person 
to some one else's is about as much as I 
can stand.28173 Is this then a touch? quivering me to 
a new iden- tity,Flames and ether making a rush for 
my veins,Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help 
them,My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what 
is hardly different from myself;On all sides prurient provokers stiffening 
my limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld 
drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,Depriving me of my 
best, as for a purpose,Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by 
the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of the 
sunlight and pasture-fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap 
off with touch, and go and graze at the edges 
of me;No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or 
my anger;Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy 
them a while,Then all uniting to stand on a headland
