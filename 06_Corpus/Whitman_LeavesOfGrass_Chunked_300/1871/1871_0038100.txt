true poems do not merely please,The true poets are not 
followers of beauty, but the august masters of beauty;The greatness 
of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers 
and fathers,The words of poems are the tuft and final 
applause of science.5 Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law 
of reason, health, rudeness of body, withdrawnness,Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness—such are

not seek beauty—they are sought,Forever touching them, or close upon 
them, follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick.3 They prepare for death—yet 
are they not the finish, but rather the outset,They bring 
none to his or her terminus, or to be con-

behold the birth of stars, to learn one of the 
meanings,To launch off with absolute faith—to sweep through the ceaseless 
rings, and never be quiet again. POETS TO COME.1 POETS

justify me, and answer what I am for;But you, a 
new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before known,Arouse! Arouse—for 
you must justify me—you must answer.2 I myself but write 
one or two indicative words for the future,I but advance 
a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the 
darkness.3 I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully 
stop- ping, turns a casual look upon you, and then 
averts his face,Leaving it to you to prove and define
