but not so unhappy;White and beautiful are the faces around 
me—the heads are bared of their fire-caps;The kneeling crowd fades 
with the light of the torches.212 Distant and dead resuscitate;They 
show as the dial or move as the hands of 
me— I am the clock myself.213 I am an old 
artillerist—I tell of my fort's bombard- ment;I am there again.214 
Again the long roll of the drummers;Again the attacking cannon, 
mortars;Again, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.215 I take 
part—I see and hear the whole;The cries, curses, roar—the plaudits 
for well-aimed shots;The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;Workmen 
searching after damages, making indispen- sable repairs;The fall of grenades 
through the rent roof—the fan- shaped explosion;The whizz of limbs, 
heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.216 Again gurgles 
the mouth of my dying general—he furiously waves with his 
hand;He gasps through the clot, Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments .34217

cold blood of four hun- dred and twelve young men.218 
Retreating, they had form'd in a hollow square, with their 
baggage for breastworks;Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, 
nine times their number, was the price they took in 
advance;Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone;They treated for 
an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave up their 
arms, and march'd back prisoners of war.219 They were the 
glory of the race of rangers;Matchless with horse, rifle, song, 
supper, courtship,Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affec- tionate,Bearded, sunburnt, 
drest in the free costume of hun- ters,Not a single 
one over thirty years of age.220 The second First-day morning
