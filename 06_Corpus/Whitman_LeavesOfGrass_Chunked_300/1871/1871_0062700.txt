earth,I too have felt the resistless call of myself.9 As 
I sail'd down the Mississippi,As I wander'd over the prairies,As 
I have lived—As I have look'd through my windows, my 
eyes,As I went forth in the morning—As I beheld the 
light breaking in the east;As I bathed on the beach 
of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach of 
the Western Sea;As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago—whatever 
streets I have roam'd;Or cities, or silent woods, or peace,

I do not see one imperfection in the universe;And I 
do not see one cause or result lamentable at last 
in the universe.11 O setting sun! though the time has 
come,I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated

lecture-room,How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick;Till rising and 
gliding out, I wander'd off by myself,In the mystical moist 
night-air, and from time to time,Look'd up in perfect silence 
at the stars. TO RICH GIVERS.WHAT you give me, I 
cheerfully accept,A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little 
money— these, as I rendezvous with my poems;A traveler's lodging 
and breakfast as I journey through The States—Why should I 
be ashamed to own such gifts? Why to advertise for 
them?For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon
