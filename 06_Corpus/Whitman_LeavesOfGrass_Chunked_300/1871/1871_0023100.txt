of all, how per- fect!But as for me, for you, 
the irresistible sea is to separate us,As for an hour, 
carrying us diverse—yet cannot carry us diverse for ever;Be not 
impatient—a little space—Know you, I salute the air, the ocean, 
and the land,Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, 
my love.) NATIVE MOMENTS.NATIVE moments! when you come upon me—Ah 
you are here now!Give me now libidinous joys only!Give me 
the drench of my passions! Give me life coarse and 
rank!To-day, I go consort with nature's darlings—to-night too;I am for 
those who believe in loose delights—I share the midnight orgies 
of young men;I dance with the dancers, and drink with 
the drinkers;The echoes ring with our indecent calls;I take for 
my love some prostitute—I pick out some low person for 
my dearest friend,He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate—he shall be 
one condemn'd by others for deeds done;I will play a 
part no longer—Why should I exile myself from my companions?O 
you shunn'd persons! I at least do not shun you,I 
come forthwith in your midst—I will be your poet,I will 
be more to you than to any of the rest. 
ONCE I PASS'D THROUGH A POPULOUS CITY.ONCE I pass'd through 
a populous city, imprinting my brain, for future use, with 
its shows, architec- ture, customs, and traditions;Yet now, of all 
that city, I remember only a woman I casually met 
there, who detained me for love of me;Day by day 
and night by night we were together,—All else has long 
been forgotten by me;I remember, I say, only that woman 
who passionately clung to me;Again we wander—we love—we separate again;Again 
she holds me by the hand—I must not go!I see 
her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremu- 
lous. FACING WEST FROM CALIFORNIA'S SHORES.FACING west, from California's shores,Inquiring,
