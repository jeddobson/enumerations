the past for myself, and for these chants—and now I 
have found it;It is not in those paged fables in 
the libraries, (them I neither accept nor reject;)It is no 
more in the legends than in all else;It is in 
the present—it is this earth to-day;It is in Democracy—(the purport 
and aim of all the past;)It is the life of 
one man or one woman to-day—the av- erage man of 
to-day;It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts;It is in 
the broad show of artificial things, ships, ma- chinery, politics,

faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of 
many children;The face of an amour, the face of veneration;The 
face as of a dream, the face of an immobile 
rock;The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated 
face;A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper;A stallion 
that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of 
the gelder.2 Sauntering the pavement, thus, or crossing the cease- 
less ferry, faces, and faces, and faces:I see them, and 
complain not, and am content with all.23 Do you suppose 
I could be content with all, if I thought them 
their own finale?4 This now is too lamentable a face
