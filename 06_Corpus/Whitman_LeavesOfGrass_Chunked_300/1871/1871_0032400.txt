where the shine is;The athletic American matron speaking in public 
to crowds of listeners;Males, females, immigrants, combinations—the copious- ness—the individuality 
of The States, each for itself—the money-makers;Factories, machinery, the mechanical 
forces—the wind- lass, lever, pulley—All certainties,The certainty of space, increase, 
freedom, futurity,In space, the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars— 
on the firm earth, the lands, my lands;O lands! all 
so dear to me—what you are, (whatever it is,) I 
become a part of that, whatever it is;Southward there, I 
screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the myriads of gulls 
wintering along the coasts of Florida—or in Louisiana, with pelicans 
breeding;Otherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio 
Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombig- bee, the Red 
River, the Saskatchawan, or the Osage, I with the spring 
waters laughing and skipping and running;Northward, on the sands, on 
some shallow bay of Pau- manok, I, with parties of 
snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and 
aquatic plants;Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the crow 
with its bill, for amusement— And I triumphantly twittering; SONG 
OF THE OPEN ROAD.11 AFOOT and light-hearted, I take to 
the open road,Healthy, free, the world before me,The long brown 
path before me, leading wherever I choose.2 Henceforth I ask 
not good-fortune—I myself am good- fortune;Henceforth I whimper no more, 
postpone no more, need nothing,Strong and content, I travel the 
open road.3 The earth—that is sufficient;I do not want the 
constellations any nearer;I know they are very well where they 
are;I know they suffice for those who belong to them.4 
(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens;I carry them, 
men and women—I carry them with me wherever I go;I 
swear it is impossible for me to get rid of 
them;I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them
