the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends 
of the Romans;I hear the tale of the divine life 
and bloody death of the beautiful God—the Christ;I hear the 
Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars, adages, transmitted 
safely to this day, from poets who wrote three thousand

see a great round wonder rolling through the air;I see 
diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails, factories, palaces, hovels, huts 
of barbarians, tents of nomads, upon the surface;I see the

mountain peaks—I see the sierras of Andes and Alleghanies, where

see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, Kazbek, Bazardjusi,I see the 
Rocky Mountains, and the Peak of Winds;I see the Styrian 
Alps, and the Karnac Alps;I see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians—and 
to the north the Dofrafields, and off at sea Mount 
Hecla;I see Vesuvius and Etna—I see the Anahuacs;I see the 
Mountains of the Moon, and the Snow Mountains, and the 
Red Mountains of Mada- gascar;I see the Vermont hills, and 
the long string of Cor- dilleras;I see the vast deserts 
of Western America;I see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic deserts;I 
see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs;I see the superior 
oceans and the inferior ones—the Atlantic and Pacific, the sea 
of Mexico, the Brazilian sea, and the sea of Peru,The 
Japan waters, those of Hindostan, the China Sea, and the
