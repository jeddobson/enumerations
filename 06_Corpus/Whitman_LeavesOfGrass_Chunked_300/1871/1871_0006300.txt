house and stopt out- side;I heard his motions crackling the 
twigs of the wood- pile;Through the swung half-door of the 
kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,And went where he 
sat on a log, and led him in and assured 
him,And brought water, and fill'd a tub for his sweated 
body and bruis'd feet,And gave him a room that enter'd 
from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,And 
remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,And remember 
putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;He

laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;The rest did 
not see her, but she saw them and loved them.60 
The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it 
ran from their long hair:Little streams pass'd all over their 
bodies.61 An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies;It descended 
tremblingly from their temples and ribs.62 The young men float 
on their backs—their white bel- lies bulge to the sun—they 
do not ask who seizes fast to them;They do not 
know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch;They 
do not think whom they souse with spray.1263 The butcher-boy
