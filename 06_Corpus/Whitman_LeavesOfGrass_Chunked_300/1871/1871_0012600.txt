leaves;Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs;Through 
the gymnasium—through the curtain'd saloon —through the office or public 
hall;Pleas'd with the native, and pleas'd with the foreign— pleas'd 
with the new and old;Pleas'd with women, the homely as 
well as the hand- some;Pleas'd with the quakeress as she 
puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously;Pleas'd with the tune

beautiful gentle God by my side;Speeding through space—speeding through heaven 
and the stars;Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad 
ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles;Speeding with tail'd 
meteors—throwing fire balls like the rest;Carrying the crescent child that 
carries its own full mother in its belly;Storming, enjoying, planning, 
loving, cautioning,Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing;I tread day and 
night such roads.197 I visit the orchard of spheres, and
