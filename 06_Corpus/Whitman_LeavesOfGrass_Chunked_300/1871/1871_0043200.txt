The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to ex- 
hibit itself—possesses still underneath;Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus 
of heroes, the wail of slaves,Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps 
of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargain- 
ers,Underneath these, possessing the words that never fail.13 To her 
children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never 
fail;The true words do not fail, for motion does not 
fail, and reflection does not fail;Also the day and night 
do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not 
fail.614 Of the interminable sisters,Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,Of 
the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,The 
beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.15 With 
her ample back towards every beholder,With the fascinations of youth, 
and the equal fascina- tions of age,Sits she whom I 
too love like the rest—sits undis- turb'd,Holding up in her 
hand what has the character of a mirror, while her 
eyes glance back from it, Glance as she sits, inviting 
none, denying none,Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before 
her own face.716 Seen at hand, or seen at a 
distance,Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,Duly approach and 
pass with their companions, or a companion,Looking from no countenances 
of their own, but from the countenances of those who 
are with them,From the countenances of children or women, or 
the manly countenance,From the open countenances of animals, or from 
inani- mate things,From the landscape or waters, or from the 
exquisite apparition of the sky,From our countenances, mine and yours, 
faithfully re- turning them,Every day in public appearing without fail, 
but never twice with the same companions.817 Embracing man, embracing 
all, proceed the three hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the 
sun;Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty-five
