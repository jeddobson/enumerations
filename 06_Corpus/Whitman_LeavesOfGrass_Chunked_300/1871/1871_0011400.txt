for the highest,And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors 
of heaven,And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to 
scorn all machinery,And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses 
any statue,And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions 
of infidels,And I could come every afternoon of my life 
to look at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle 
and baking short-cake.185 I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded 
moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and

placid and self-contain'd;I stand and look at them long and 
long.188 They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They 
do not lie awake in the dark and weep for 
their sins;They do not make me sick discussing their duty 
to God;Not one is dissatisfiedâ€”not one is demented with the 
mania of owning things;Not one kneels to another, nor to 
his kind that lived thousands of years ago;Not one is 
respectable or industrious over the whole earth.189 So they show 
their relations to me, and I accept them;They bring me
