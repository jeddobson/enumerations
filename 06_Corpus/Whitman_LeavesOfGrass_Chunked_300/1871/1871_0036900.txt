tally all antecedents;We are the skald, the oracle, the monk, 
and the knight —we easily include them, and more;We stand 
amid time, beginningless and endless—we stand amid evil and good;All 
swings around us—there is as much darkness as light;The very 
sun swings itself and its system of planets around us;Its 
sun, and its again, all swing around us.3 As for 
me, (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehe- ment 
days,)I have the idea of all, and am all, and 
believe in all;I believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is 
true— I reject no part.4 Have I forgotten any part?Come 
to me, whoever and whatever, till I give you recognition.5 
I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;I adopt each 
theory, myth, god, and demi-god;I see that the old accounts, 
bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception;I assert that all past 
days were what they should have been;And that they could 
no-how have been better than they were,And that to-day is 
what it should be—and that Amer- ica is,And that to-day 
and America could no-how be better than they are.36 In 
the name of These States, and in your and my 
name, the Past,And in the name of These States, and 
in your and my name, the Present time.7 I know 
that the past was great, and the future will be 
great,And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present 
time,(For the sake of him I typify—for the common average 
man's sake—your sake, if you are he;)And that where I 
am, or you are, this present day, there is the 
centre of all days, all races,And there is the meaning, 
to us, of all that has ever come of races 
and days, or ever will come. THE ANSWERER. NOW LIST
