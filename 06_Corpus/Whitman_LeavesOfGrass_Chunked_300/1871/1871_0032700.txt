in return.)25 You road I enter upon and look around! 
I believe you are not all that is here;I believe 
that much unseen is also here.6 Here the profound lesson 
of reception, neither prefer- ence or denial;The black with his 
woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the illiterate person, are 
not denied;The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's 
tramp, the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,The escaped 
youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,The 
early market-man, the hearse, the moving of fur- niture into 
the town, the return back from the town,They pass—I also 
pass—anything passes—none can be interdicted;None but are accepted—none but are 
dear to me:37 You air that serves me with breath 
to speak!You objects that call from diffusion my meanings, and 
give them shape!You light that wraps me and all things 
in delicate equable showers!You paths worn in the irregular hollows 
by the road- sides!I think you are latent with unseen 
existences—you are so dear to me.8 You flagg'd walks of 
the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!You ferries! you 
planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant 
ships!You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd facades! you roofs!You porches 
and entrances! you copings and iron guards!You windows whose transparent 
shells might expose so much!You doors and ascending steps! you 
arches!You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trod- den crossings!From 
all that has been near you, I believe you have 
im- parted to yourselves, and now would impart the same 
secretly to me;From the living and the dead I think 
you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof 
would be evident and amicable with me.49 The earth expanding 
right hand and left hand,The picture alive, every part in 
its best light,The music falling in where it is wanted,
