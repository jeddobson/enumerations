his flabby length on a rock —where the otter is 
feeding on fish;Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps 
by the bayou;Where the black bear is searching for roots 
or honey— where the beaver pats the mud with his 
paddle- shaped tail;Over the growing sugar—over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant—over 
the rice in its low moist field;Over the shar-peak'd farm

on the slip-noose—where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the 
dented sand;Where the she-whale swims with her calf, and never 
forsakes it;Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of 
smoke;Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black 
chip out of the water;Where the half-burn'd brig is riding
