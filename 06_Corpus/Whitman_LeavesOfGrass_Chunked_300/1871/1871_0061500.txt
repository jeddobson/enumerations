horizon rises—I see it parting away for more august dramas;I 
see not America only—I see not only Liberty's nation, but 
other nations preparing;I see tremendous entrances and exits—I see new 
com- binations—I see the solidarity of races;I see that force 
advancing with irresistible power on the world's stage;(Have the old

perhaps a gen- eral divine war;No one knows what will 
happen next—such portents fill the days and nights;Years prophetical! the 
space ahead as I walk, as I vain- ly try 
to pierce it, is full of phantoms;Unborn deeds, things soon 
to be, project their shapes around me;This incredible rush and
