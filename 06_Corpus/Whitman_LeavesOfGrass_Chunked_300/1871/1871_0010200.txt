me with joy.150 O I am wonderful!I cannot tell how 
my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest 
wish;Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the 
cause of the friendship I take again.151 That I walk

O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded?Waiting in 
gloom, protected by frost;The dirt receding before my prophetical screams;I 
underlying causes, to balance them at last;My knowledge my live 
parts—it keeping tally with the meaning of things,HAPPINESS—which, whoever hears
