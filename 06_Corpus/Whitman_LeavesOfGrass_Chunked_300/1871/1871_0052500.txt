Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, ap- pears on the 
streets,People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers;There will 
shortly be no more priests—I say their work is done.Death 
is without emergencies here, but life is perpet- ual emergencies

have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,To life recalling many a prostrate form:)—I 
am willing to wait to be understood by the growth 
of the taste of myself,I reject none, I permit all.46
