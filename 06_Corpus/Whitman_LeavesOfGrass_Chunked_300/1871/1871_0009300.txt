life! sea of unshovell'd yet always- ready graves!Howler and scooper 
of storms! capricious and dainty sea!I am integral with you—I 
too am of one phase, and of all phases.117 Partaker 
of influx and efflux I—extoller of hate and conciliation;Extoller of 
amies, and those that sleep in each others' arms.118 I 
am he attesting sympathy;(Shall I make my list of things 
in the house, and skip the house that supports them?)119 
I am not the poet of goodness only—I do not 
decline to be the poet of wickedness also.120 Washes and 
razors for foofoos—for me freckles and a bristling beard.121 What 
blurt is this about virtue and about vice?Evil propels me, 
and reform of evil propels me—I stand indifferent;My gait is 
no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait;I moisten the roots of all 
that has grown.122 Did you fear some scrofula out of 
the unflagging pregnancy?Did you guess the celestial laws are yet 
to be work'd over and rectified?123 I find one side 
a balance, and the antipodal side a balance;Soft doctrine as 
steady help as stable doctrine;Thoughts and deeds of the present, 
our rouse and early start.124 This minute that comes to 
me over the past decil- lions,There is no better than 
it and now.125 What behaved well in the past, or 
behaves well to- day, is not such a wonder;The wonder 
is, always and always, how there can be a mean 
man or an infidel.23126 Endless unfolding of words of ages!And 
mine a word of the modern—the word En-Masse.127 A word 
of the faith that never balks;Here or henceforward, it is 
all the same to me—I accept Time, absolutely.128 It alone 
is without flaw—it rounds and completes all;That mystic, baffling wonder 
I love, alone completes all.120 I accept reality, and dare 
not question it;Materialism first and last imbuing.130 Hurrah for positive
