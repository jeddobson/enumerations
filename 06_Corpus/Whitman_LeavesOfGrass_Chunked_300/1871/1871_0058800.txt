with them?With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?POET.16 Demons and 
death then I sing;Put in all, aye all, will I—sword-shaped 
pennant for war, and banner so broad and blue,And a 
pleasure new and extatic, and the prattled yearn- ing of 
children,Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the 
liquid wash of the sea;And the black ships, fighting on 
the sea, enveloped in smoke;And the icy cool of the 
far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines;And the whirr 
of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the 
hot sun shining south;And the beach-waves combing over the beach 
on my eastern shore, and my western shore the same;And 
all between those shores, and my ever-running Mississippi, with bends 
and chutes;And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and 
my fields of Missouri;The CONTINENT—devoting the whole identity, without reserving 
an atom,Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with 
all, and the yield of all.BANNER AND PENNANT.17 Aye all! 
for ever, for all!From sea to sea, north and south, 
east and west,(The war is completed, the price is paid, 
the title is settled beyond recall;)Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring 
the whole;No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,But, 
out of the night emerging for good, our voice per- 
suasive no more,Croaking like crows here in the wind.POET.( Finale 
.)18 My limbs, my veins dilate;The blood of the world 
has fill'd me full—my theme is clear at last:—Banner so 
broad, advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty 
and resolute;I burst through where I waited long, too long, 
deafen'd and blinded;My sight, my hearing and tongue, are come 
to me, (a little child taught me;)I hear from above, 
O pennant of war, your ironical call and demand;Insensate! insensate! 
(yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!Not houses
