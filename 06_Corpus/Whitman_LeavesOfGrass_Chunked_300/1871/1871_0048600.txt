The Lord advances, and yet advances;Always the shadow in front—always 
the reach'd hand, bringing up the laggards.17 Out of this 
face emerge banners and horses—O su- perb! I see what 
is coming;I see the high pioneer-caps—I see the staves of 
runners clearing the way,I hear victorious drums.18 This face is 
a life-boat;This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks

is the smoke of the First-day morning,It hangs low over 
the rows of trees by the fences,It hangs thin by 
the sassafras, the wild-cherry, and the cat-brier under them.25 I 
saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,I 
heard what the singers were singing so long.Heard who sprang 
in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue.26 
Behold a woman!She looks out from her quaker cap—her face
