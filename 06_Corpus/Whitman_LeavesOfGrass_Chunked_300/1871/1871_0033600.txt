of the Soul;The efflux of the Soul comes from within, 
through em- bower'd gates, ever provoking questions:These yearnings, why are 
they? These thoughts in the darkness, why are they?Why are 
there men and women that while they are nigh me, 
the sun-light expands my blood!Why, when they leave me, do 
my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?Why are there

love of young and old;From it falls distill'd the charm 
that mocks beauty and attainments;Toward it heaves the shuddering longing 
ache of contact.930 Allons! whoever you are, come travel with

never tires;The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first— Nature 
is rude and incomprehensible at first;Be not discouraged—keep on—there are 
divine things, well envelop'd;I swear to you there are divine
