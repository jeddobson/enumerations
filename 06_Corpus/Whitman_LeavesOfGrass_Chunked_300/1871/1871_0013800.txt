they were brought out in squads, and massacred—it was beautiful 
early summer;The work commenced about five o'clock, and was over 
by eight.221 None obey'd the command to kneel;Some made a 
mad and helpless rush—some stood stark and straight;A few fell

leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported;The 
master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold, to give 
them a chance for them- selves.228 The transit to and
