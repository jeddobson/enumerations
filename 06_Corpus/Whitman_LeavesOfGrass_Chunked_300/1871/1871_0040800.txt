with drooping eyes by the worst- suffering and the most 
restless,I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few 
inches from them,The restless sink in their beds—they fitfully sleep.8 
Now I pierce the darkness—new beings appear,The earth recedes from 
me into the night,I saw that it was beautiful, and 
I see that what is not the earth is beautiful.9 
I go from bedside to bedside—I sleep close with the 
other sleepers, each in turn,I dream in my dream all 
the dreams of the other dream- ers,And I become the 
other dreamers.310 I am a dance—Play up, there! the fit 
is whirling me fast!11 I am the ever-laughing—it is new 
moon and twi- light,I see the hiding of douceurs—I see 
nimble ghosts whichever way I look,Cache, and cache again, deep 
in the ground and sea, and where it is neither 
ground or sea.12 Well do they do their jobs, those 
journeymen divine,Only from me can they hide nothing, and would 
not if they could,I reckon I am their boss, and 
they make me a pet besides,And surround me and lead 
me, and run ahead when I walk,To lift their cunning 
covers, to signify me with stretch'd arms, and resume the 
way;Onward we move! a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting 
music, and wild-flapping pennants of joy!413 I am the actor, 
the actress, the voter, the politician;The emigrant and the exile, 
the criminal that stood in the box,He who has been 
famous, and he who shall be famous after to-day,The stammerer, 
the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person.514 I am 
she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair pectantly,My truant 
lover has come, and it is dark.15 Double yourself and 
receive me, darkness!Receive me and my lover too—he will not 
let me go without him.16 I roll myself upon you,
