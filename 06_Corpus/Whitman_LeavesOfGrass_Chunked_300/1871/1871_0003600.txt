new literatures and religions, new in- ventions and arts.62 These! 
my voice announcing—I will sleep no more, but arise;You oceans 
that have been calm within me! how I feel you, 
fathomless, stirring, preparing unpre- cendented waves and storms.1963 See! steamers 
steaming through my poems!See, in my poems immigrants continually coming 
and landing:See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's 
hut, the flat-boat, the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, 
and the backwoods village;See, on the one side the Western 
Sea, and on the other the Eastern Sea, how they 
advance and retreat upon my poems, as upon their own 
shores.See, pastures and forests in my poems—See, animals, wild and 
tame—See, beyond the Kansas, count- less herds of buffalo, feeding 
on short curly grass;See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, 
inland, with paved streets, with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless 
vehicles, and commerce;See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press—See, the electric telegraph, 
stretching across the Continent, from the Western Sea to Manhat- 
tan;See, through Atlantica's depths, pulses American, Europe reaching—pulses of Europe, 
duly re- turn'd;See, the strong and quick locomotive, as it 
departs, panting, blowing the steam whistle;See, ploughmen, ploughing farms—See, miners, 
dig- ging mines—See, the numberless factories;See, mechanics, busy at their 
benches, with tools— See, from among them, superior judges, philo- 
sophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in working dresses;See, lounging through the 
shops and fields of The States, me, well-belov'd, close-held by 
day and night;Hear the loud echoes of my songs there! 
Read the hints come at last.2064 O Camerado close!O you 
and me at last—and us two only.65 O a word 
to clear one's path ahead endlessly!O something extatic and undemonstrable! 
O music wild!O now I triumph—and you shall also;O hand 
in hand—O wholesome pleasure—O one more desirer and lover!O to 
haste, firm holding—to haste, haste on, with me. 27 THE
