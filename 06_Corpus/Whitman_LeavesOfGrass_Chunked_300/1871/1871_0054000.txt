race are we, from Missouri, with the continental blood intervein'd;All 
the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the 
Northern,Pioneers! O pioneers!10O resistless, restless race!O beloved race in all! 
O my breast aches with tender love for all!O I 
mourn and yet exultâ€”I am rapt with love for all,Pioneers!
