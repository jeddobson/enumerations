stand with my robust Soul.45305 O span of youth! Ever-push'd 
elasticity!O manhood, balanced, florid, and full.306 My lovers suffocate me!Crowding 
my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,Jostling me 
through streets and public halls—coming naked to me at night,Crying 
by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river— swinging 
and chirping over my head,Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, 
tangled under- brush,Lighting on every moment of my life,Bussing my 
body with soft balsamic busses,Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their 
hearts, and giving them to be mine.307 Old age superbly 
rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!308 Every condition 
promulges not only itself—it pro- mulges what grows after and

any.309 I open my scuttle at night and see the 
far-sprinkled systems,And all I see, multiplied as high as I 
can cipher, edge but the rim of the farther systems.310 
Winder and wider they spread, expanding, always ex- panding,Outward and 
outward, and forever outward.311 My sun has his sun, and 
round him obediently wheels,He joins with his partners a group

greatest inside them.312 There is no stoppage, and never can 
be stoppage;If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath 
or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to 
a pallid float, it would not avail in the long 
run;We should surely bring up again where we now stand,And 
as surely go as much farther—and then farther and farther.313 
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic 
leagues, do not hazard the span, or make it im- 
patient;They are but parts—anything is but a part.314 See ever 
so far, there is limitless space outside of that;Count ever 
so much, there is limitless time around that.315 My rendezvous
