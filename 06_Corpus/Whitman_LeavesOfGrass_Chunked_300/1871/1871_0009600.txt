science! long live exact demon- stration!Fetch stonecrop, mixt with cedar 
and branches of lilac;This is the lexicographer—this the chemist—this made 
a grammar of the old cartouches;These mariners put the ship 
through dangerous un- known seas;This is the geologist—this works with 
the scalpel—and this is a mathematician.131 Gentlemen! to you the 
first honors always:Your facts are useful and real—and yet they 
are not my dwelling;(I but enter by them to an 
area of my dwelling.)132 Less the reminders of properties told, 
my words;And more the reminders, they, of life untold, and

nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the 
same terms.138 Through me many long dumb voices;Voices of the 
interminable generations of slaves;Voices of prostitutes, and of deform'd persons;Voices 
of the diseas'd and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs;Voices 
of cycles of preparation and accretion,And of the threads that 
connect the stars—and of wombs and of the father-stuff,And of 
the rights of them the others are down upon;Of the 
trivial, flat, foolish, despised,Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls 
of dung.139 Through me forbidden voices;Voices of sexes and lusts—voices
