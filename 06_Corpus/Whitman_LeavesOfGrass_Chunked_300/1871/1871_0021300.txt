knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg,Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the

or your body, or of any one's body, male or 
female,The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,The brain 
in its folds inside the skull-frame,Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, ma-
