I loafe and invite my Soul;I lean and loafe at 
my ease, observing a spear of sum- mer grass.3 Houses 
and rooms are full of perfumes—the shelves are crowded with 
perfumes;I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like 
it;The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not 
let it.4 The atmosphere is not a perfume—it has no 
taste ofthe distillation—it is odorless;It is for my mouth forever—I 
am in love with it;I will go to the bank 
by the wood, and become undis- guised and naked;I am 
mad for it to be in contact with me.25 The 
smoke of my own breath;Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, 
crotch and vine;My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my 
heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs;The 
sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the 
shore, and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn;The 
sound of the belch'd words of my voice, words loos'd 
to the eddies of the wind;A few light kisses, a 
few embraces, a reaching around of arms;The play of shine 
and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag;The 
delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or 
along the fields and hill-sides;The feeling of health, the full 
noon-trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting 
the sun.6 Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have 
you reckon'd the earth much?Have you practis'd so long to 
learn to read?Have you felt so proud to get at 
the meaning of poems?7 Stop this day and night with 
me, and you shall pos- sess the origin of all 
poems;You shall possess the good of the earth and sun—(there 
are millions of suns left;)You shall no longer take things 
at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes
