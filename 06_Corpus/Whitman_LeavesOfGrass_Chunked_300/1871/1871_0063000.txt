man and woman;For I bestow upon any man or woman 
the entrance to all the gifts of the universe. THOUGHT.OF 
what I write from myself—As if that were not the 
resumé;Of Histories—As if such, however complete, were not less complete 
than the preceding poems;As if those shreds, the records of 
nations, could possibly be as lasting as the preceding poems;As 
if here were not the amount of all nations, and 
of all the lives of heroes. SO LONG!11 To conclude—I 
announce what comes after me;I announce mightier offspring, orators, days, 
and then, for the present, depart.2 I remember I said, 
before my leaves sprang at all,I would raise my voice 
jocund and strong, with reference to consummations.3 When America does 
what was promis'd,When there are plentiful athletic bards, inland and 
seaboard,When through These States walk a hundred millions of superb 
persons,When the rest part away for superb persons, and con- 
tribute to them,When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote 
America,Then to me and mine our due fruition.4 I have 
press'd through in my own right,I have sung the Body 
and the Soul—War and Peace have I sung,And the songs 
of Life and of Birth—and shown that there are many 
births:I have offer'd my style to every one—I have journey'd 
with confident step;While my pleasure is yet at the full, 
I whisper, So long! And take the young woman's hand, 
and the young man's hand, for the last time.25 I 
announce natural persons to arise;I announce justice triumphant;I announce uncompromising 
liberty and equality;I announce the justification of candor, and the 
justifica- tion of pride.6 I announce that the identity of 
These States is a single identity only;I announce the Union 
more and more compact, indis- soluble;I announce splendors and majesties 
to make all the previous politics of the earth insignificant.7
