of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands of cot- 
ton, sugar, rice!Land of wheat, beef, pork! Land of wool 
and hemp! Land of the apple and grape!Land of the 
pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! Land of those 
sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy 
house of adobie!Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where 
the south-west Colorado winds!Land of the eastern Chesapeake! Land of 
the Dela- ware!Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!Land of the 
Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! Land of Vermont and Connecticut!Land of 
the ocean shores! Land of sierras and peaks!Land of boatmen 
and sailors! Fishermen's land!Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passion- 
ate ones!The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! 
the bony-limb'd!The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters 
and the inexperienced sisters!Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! 
the diverse! the compact!The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Caro- 
linian!O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! 
O I at any rate include you all with perfect 
love!I cannot be discharged from you! not from one, any 
sooner than another!O Death! O for all that, I am 
yet of you, unseen, this hour, with irrepressible love,Walking New 
England, a friend, a traveler,Splashing my bare feet in the 
edge of the summer rip- ples, on Paumanok's sands,Crossing the 
praries—dwelling again in Chicago—dwel- ling in every town,Observing shows, births, 
improvements, structures, arts,Listening to the orators and the oratresses in 
public halls,Of and through The States, as during life—each man 
and woman my neighbor,The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to 
me, and I as near to him and her,The Mississippian 
and Arkansian yet with me—and I yet with any of 
them;Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river—yet in 
my house of adobie,Yet returning eastward—yet in the Sea-Side State,
