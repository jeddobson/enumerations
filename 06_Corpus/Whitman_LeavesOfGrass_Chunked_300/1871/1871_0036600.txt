and everywhere, eternal float of solution!Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, 
in the house, or street, or public assembly!Sound out, voices 
of young men! loudly and musically call me by my

years drawing themselves onward, and arrived at these years;You and 
Me arrived—America arrived, and making this year;This year! sending itself 
ahead countless years to come.22 O but it is not 
the years—it is I—it is You;We touch all laws, and
