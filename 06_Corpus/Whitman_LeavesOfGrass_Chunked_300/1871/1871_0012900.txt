look at the product;And look at quintillions ripened, and look 
at quintillions green.198 I fly the flight of the fluid 
and swallowing soul;My course runs below the soundings of plummets.199 
I help myself to material and immaterial;No guard can shut

of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down 
the storm;How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one 
inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,And
