be read,In full rapport at last.2 Here are our thoughts—voyagers' 
thoughts, Here not the land, firm land, alone appears, may 
then by them be said; The sky o'erarches here—we feel 
the undulating deck be- neath our feet, We feel the 
long pulsation—ebb and flow of endless mo- tion; The tones 
of unseen mystery—the vague and vast sugges- tions of the 
briny world—the liquid-flowing sylla- bles, The perfume, the faint creaking 
of the cordage, the melan- choly rhythm, The boundless vista, 
and the horizon far and dim, are all here, And 
this is Ocean's poem .3Then falter not, O book! fulfil 
your destiny!You, not a reminiscence of the land alone,You too, 
as a lone bark, cleaving the ether—purpos'd I know not 
whither—yet ever full of faith,Consort to every ship that sails—sail 
you!Bear forth to them, folded, my love —(Dear mariners! for 
you I fold it here, in every leaf;)Speed on, my 
Book! spread your white sails, my little bark, athwart the 
imperious waves!Chant on—sail on—bear o'er the boundless blue, from me, 
to every shore,This song for mariners and all their ships. 
TO FOREIGN LANDS.I HEARD that you ask'd for something to 
prove this puzzle, the New World,And to define America, her 
athletic Democracy;Therefore I send you my poems, that you behold 
in them what you wanted. TO A HISTORIAN.YOU who celebrate 
bygones!Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races—the 
life that has exhibited itself;Who have treated of man as 
the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers and priests;I, habitan of 
the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself, 
in his own rights,Pressing the pulse of the life that 
has seldom exhibited itself, (the great pride of man in 
himself;)Chanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,I project 
the history of the future. FOR HIM I SING.FOR him
