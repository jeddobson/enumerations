stealthy tread,Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels, swelling the 
house with their plenty,Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, 
and scream at my eyes,That they turn from gazing after 
and down the road,And forthwith cipher and show me a 
cent,Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of 
two, and which is ahead?419 Trippers and askers surround me;People 
I meet—the effect upon me of my early life, or 
the ward and city I live in, or the nation,The

what will come next;Both in and out of the game, 
and watching and won- dering at it.21 Backward I see 
in my own days where I sweated through fog with 
linguists and contenders;I have no mockings or arguments—I witness and 
wait.522 I believe in you, my Soul—the other I am 
must not abase itself to you;And you must not be 
abased to the other.23 Loafe with me on the grass—loose 
the stop from your throat;Not words, not music or rhyme 
I want—not custom or lecture, not even the best;Only the 
lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.24 I 
mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning;How
