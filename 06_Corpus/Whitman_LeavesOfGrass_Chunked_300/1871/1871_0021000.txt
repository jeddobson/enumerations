you ever loved the Body of a man?Your father—where is 
your father?Your mother—is she living? have you been much with 
her? and has she been much with you?—Do you not 
see that these are exactly the same to all, in 
all nations and times, all over the earth?29 If any 
thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,And the glory 
and sweet of a man is the token of man- 
hood untainted;And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred 
body, is beautiful as the most beautiful face.30 Have you 
seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or 
the fool that corrupted her own live body?For they do 
not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.931 O my Body!
