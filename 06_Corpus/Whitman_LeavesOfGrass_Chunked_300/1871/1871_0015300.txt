and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and image;Taking them 
all for what they are worth, and not a cent 
more;Admitting they were alive and did the work of their 
days;(They bore mites, as for unfledg'd birds, who have now 
to rise and fly and sing for themselves;)Accepting the rough 
deific sketches to fill out better in myself—bestowing them freely

waiting my time to be one of the Supremes;The day 
getting ready for me when I shall do as much 
good as the best, and be as prodigious:By my life-lumps! 
becoming already a creator;Putting myself here and now to the
