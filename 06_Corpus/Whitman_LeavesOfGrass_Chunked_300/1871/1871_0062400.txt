perfection,Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;Corroborating forever the triumph 
of things.3 Illustrious every one!Illustrious what we name space—sphere of 
unnum- ber'd spirits;Illustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, 
even the tiniest insect;Illustrious the attribute of speech—the senses—the body;Illustrious 
the passing light! Illustrious the pale reflection on the new

with branches and leaves!(Surely there is something more in each

even the least particle!O spirituality of things!O strain musical, flowing 
through ages and continents —now reaching me and America!I take 
your strong chords—I intersperse them, and cheerfully pass them forward.8 
I too carol the sun, usher'd, or at noon, or, 
as now, setting,I too throb to the brain and beauty 
of the earth, and of all the growths of the
