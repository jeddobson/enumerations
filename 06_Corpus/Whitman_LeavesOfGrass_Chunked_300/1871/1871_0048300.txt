for a man;Some abject louse, asking leave to be—cringing for 
it;Some milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its 
hole.5 This face is a dog's snout, sniffing for garbage;Snakes 
nest in that mouth—I hear the sibilant threat.6 This face 
is a haze more chill than the arctic sea;Its sleepy 
and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.7 This is a 
face of bitter herbs—this an emetic—they need no label;And more 
of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.8 This face is 
an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,Its 
veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they 
show nothing but their whites,Its teeth grit, the palms of 
the hands are cut by the turn'd-in nails,The man falls 
struggling and foaming to the ground while he speculates well.9 
This face is bitten by vermin and worms,And this is 
some murderer's knife, with a half-pull'd scabbard.10 This face owes 
to the sexton his dismalest fee;An unceasing death-bell tolls there.311 
Those then are really men—the bosses and tufts of the 
great round globe!12 Features of my equals, would you trick 
me with your creas'd and cadaverous march?Well, you cannot trick 
me.13 I see your rounded, never-erased flow;I see neath the 
rims of your haggard and mean dis- guises.14 Splay and 
twist as you like—poke with the tangling fores of fishes 
or rats;You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.15 I saw the 
face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had 
at the asylum;And I knew for my consolation what they 
knew not;I knew of the agents that emptied and broke 
my brother,The same wait to clear the rubbish from the 
fallen ten- ement;And I shall look again in a score 
or two of ages,And I shall meet the real landlord, 
perfect and un- harm'd, every inch as good as myself.416
