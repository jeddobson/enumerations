The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital 
as eye- sight;If there be any Soul, there is truth—if 
there be man or woman there is truth—if there be 
physical or moral, there is truth;If there be equilibrium or 
volition, there is truth—if there be things at all upon 
the earth, there is truth.11 O truth of the earth! 
I am determin'd to press my way toward you;Sound your 
voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after 
you.312 Great is Language—it is the mightiest of the sci- 
ences,It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, 
and of men and women, and of all qualities and 
pro- cesses;It is greater than wealth—it is greater than buildings, 
ships, religions, paintings, music.13 Great is the English speech—what speech 
is so great as the English?Great is the English brood—what 
brood has so vast a destiny as the English?It is 
the mother of the brood that must rule the earth 
with the new rule;The new rule shall rule as the 
Soul rules, and as the love, justice, equality in the 
Soul rule.14 Great is Law—great are the few old land-marks 
of the law,They are the same in all times, and 
shall not be dis- turb'd.415 Great is Justice!Justice is not 
settled by legislators and laws—it is in the Soul;It cannot 
be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the 
attraction of gravity, can;It is immutable—it does not depend on 
majorities— majorities or what not, come at last before the 
same passionless and exact tribunal.16 For justice are the grand 
natural lawyers, and per- fect judges—is it in their Souls;It 
is well assorted—they have not studied for nothing —the great 
includes the less;They rule on the highest grounds—they oversee all 
eras, states, administrations. 252 Thought.OF persons arrived at high positions,
