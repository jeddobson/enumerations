and women from the wild woods, and from the pond-side,Breast-sorrel 
and pinks of love—fingers that wind around tighter than vines,Gushes 
from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of 
trees, as the sum is risen;Breezes of land and love—breezes 
set from living shores out to you on the living 
sea—to you, O sailors!Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd fresh

of me! trickle, slow drops,Candid, from me falling—drip, bleeding drops,From 
wounds made to free you whence you were prison'd,From my 
face—from my forehead and lips,From my breast—from within where I 
was conceal'd— press forth, red drops—confession drops;Stain every page—stain every 
song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops;Let them
