abandonment;I will write the evangel-poem of comrades, and of love;(For 
who but I should understand love, with all its sor- 
row and joy?And who but I should be the poet 
of comrades?)823 I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, 
races;I advance from the people in their own spirit;Here is

real and permanent grandeur:(Nor character, nor life worthy the name, 
without Reli- gion;Nor land, nor man or woman, without Religion.)929 
What are you doing, young man?Are you so earnest—so given 
up to literature, science, art, amours?These ostensible realities, politics, points?Your 
ambition or business, whatever it may be?30 It is well—Against 
such I say not a word—I am their poet also;But 
behold! such swiftly subside— burnt up for Reli- gion's sake;For
