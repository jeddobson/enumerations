out of your friends' mouths?No, the real words are more 
delicious than they.4 Human bodies are words, myriads of words;In 
the best poems re-appears the body, man's or wo- man's, 
well-shaped, natural, gay,Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or 
the need of shame.25 Air, soil, water, fire—these are words;I 
myself am a word with them—my qualities interpene- trate with 
theirs—my name is nothing to them;Though it were told in 
the three thousand languages, what would air, soil, water, fire, 
know of my name?6 A healthy presence, a friendly or 
commanding ges- ture, are words, sayings, meanings;The charms that go 
with the mere looks of some men and women, are 
sayings and meanings also.37 The workmanship of souls is by 
the inaudible words of the earth;The great masters know the 
earth's words, and use them more than the audible words.8 
Amelioration is one of the earth's words;The earth neither lags 
nor hastens;It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself 
from the jump;It is not half beautiful only—defects and excrescences 
show just as much as perfections show.9 The earth does 
not withhold, it is generous enough;The truths of the earth 
continually wait, they are not so conceal'd either;They are calm, 
subtle, untransmissible by print;They are imbued through all things, conveying 
them- selves willingly,Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth—I 
utter and utter,I speak not, yet if you hear me 
not, of what avail am I to you?To bear—to better—lacking 
these, of what avail am I?410 Accouche! Accouchez!Will you rot 
your own fruit in yourself there?Will you squat and stifle 
there?11 The earth does not argue, Is not pathetic, has 
no arrangements,Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,Makes no discriminations, 
has no conceivable failures,Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,Of 
all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.512
