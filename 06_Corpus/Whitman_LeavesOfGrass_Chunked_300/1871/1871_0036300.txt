should come home to me?Who knows but I am enjoying 
this?Who knows but I am as good as looking at 
you now, for all you cannot see me?20 It is 
not you alone, nor I alone;Not a few races, nor 
a few generations, nor a few cen- turies;It is that 
each came, or comes, or shall come, from its due 
emission,From the general centre of all, and forming a part 
of all:Everything indicates—the smallest does, and the largest does;A necessary 
film envelopes all, and envelops the Soul for a proper 
time.1021 Now I am curious what sight can ever be 
more stately and admirable to me than my mast- hemm'd 
Manhattan,My river and sun-set, and my scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide,The 
sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and 
the belated lighter;Curious what Gods can exceed these that clasp 
me by the hand, and with voices I love call 
me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I 
approach;Curious what is more subtle than this which ties me 
to the woman or man that looks in my face,Which 
fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into 
you.22 We understand, then, do we not?What I promis'd without 
mentioning it, have you not accepted?What the study could not 
teach—what the preaching could not accomplish, is accomplish'd, is it 
not?What the push of reading could not start, is started 
by me personally, is it not?1123 Flow on, river! flow 
with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!Frolic on, crested 
and scallop-edg'd waves!Gorgeous clouds of the sun-set! drench with your 
splendor me, or the men and women generations after me;Cross 
from shore to shore, countless crowds of passen- gers!Stand up, 
tall masts of Mannahatta!—stand up, beau- tiful hills of Brooklyn!Throb, 
baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!Suspend here
