tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,I, a child, very old, 
over waves, towards the house of maternity, the land of 
migrations, look afar,Look off the shores of my Western Sea—the 
circle almost circled;For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales 
of Kashmere,From. Asia—from the north—from the God, the sage, and

HIM THAT WAS CRUCIFIED.My spirit to yours, dear brother;Do not 
mind because many, sounding your name, do not understand you;I 
do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there 
are others also;)I specify you with joy, O my comrade, 
to salute you, and to salute those who are with 
you, before and since—and those to come also,That we all 
labor together, transmitting the same charge and succession;We few, equals,
