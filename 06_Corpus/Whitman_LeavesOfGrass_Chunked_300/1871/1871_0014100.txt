so many strange faces, they do not know whom to 
trust.229 Our frigate takes fire;The other asks if we demand 
quarter?If our colors are struck, and the fighting is done?230 
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of 
my little captain, We have not struck, he composedly cries, 
we have just begun our part of the fighting .231 
Only three guns are in use;One is directed by the 
captain himself against the ene- my's main-mast;Two, well served with 
grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his decks.232 
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, 
especially the main-top;They hold out bravely during the whole of 
the action.233 Not a moment's cease;The leaks again fast on 
the pumps—the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.234 One of the 
pumps has been shot away—it is gene- rally thought we 
are sinking.235 Serene stands the little captain;He is not hurried—his 
voice is neither high nor low;His eyes give more light 
to us than our battle-lan- terns.236 Toward twelve at night, 
there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to 
us.36237 Stretch'd and still lies the midnight;Two great hulls motionless 
on the breast of the dark- ness;Our vessel riddled and 
slowly sinking—preparations to pass to the one we have conquer'd;The 
captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a 
countenance white as a sheet;Near by, the corpse of the 
child that serv'd in the cabin;The dead face of an 
old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers;The 
flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft 
and below;The husky voices of the two or three officers 
yet fit for duty;Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by 
themselves— dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,Cut of 
cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of
