coming a bit nearer the beginning than any.711 Whatever satisfies 
Souls is true;Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of 
Souls;Itself only finally satisfies the Soul;The Soul has that measureless 
pride which revolts from every lesson but its own.812 Now 
I give you an inkling;Now I breathe the word of 
the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,That answers 
the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.13 What 
is prudence, is indivisible,Declines to separate one part of life 
from every part,Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous, or 
the living from the dead,Matches every thought or act by 
its correlative,Knows no possible forgiveness, or deputed atonement,Knows that the 
young man who composedly peril'd his life and lost it, 
has done exceedingly well for himself, without doubt,That he who 
never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age 
in riches and ease, has probably achiev'd nothing for himself 
worth mentioning;Knows that only that person has really learn'd, who 
has learn'd to prefer results,Who favors Body and Soul the 
same,Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,Who in his 
spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries or avoids death. 
All is Truth.1 O ME, man of slack faith so 
long!Standing aloof—denying portions so long;Only aware to-day of compact, all-diffused 
truth;Discovering to-day there is no lie, or form of lie, 
and can be none, but grows as inevitably upon itself 
as the truth does upon itself,Or as any law of 
the earth, or any natural production of the earth does.2 
(This is curious, and may not be realized immediately —But 
it must be realized;I feel in myself that I represent 
falsehoods equally with the rest,And that the universe does.)3 Where 
has fail'd a perfect return, indifferent of lies or the 
truth?Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire?
