I announce adhesiveness—I say it shall be limitless, unloosen'd;I say 
you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.8 
I announce a man or woman coming—perhaps you are the 
one, ( So long! )I announce the great individual, fluid 
as Nature, chaste, affectionate, compassionate, fully armed.9 I announce a 
life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold;I announce an 
end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation;I announce 
myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet- blooded;I announce a race 
of splendid and savage old men.310 O thicker and faster! 
( So long! )O crowding too close upon me;I foresee 
too much—it means more than I thought;It appears to me 
I am dying.11 Hasten throat, and sound your last!Salute me—salute 
the days once more. Peal the old cry once more.12 
Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,At random glancing, each as I 
notice absorbing,Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,Curious envelop'd messages 
delivering,Sparkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,Myself unknowing, 
my commission obeying, to question it never daring,To ages, and 
ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,To troops out 
of me, out of the army, the war arising— they 
the tasks I have set promulging,To women certain whispers of 
myself bequeathing— their affection me more clearly explaining,To young men 
my problems offering—no dallier I—I the muscle of their brains 
trying,So I pass—a little time vocal, visible, contrary;Afterward, a melodious 
echo, passionately bent for— (death making me really undying;)The best 
of me then when no longer visible—for toward that I 
have been incessantly preparing.13 What is there more, that I 
lag and pause, and crouch extended with unshut mouth?Is there 
a single final farewell?414 My songs cease—I abandon them;From behind 
the screen where I hid, I advance person- ally, solely 
to you.15 Camerado! This is no book;Who touches this, touches 
a man;(Is it night? Are we here alone?)It is I 
you hold, and who holds you;I spring from the pages 
into your arms—decease calls me forth.16 O how your fingers 
drowse me!Your breath falls around me like dew—your pulse lulls 
the tympans of my ears;I feel immerged from head to 
foot;Delicious—enough.
