mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;Off on the 
lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in 
the frozen surface;The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the

lakes or bays, or along coasts—a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;At home 
on Kanadian snow-shoes, or up in the bush, or with
