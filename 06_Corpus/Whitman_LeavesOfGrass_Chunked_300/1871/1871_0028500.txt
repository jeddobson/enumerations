West!To you many things to absorb, I teach, to help 
you become eleve of mine:Yet if blood like mine circle 
not in your veins;If you be not silently selected by 
lovers, and do not silently select lovers,Of what use is 
it that you seek to become eleve of mine? O

time within me the midnight sun just rises above the 
horizon, and sinks again;Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, 
groups,Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.34 What do 
you hear, Walt Whitman?5 I hear the workman singing, and
