in the factory or mill;The nine months' gone is in 
the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing;The paving-man 
leans on his two-handed rammer—the reporter's lead flies swiftly over 
the note-book— the sign-painter is lettering with red and gold;The 
canal-boy trots on the tow-path—the book-keeper counts at his desk—the
