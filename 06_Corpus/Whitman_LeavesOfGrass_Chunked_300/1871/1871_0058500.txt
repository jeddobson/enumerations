ships sailing in and out;Then over all, (aye! aye!) my 
little and lengthen'd pennant shaped like a sword,Runs swiftly up, 
indicating war and defiance—And now the halyards have rais'd it,Side 
of my banner broad and blue—side of my starry banner,Discarding 
peace over all the sea and land.BANNER AND PENNANT.13 Yet 
louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!No longer let 
our children deem us riches and peace alone;We may be 
terror and carnage, and are so now;Not now are we 
any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor any 
five, nor ten;)Nor market nor depot are we, nor money-bank 
in the city;But these, and all, and the brown and 
spreading land, and the mines below, are ours;And the shores 
of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and 
small;And the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops 
and the fruits are ours;Bays and channels, and ships sailing 
in and out, are ours—and we over all,Over the area 
spread below, the three or four millions of square miles—the 
capitals,The forty millions of people—O bard! in life and death 
supreme,We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,Not 
for the present alone, for a thousand years, chant- ing 
through you,This song to the soul of one poor little 
child.CHILD.14 O my father, I like not the houses;They will 
never to me be anything—nor do I like money;But to 
mount up there I would like, O father dear— that 
banner I like;That pennant I would be, and must be.FATHER.15 
Child of mine, you fill me with anguish;To be that 
pennant would be too fearful;Little you know what it is 
this day, and after this day, forever;It is to gain 
nothing, but risk and defy everything;Forward to stand in front 
of wars—and O, such wars; —what have you to do
