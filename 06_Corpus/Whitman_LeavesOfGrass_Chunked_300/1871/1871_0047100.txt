and shore mud;These became part of that child who went 
forth every day, and who now goes, and will always 
go forth every day. LONGINGS FOR HOME.O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, 
perfumed South! My South!O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and 
love! Good and evil! O all dear to me!O dear 
to me my birth-things—All moving things, and the trees where

swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave 
has his conceal'd hut;)O the strange fascination of these half-known, 
half- impassable swamps, infested by reptiles, resound- ing with the 
bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl 
and the wild cat, and the whirr of the rattlesnake;The
