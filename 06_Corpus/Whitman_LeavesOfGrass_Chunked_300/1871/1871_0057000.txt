liquid, sane, unruly, musical, self-sufficient;I see that the word of 
my city is that word up there,Because I see that 
word nested in nests of water-bays, superb, with tall and 
wonderful spires,Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and steamships—an 
island sixteen miles long, solid- founded,Numberless crowded streets—high growths of 
iron, slender, strong, light, splendidly uprising to- ward clear skies,Tides 
swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sun- down,The flowing 
sea-currents, the little islands, larger ad- joining islands, the heights,

waters! the city of spires and masts!The city nested in 
bays! my city!The city of such women, I am mad 
to be with them! I will return after death to 
be with them!The city of such young men, I swear 
I cannot live happy, without I often go talk, walk, 
eat, drink, sleep, with them! OLD IRELAND.1 FAR hence, amid 
an isle of wondrous beauty,Crouching over a grave, an ancient 
sorrowful mother,Once a queen—now lean and tatter'd, seated on the
