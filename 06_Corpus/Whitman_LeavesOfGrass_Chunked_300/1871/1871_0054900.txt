infidels be countenanced!Let the eminence of meanness, treachery, sarcasm, hate, 
greed, indecency, impotence, lust, be taken for granted above all! 
let writers, judges, govern- ments, households, religions, philosophies, take such 
for granted above all!Let the worst men beget children out 
of the worst women!Let the priest still play at immortality!Let 
death be inaugurated!Let nothing remain but the ashes of teachers, 
artists; moralists, lawyers, and learn'd and polite per- sons!Let him 
who is without my poems be assassinated!Let the cow, the 
horse, the camel, the garden-bee—let the mud-fish, the lobster, the 
mussel, eel, the sting-ray, and the grunting pig-fish—let these, and 
the like of these, be put on a perfect equality 
with man and woman!Let churches accommodate serpents, vermin, and the 
corpses of those who have died of the most filty 
of diseases!Let marriage slip down among fools, and be for 
none but fools!Let men among themselves talk and think forever 
ob- scencly of women! and let women among them- selves 
talk and think obscenely of men!Let us all, without missing 
one, be exposed in public, naked, monthly, at the peril 
of our lives! let our bodies be freely handled and 
examined by whoever chooses!Let nothing but copies at second hand 
be permitted to exist upon the earth!Let the earth desert 
God, nor let there ever henceforth be mention'd the name 
of God!Let there be no God!Let there be money, business, 
imports, exports, custom, authority, precedents, pallor, dyspepsia, smut, ignorance, unbelief!Let 
judges and criminals be transposed! let the prison- keepers be 
put in prison! let those that were prisoners take the 
keys! (Say! why might they not just as well be 
transposed?)Let the slaves be masters! let the masters become slaves!Let 
the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever 
bawling! let an idiot or insane person appear on each
