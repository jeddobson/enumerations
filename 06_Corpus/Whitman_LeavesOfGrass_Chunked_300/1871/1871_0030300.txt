school of moss-bonkers—they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,The 
boats separate—they diverge and row off, each on its rounding 
course to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;The net is drawn 
in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,Some of 
the fishermen lounge in their boats—others stand negligently ankle-deep in 
the water, pois'd on strong legs;The boats are partly drawn 
up—the water slaps against them;On the sand, in heaps and

northward in Christiania or Stockholm—or in Siberian Irkutsk—or in some 
street in Iceland;I descend upon all those cities, and rise 
from them again.1027 I see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries;I 
see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd 
splint, the fetish, and the obi.28 I see African and
