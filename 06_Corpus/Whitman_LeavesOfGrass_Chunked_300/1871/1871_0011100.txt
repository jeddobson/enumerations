and worry me.174 The sentries desert every other part of 
me;They have left me helpless to a red marauder;They all 
come to the headland, to witness and assist against me.175 
I am given up by traitors;I talk wildly—I have lost 
my wits—I and nobody else am the greatest traitor;I went 
myself first to the headland—my own hands car- ried me 
there.176 You villain touch! what are you doing? My breath 
is tight in its throat;Unclench your floodgates! you are too 
much for me.29177 Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath'd, hooded, sharp 
tooth'd touch!Did it make you ache so, leaving me?178 Parting, 
track'd by arriving—perpetual payment of perpetual loan;Rich, showering rain, and 
recompense richer after- ward.179 Sprouts take and accumulate—stand by the 
curb prolific and vital:Landscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden.30180 All 
truths wait in all things;They neither hasten their own delivery, 
nor resist it;They do not need the obstetric forceps of 
the surgeon;The insignificant is as big to me as any;(What 
is less or more than a touch?)181 Logic and sermons 
never convince;The damp of the night drives deeper into my 
soul.182 Only what proves itself to every man and woman 
is so;Only what nobody denies is so.183 A minute and 
a drop of me settle my brain;I believe the soggy 
clods shall become lovers and lamps,And a compend of compends 
is the meat of a man or woman,And a summit 
and flower there is the feeling they have for each 
other,And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson 
until it becomes omnific,And until every one shall delight us, 
and we them.31184 I believe a leaf of grass is 
no less than the journey- work of the stars,And the 
pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and 
the egg of the wren,And the tree-toad is a chef-d'uvre
