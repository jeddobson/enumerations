itself,Around the Idea of thee. STARTING FROM PAUMANOK.11 STARTING from 
fish-shape Paumanok, where I was born,Well-begotten, and rais'd by a 
perfect mother;After roaming many lands—lover of populous pave- ments;Dweller in 
Mannahatta, my city—or on southern sa- vannas;Or a soldier camp'd, 
or carrying my knapsack and gun— or a miner in 
California;Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet 
meat, my drink from the spring;Or withdrawn to muse and 
meditate in some deep re- cess,Far from the clank of 
crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy;Aware of the fresh free 
giver, the flowing Missouri— aware of mighty Niagara;Aware of the 
buffalo herds, grazing the plains—the hirsute and strong-breasted bull;Of earth, 
rocks, Fifth-month flowers, experienced— stars, rain, snow, my amaze;Having studied 
the mocking-bird's tones, and the mountain-hawk's,And heard at dusk the 
unrival'd one, the hermit thrush from the swamp-cedars,Solitary, singing in 
the West, I strike up for a New World.22 Victory, 
union, faith, identity, time,The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,Eternal progress, the 
kosmos, and the modern reports.3 This, then, is life;Here is 
what has come to the surface after so many throes 
and convulsions.4 How curious! how real!Underfoot the divine soil—overhead the 
sun.5 See, revolving, the globe;The ancestor-continents, away, group'd together;The present 
and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus between.6 
See, vast, trackless spaces;As in a dream, they change, they 
swiftly fill;Countless masses debouch upon them;They are now cover'd with 
the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.7 See, projected, through time,For 
me, an audience interminable.8 With firm and regular step they 
wend—they never stop,Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;One generation 
playing its part, and passing on;Another generation playing its part, 
and passing on in its turn,With faces turn'd sideways or 
backward towards me, to listen,With eyes retrospective towards me.39 Americanos! 
conquerors! marches humanitarian;Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!For you a programme
