indifferent of lands, indifferent of times;We, enclosers of all continents, 
all castes—allowers of all theologies,Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,We walk 
silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the disputers, 
nor any thing that is asserted;We hear the bawling and 
din—we are reached at by divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every 
side,They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my comrade,Yet 
we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, jour- neying 
up and down, till we make our inefface- able mark 
upon time and the diverse eras,Till we saturate time and 
eras, that the men and wo- men of races, ages 
to come, may prove brethren and lovers, as we are. 
120 PERFECTIONS.ONLY themselves understand themselves, and the like of themselves,As 
Souls only understand Souls, CALAMUS. IN PATHS UNTRODDEN.IN paths untrodden,In 
the growth by margins of pond-waters,Escaped from the life that 
exhibits itself,From all the standards hitherto publish'd—from the pleasures, profits, 
eruditions, conformities,Which too long I was offering to feed my 
soul;Clear to me, now, standards not yet publish'd—clear to me 
that my Soul,That the Soul of the man I speak 
for, feeds, rejoices most in comrades;Here, by myself, away from 
the clank of the world,Tallying and talk'd to here by 
tongues aromatic,No longer abash'd—for in this secluded spot I can 
re- spond as I would not dare elsewhere,Strong upon me 
the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains all 
the rest,Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of 
manly attachment,Projecting them along that substantial life,Bequeathing, hence, types of 
athletic love,Afternoon, this delicious Ninth-month, in my forty-first year,I proceed, 
for all who are, or have been, young men,To tell 
the secret of my nights and days,To celebrate the need 
of comrades. SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST.SCENTED herbage of my 
breast,Leaves from you I yield, I write, to be perused
