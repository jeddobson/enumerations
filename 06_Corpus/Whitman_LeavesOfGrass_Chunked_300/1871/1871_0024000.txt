best afterwards,Tomb-leaves, body-leaves, growing up above me, above death,Perennial roots, 
tall leaves—O the winter shall not freeze you, delicate leaves,Every 
year shall you bloom again—Out from where you retired, you 
shall emerge again;O I do not know whether many, passing

have long enough stifled and choked:—Emblematic and capricious blades, I 
leave you—now you serve me not;Away! I will say what 
I have to say, by itself,I will escape from the 
sham that was proposed to me,I will sound myself and
