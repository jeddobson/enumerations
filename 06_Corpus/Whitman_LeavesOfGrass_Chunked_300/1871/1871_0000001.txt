INSCRIPTIONS. ONE'S-SELF I SING.1 ONE'S-SELF I sing—a simple, separate Person;Yet 
utter the word Democratic, the word En-masse .2 Of Physiology 
from top to toe I sing;Not physiognomy alone, nor brain 
alone, is worthy for the muse—I say the Form complete 
is worthier far;The Female equally with the male I sing.3 
Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,Cheerful—for freest action

on every side expanding,With whistling winds and music of the 
waves—the large imperious waves—In such,Or some lone bark, buoy'd on 
the dense marine,Where, joyous, full of faith, spreading white sails,She 
cleaves the ether, mid the sparkle and the foam of 
day, or under many a star at night,By sailors young 
and old, haply will I, a reminiscence of the land,
