Western golden shoresThe countries there, with their populations—the mil- lions 
en-masse, are curiously here;The swarming market places—the temples, with idols 
ranged along the sides, or at the end—bonze, brahmin, and 
lama;The mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisher- man;The singing-girl and 
the dancing-girl—the ecstatic person—the secluded Emperors,Confucius himself—the great poets and 
heroes—the warriors, the castes, all,Trooping up, crowding from all directions—from

the old, the Asiatic, renew'd, as it must be,Commencing from 
this day, surrounded by the world.611 And you, Libertad of 
the world!You shall sit in the middle, well-pois'd, thousands of 
years;As to-day, from one side, the nobles of Asia come 
to you;As to-morrow, from the other side, the Queen of 
Eng- land sends her eldest son to you.712 The sign 
is reversing, the orb is enclosed,The ring is circled, the
