Be not ashamed, women—your privilege encloses the rest, and is 
the exit of the rest;You are the gates of the 
body, and you are the gates of the soul.13 The 
female contains all qualities, and tempers them —she is in 
her place, and moves with perfect balance;She is all things 
duly veil'd—she is both passive and active;She is to conceive 
daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as

place in the procession.17 (All is a procession;The universe is 
a procession, with measured and beau- tiful motion.)18 Do you 
know so much yourself, that you call the slave or 
the dull-face ignorant?Do you suppose you have a right to
