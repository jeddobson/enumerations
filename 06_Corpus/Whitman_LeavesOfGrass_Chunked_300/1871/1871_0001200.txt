of chants.10 Chants of the prairies;Chants of the long-running Mississippi, 
and down to the Mexican sea;Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, 
Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota;Chants going forth from the centre, from 
Kansas, and thence, equi-distant,Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to 
vivify all.411 In the Year 80 of The States,My tongue, 
every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this 
air,Born here of parents born here, from parents the same,

(moving awhile among it;)Think nothing can ever be greater—nothing can 
ever deserve more than it deserves;Regarding it all intently a 
long while—then dismiss- ing it,I stand in my place, with 
my own day, here.17 Here lands female and male;Here the 
heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world—here the flame of materials;Here
