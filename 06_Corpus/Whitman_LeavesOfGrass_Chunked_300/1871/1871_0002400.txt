in the briers, hatching her brood.39 I have seen the 
he-bird also;I have paused to hear him, near at hand, 
inflating his throat, and joyfully singing.40 And while I paused, 
it came to me that what he really sang for 
was not there only,Nor for his mate, nor himself only, 
nor all sent back by the echoes;But subtle, clandestine, away

in the future;And I will show that whatever happens to 
anybody, it may be turn'd to beautiful results—and I will 
show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death;And I 
will thread a thread through my poems that time and 
events are compact,And that all the things of the universe
