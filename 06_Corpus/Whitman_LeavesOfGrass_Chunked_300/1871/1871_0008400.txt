blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.86 
Vivas to those who have fail'd!And to those whose war-vessels 
sank in the sea!And to those themselves who sank in 
the sea!And to all generals that lost engagements! and all

to me.95 I do not snivel that snivel the world

filth;That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing
