whispering through medium of me;Of vista—Suppose some sight in arriere, 
through the formative chaos, presuming the growth, fulness, life, now 
attain'd on the journey;(But I see the road continued, and 
the journey ever continued;)—Of what was once lacking on earth, 
and in due time has become supplied—And of what will 
yet be supplied,Because all I see and know, I believe 
to have purport in what will yet be supplied. THE 
SLEEPERS.11 I WANDER all night in my vision,Stepping with light 
feet, swiftly and noiselessly step- ping and stopping,Bending with open 
eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,Wandering and confused, lost 
to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.2 How solemn 
they look there, stretch'd and still!How quiet they breathe, the 
little children in their cradles!3 The wretched features of ennuyés, 
the white features of corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, 
the sick- gray faces of onanists,The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, 
the insane in their strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the 
new- born emerging from gates, and the dying emerg- ing 
from gates,The night pervades them and infolds them.4 The married 
couple sleep calmly in their bed—he with his palm on 
the hip of the wife, and she with her palm 
on the hip of the husband,The sisters sleep lovingly side 
by side in their bed,The men sleep lovingly side by 
side in theirs,And the mother sleeps, with her little child 
carefully wrapt.5 The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb 
sleep,The prisoner sleeps well in the prison—the run-away son sleeps;The 
murderer that is to be hung next day—how does he 
sleep?And the murder'd person—how does he sleep?6 The female that 
loves unrequited sleeps,And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,The head 
of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,And the enraged 
and treacherous dispositions—all, all sleep.27 I stand in the dark
