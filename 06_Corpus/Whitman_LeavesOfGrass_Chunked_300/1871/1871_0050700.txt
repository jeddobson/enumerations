with yearly freshets and changing chutes— Columbia, Niagara, Hudson, spending 
them- selves lovingly in him,If the Atlantic coast stretch, or 
the Pacific coast stretch, he stretching with them north or 
south,Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is 
between them,Growths growing from him to offset the growth of 
pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cotton-wood, orange, magnolia,Tangles 
as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,He likening 
sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent 
ice,Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, up- land,

to stand in the presence of superiors,The freshness and candor 
of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their phrenology,The 
picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierce- ness when wrong'd,The 
fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, 
good temper, and open-handedness— the whole composite make,The prevailing ardor 
and enterprise, the large amative- ness,The perfect equality of the 
female with the male, the fluid movement of the population,The
