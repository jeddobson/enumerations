from me.248 I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one 
of an average unending procession;Inland and sea-coast we go, and 
we pass all boundary lines;Our swift ordinances on their way 
over the whole earth;The blossoms we wear in our hats 
the growth of thou- sands of years.249 Eleves, I salute

I give myself.258 You there, impotent, loose in the knees!Open 
your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you;Spread your 
palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets;I am not 
to be denied—I compel—I have stores? plenty and to spare;And
