instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk;When I 
can touch the body of books, by night or by 
day, and when they touch my body back again;When a 
university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child convince;When 
the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night 
watchman's daughter;When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are 
my friendly companions;I intend to reach them my hand, and 
make as much of them as I do of men 
and women like you.26 The sum of all known reverence 
I add up in you, whoever you are;The President is 
there in the White House for you—it is not you 
who are here for him;The Secretaries act in their bureaus 
for you—not you here for them;The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month 
for you;Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of 
cities, the going and coming of commerce and mails, are 
all for you.27 List close, my scholars dear!All doctrines, all 
politics and civilization, exurge from you;All sculpture and monuments, and 
anything inscribed anywhere, are tallied in you;The gist of histories 
and statistics as far back as the records reach, is 
in you this hour, and myths and tales the same;If 
you were not breathing and walking here, where would they 
all be?The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and 
plays would be vacuums.28 All architecture is what you do 
to it when you look upon it;(Did you think it 
was in the white or gray stone? or the lines 
of the arches and cornices?)29 All music is what awakes 
from you, when you are reminded by the instruments;It is 
not the violins and the cornets—it is not the oboe 
nor the beating drums, nor the score of the baritone 
singer singing his sweet romanza—nor that of the men's chorus,
