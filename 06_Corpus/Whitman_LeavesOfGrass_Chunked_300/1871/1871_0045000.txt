have fully alerted me— when heaven-clouds canopy my city with 
a delicate thin haze;When, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the 
for- ests at the wharves, thicken with colors;When every ship, 
richly drest, carries her flag at the peak;When pennants trail, 
and street-festoons hang from the windows;When Broadway is entirely given 
up to foot-passengers and foot-standers—when the mass is densest;When the

appears—the Asiatic con- tinent itself appears—the Past, the dead,The murky 
night-morning of wonder and fable, inscru- table,The enveloped mysteries, the 
old and unknown hive- bees,The North—the sweltering South—eastern Assyria— the 
Hebrews—the Ancient of Ancients,Vast desolated cities—the gliding Present—all of these, 
and more, are in the pageant-procession.9 Geography, the world, is 
in it;The great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the 
coast beyond;The coast you, henceforth, are facing—you Libertad! from your
