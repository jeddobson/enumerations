he smiles in his sleep!)The scout riding on horseback over 
the plains west of the Mississippi—he ascends a knoll and 
sweeps his eye around;California life—the miner, bearded, dress'd in his 
rude costume—the stanch California friendship—the sweet air—the graves one, in 
passing, meets, solitary, just aside the horse-path;Down in Texas, the 
cotton-field, the negro-cabins— drivers driving mules or oxen before rude 
carts— cotton bales piled on banks and wharves;Encircling all, vast-darting, 
up and wide, the American Soul, with equal hemispheres—one Love, 
one Dilation or Pride;—In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, 
the abo- rigines—the calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbi- tration, 
and indorsement,The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun 
and then toward the earth,The drama of the scalp-dance enacted 
with painted faces and guttural exclamations,The setting out of the 
war-party—the long and stealthy march,The single-file—the swinging hatchets—the surprise and 
slaughter of enemies;—All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of 
These States—reminiscences, all institutions,All These States, compact—Every square mile of 
These States, without excepting a particle—you also— me also,Me pleas'd, 
rambling in lanes and country fields, Pau- manok's fields,Me, observing 
the spiral flight of two little yellow but- terflies, shuffling 
between each other, ascending high in the air;The darting swallow, 
the destroyer of insects—the fall traveler southward, but returning northward 
early in the spring;The country boy at the close of 
the day, driving the herd of cows, and shouting to 
them as they loiter to browse by the road-side;The city 
wharf—Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans, San Francisco,The departing ships, 
when the sailors heave at the capstan;—Evening—me in my room—the 
setting sun,The setting summer sun shining in my open window, 
showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air 
in the centre of the room, darting athwart, up and 
down, casting swift shadows in specks on the opposite wall,
