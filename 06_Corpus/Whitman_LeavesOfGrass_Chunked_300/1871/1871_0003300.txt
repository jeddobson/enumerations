or in Maryland,Yet Kanadian, cheerily braving the winter—the snow and 
ice welcome to me,Yet a true son either of Maine, 
or of the Granite State, or of the Narragansett Bay 
State, or of the Empire State;Yet sailing to other shores 
to annex the same—yet welcoming every new brother;Hereby applying these 
leaves to the new ones, from the hour they unite 
with the old ones;Coming among the new ones myself, to

Oshkosh, Walla- Walla;Leaving such to The States, they melt, they 
depart, charging the water and the land with names.1861 O 
expanding and swift! O henceforth,Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and 
audacious;A world primal again—Vistas of glory, incessant and branching;A new 
race, dominating previous ones, and grander far—with new contests,New politics,
