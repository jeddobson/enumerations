man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.5 A 
fog follows—antiques of the same come limping,Some appear wooden-legged, and 
some appear ban- daged and bloodless.6 Why this is indeed 
a show! It has called the dead out of the 
earth!The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!Phantoms! 
phantoms countless by flank and rear!Cock'd hats of mothy mould! 
crutches made of mist!Arms in slings! old men leaning on 
young men's shoul- ders!7 What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What 
is all this clattering of bare gums?Does the ague convulse

to the Mayor—he shall send a com- mittee to England;They 
shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a 
cart to the royal vault—haste!Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap 
him quick from the grave-clothes, box up his bones for 
a journey;Find a swift Yankee clipper—here is freight for you, 
black-bellied clipper,Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer 
straight toward Boston bay.14 Now call for the President's marshal 
again, bring out the government cannon,Fetch home the roarers from
