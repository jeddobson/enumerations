comrades only—I will never again utter a call, only their 
call,I will raise, with it, immortal reverberations through The States,I 
will give an example to lovers, to take permanent shape 
and will through The States;Through me shall the words be 
said to make death exhilarating;Give me your tone therefore, O 
Death, that I may ac- cord with it,Give me yourself—for 
I see that you belong to me now above all, 
and are folded inseparably together— you Love and Death are;Nor 
will I allow you to balk me any more with 
what I was calling life,For now it is convey'd to 
me that you are the purports essential,That you hide in 
these shifting forms of life, for reasons —and that they 
are mainly for you,That you, beyond them, come forth, to 
remain, the real reality,That behind the mask of materials you 
patiently wait, no matter how long,That you will one day, 
perhaps, take control of all,That you will perhaps dissipate this 
entire show of appearance,That may-be you are what it is 
all for—but it does not last so very long;But you 
will last very long. Whoever you are, Holding me now 
in Hand.1 WHOEVER you are, holding me now in hand,Without 
one thing, all will be useless;I give you fair warning, 
before you attempt me further,I am not what you supposed, 
but far different.2 Who is he that would become my 
follower?Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?3 The 
way is suspicious—the result uncertain, perhaps destructive;You would have to 
give up all else—I alone would ex- pect to be 
your God, sole and exclusive,Your novitiate would even then be 
long and exhausting,The whole past theory of your life, and 
all conformity to the lives around you, would have to 
be aban- don'd;Therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any
