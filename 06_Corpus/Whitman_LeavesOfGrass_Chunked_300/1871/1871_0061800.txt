heat—this strange extatic fever of dreams, O years!Your dreams, O 
years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether 
I sleep or wake!)The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, 
retiring in shadow behind me,The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, 
advance, ad- vance upon me. THOUGHTS.1OF these years I sing,How 
they pass and have pass'd, through convuls'd pains, as through 
parturitions;How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure 
fulfillment, the Absolute Suc- cess, despite of people—Illustrates evil as

love them;How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil 
with good, the sounding and resounding, keep on and on;How 
society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things 
ended and things begun;How America is the continent of glories, 
and of the triumph of freedom, and of the Democracies, 
and of the fruits of society, and of all that 
is begun;And how The States are complete in themselves—And how 
all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves, to lead 
onward,And how these of mine, and of The States, will 
in their turn be convuls'd, and serve other parturitions and 
transitions,And how all people, sights, combinations, the Demo- cratic masses, 
too, serve—and how every fact, and war itself, with all 
its horrors, serves,And how now, or at any time, each 
serves the exquisite transition of death.2OF seeds dropping into the 
ground—of birth,Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to
