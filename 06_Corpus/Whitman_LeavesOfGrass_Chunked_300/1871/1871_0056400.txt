yellow maize-stalk—the lilacs bloom in the door-yards;The summer growth is 
innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead.5 
What chemistry!That the winds are really not infectious,That this is 
no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which is 
so amorous after me,That it is safe to allow it 
to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,That 
it will not endanger me with the fevers that have 
deposited themselves in it,That all is clean forever and forever,That 
the cool drink from the well tastes so good,That blackberries

of grass rises out of what was once a catching 
disease.36 Now I am terrified at the Earth! it is 
that calm and patient,It grows such sweet things out of 
such corruptions,It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with 
such endless successions of diseas'd corpses,It distils such exquisite winds 
out of such infused fetor,It renews with such unwitting looks, 
its prodigal, an- nual, sumptuous crops,It gives such divine materials 
to men, and accepts such leavings from them at last.

ages, that men and women like us grew up and 
travel'd their course, and pass'd on;What vast-built cities—what orderly republics—what 
pastoral tribes and nomads;What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all 
others;What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions;What sort of marriage—what costumes—what 
physi- ology and phrenology;What of liberty and slavery among them—what 
they thought of death and the soul;Who were witty and 
wise—who beautiful and poetic— who brutish and undevelop'd;Not a mark,
