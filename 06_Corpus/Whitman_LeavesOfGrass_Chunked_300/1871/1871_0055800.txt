perhaps in time toward denser wars,Perhaps to engage in time 
in still more dreadful con- tests, dangers,Longer campaigns and crises, 
labors beyond all others;)—As I walk, solitary, unattended,Around me I 
hear that eclat of the world—politics, produce,The announcements of recognized 
things—science,The approved growth of cities, and the spread of inven- 
tions.2 I see the ships (they will last a few 
years,)The vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,And hear the 
endorsement of all, and do not object to it.3 But 
I too announce solid things;Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are

not what the use, O life! nor know the aim, 
the end—nor really aught we know;But know the work, the 
need goes on, and shall go on— the death-envelop'd march 
of peace as well as war goes on;)For great campaigns 
of peace the same, the wiry threads to weave;We know
