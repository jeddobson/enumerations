and pallid earth.28 A shroud I see, and I am 
the shroud—I wrap a body, and lie in the coffin,It 
is dark here under ground—it is not evil or pain 
here —it is blank here, for reasons.29 It seems to 
me that everything in the light and air ought to 
be happy,Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark

I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,I can but rush 
to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze 
upon me.37 I search with the crowd—not one of the 
company is wash'd to us alive;In the morning I help
