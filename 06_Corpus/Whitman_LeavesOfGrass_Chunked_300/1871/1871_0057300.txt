ground,Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoul- ders;At 
her feet fallen an unused royal harp,Long silent—she too long 
silent—mourning her shroud- ed hope and heir;Of all the earth 
her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of 
love.2 Yet a word, ancient mother;You need crouch there no 
longer on the cold ground, with forehead between your knees;O 
you need not sit there, veil'd in your old white 
hair, so dishevel'd;For know you, the one you mourn is 
not in that grave;It was an illusion—the heir, the son 
you love, was not really dead;The Lord is not dead—he 
is risen again, young and strong, in another country;Even while

you wept for, was translated, pass'd from the grave,The winds 
favor'd, and the sea sail'd it,And now with rosy and 
new blood,Moves to-day in a new country. To ORATISTS.1 TO

these broad lands as broad as they?Come duly to the 
divine power to use words?3 For only at last, after 
many years—after chastity, friendship, procreation, prudence, and nakedness;After treading ground 
and breasting river and lake;After a loosen'd throat—after absorbing eras, 
tempera- ments, races—after knowledge, freedom, crimes;After complete faith—after clarifyings, elevations, 
and removing obstructions;After these, and more, it is just possible 
there comes to a man, a woman, the divine power 
to use words.4 Then toward that man or that woman, 
swiftly hasten all—None refuse, all attend;Armies, ships, antiquities, the dead, 
libraries, paintings, machines, cities, hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, 
aspiration, form in close ranks; BATHED IN WAR'S PERFUME. BATHED
