out of my love- spendings,I shall expect them to interpenetrate 
with others as I and you interpenetrate now,I shall count 
on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as 
I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I 
give now,I shall look for loving crops from the birth,

up and down—that gripes the full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her 
with amorous firm legs, takes his will of her, and
