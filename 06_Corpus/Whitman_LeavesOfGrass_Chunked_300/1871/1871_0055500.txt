you had one single hour through your whole life?)Let the 
limited years of life do nothing for the limitless years 
of death! (What do you suppose death will do, then?) 
TURN, O LIBERTAD.TURN, O Libertad, for the war is over,(From 
it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute, sweeping 
the world,)Turn from lands retrospective, recording proofs of the past;From 
the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past;From 
the chants of the feudal world—the triumphs of kings, slavery,

fiercer, weightier battles give expression. As I Walk These Broad, 
Majestic Days.1 As I walk these broad, majestic days of 
peace,(For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O 
terrific Ideal!Against vast odds, having gloriously won,Now thou stridest on—yet
