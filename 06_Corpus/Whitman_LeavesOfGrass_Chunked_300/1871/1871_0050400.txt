decay of the ruggedness of states and men.518 Ages, precedents, 
have long been accumulating undi- rected materials,America brings builders, and 
brings its own styles.19 The immortal poets of Asia and 
Europe have done their work, and pass'd to other spheres,A 
work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.20 
America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at 
all hazards,Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound—initiates the true use of 
precedents,Does not repel them, or the past, or what they 
have produced under their forms,Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives 
the corpse slowly borne from the house,Perceives that it waits 
a little while in the door—that it was fittest for 
its days,That its life has descended to the stalwart and 
well- shaped heir who approaches,And that he shall be fittest 
for his days.21 Any period, one nation must lead,One land 
must be the promise and reliance of the future.22 These 
States are the amplest poem,Here is not merely a nation, 
but a teeming nation of nations,Here the doings of men 
correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night,Here 
is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,Here are 
the roughs, beards, friendliness, combative- ness, the Soul loves,Here the 
flowing trains—here the crowds, equality, diversity, the Soul loves.623 Land 
of lands, and bards to corroborate!Of them, standing among them, 
one lifts to the light his west-bred face,To him the 
hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and father's,His first parts substances, 
earth, water, animals, trees,Built of the common stock, having room 
for far and near,Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating 
this land,Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on 
its neck with incomparable love,Plunging his seminal muscle into its 
merits and de- merits,Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, 
vocal in him,Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,Mississippi
