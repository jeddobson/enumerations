faithful?Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before 
me?)1547 I swear I begin to see the meaning of 
these things!It is not the earth, it is not America, 
who is so great,It is I who am great, or 
to be great—it is you up there, or any one;It 
is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,Through poems, pageants, 
shows, to form great indi- viduals.48 Underneath all, individuals!I swear 
nothing is good to me now that ignores indi- viduals,The 
American compact is altogether with individuals,The only government is that 
which makes minute of individuals,The whole theory of the universe 
is directed to one single individual—namely, to You.49 (Mother! with 
subtle sense severe—with the naked sword in your hand,I saw 
you at last refuse to treat but directly with indi- 
viduals.)1650 Underneath all, nativity,I swear I will stand by my 
own nativity—pious or im- pious, so be it;I swear I 
am charm'd with nothing except nativity,Men, women, cities, nations, are 
only beautiful from nativity.51 Underneath all is the need of 
the expression of love for men and women,I swear I 
have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing 
love for men and women,After this day I take my 
own modes of expressing love for men and women.52 I 
swear I will have each quality of my race in 
my- self,(Talk as you like, he only suits These States 
whose manners favor the audacity and sublime turbu- lence of 
The States.)53 Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments, 
ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,Underneath all, to me 
is myself—to you, yourself—(the same monotonous old song.)1754 O I 
see now, flashing, that this America is only you and 
me,Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and meIts crimes, lies, 
thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,Its Congress is you
