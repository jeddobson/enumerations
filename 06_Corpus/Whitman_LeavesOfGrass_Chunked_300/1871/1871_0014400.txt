waves,Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,Delicate sniffs 
of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the 
shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,The hiss of the 
surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,Wheeze, cluck, swash 
of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering 
groan;These so—these irretrievable.37238 O Christ! This is mastering me!In at 
the conquer'd doors they crowd. I am possess'd.239 I embody 
all presences outlaw'd or suffering;See myself in prison shaped like 
another man,And feel the dull unintermitted pain.240 For me the 
keepers of convicts shoulder their car- bines and keep watch;It 
is I let out in the morning, and barr'd at 
night.241 Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail, but I 
am handcuff'd to him and walk by his side;(I am 
less the jolly one there, and more the silent one, 
with sweat on my twitching lips.)242 Not a youngster is 
taken for larceny, but I go up too, and am 
tried and sentenced.243 Not a cholera patient lies at the 
last gasp, but I also lie at the last gasp;My 
face is ash-color'd—my sinews gnarl—away from me people retreat.244 Askers 
embody themselves in me, and I am embo- died in 
them;I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.245 Enough! enough! 
enough!Somehow I have been stunn'd, Stand back!Give me a little 
time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping;I discover myself 
on the verge of a usual mistake.246 That I could 
forget the mockers and insults!That I could forget the trickling 
tears, and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!That I 
could look with a separate look on my own cru- 
cifixion and bloody crowning.247 I remember now;I resume the overstaid 
fraction;The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to 
it, or to any graves;Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll
