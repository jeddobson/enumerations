armies, needing fleets, come again,)O to hear you call the 
sailors and the soldiers! flag like a beautiful woman!O to 
hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men! O 
the ships they arm with joy!O to see you leap 
and beckon from the tall masts of ships!O to see 
you peering down on the sailors on the decks!Flag like 
the eyes of women. DELICATE CLUSTER.DELICATE cluster! flag of teeming 
life!Covering all my lands! all my sea-shores lining!Flag of death! 
(how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle pressing!How 
I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)Flag cerulean! sunny 
flag! with the orbs of night dap- pled!Ah my silvery 
beauty! ah my woolly white and crim- son!Ah to sing 
the song of you, my matron mighty!My sacred one, my 
mother. SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAY-BREAK.POET.1 O A new 
song, a free song,Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by 
voices clearer,By the wind's voice and that of the drum,By 
the banner's voice, and child's voice, and sea's voice, and 
father's voice,Low on the ground and high in the air,On 
the ground where father and child stand,In the upward air 
where their eyes turn,Where the banner at day-break is flapping.2 
Words! book-words! what are you?Words no more, for hearken and 
see,My song is there in the open air—and I must 
sing,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.3 I'll weave the cord 
and twine in,Man's desire and babe's desire—I'll twine them in, 
I'll put in life;I'll put the bayonet's flashing point—I'll let 
bullets and slugs whizz;(As one carrying a symbol and menace, 
far into the future,Crying with trumpet voice, Arouse and beware! 
Beware and arouse! )I'll pour the verse with streams of 
blood, full of voli- tion, full of joy;Then loosen, launch 
forth, to go and compete,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.PENNANT.4
