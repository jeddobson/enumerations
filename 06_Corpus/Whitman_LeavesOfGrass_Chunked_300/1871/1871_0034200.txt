their reach'd hands towards you.1241 Allons! after the GREAT COMPANIONS! 
and to belong to them!They too are on the road! 
they are the swift and ma- jestic men! they are 
the greatest women.42 Over that which hinder'd them—over that which 
re- tarded—passing impediments large or small,Committers of crimes, committers of 
many beautiful virtues,Enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of 
seas,Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile 
of land,Habitus of many distant countries, habitus of far- distant 
dwellings,Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,Pausers 
and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,Dancers at 
wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of 
children,Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers down of 
coffins,Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years— the curious years, 
each emerging from that which preceded it,Journeyers as with companions, 
namely, their own diverse phases,Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,Journeyers 
gayly with their own youth—Journeyers with their bearded and well-grain'd 
manhood,Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,Journeyers with their own 
sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,Old age, calm, expanded, 
broad with the haughty breadth of the universe,Old age, flowing 
free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.1343 Allons! to 
that which is endless, as it was begin- ningless,To undergo 
much, tramps of days, rests of nights,To merge all in 
the travel they tend to, and the days and nights 
they tend to,Again to merge them in the start of 
superior journeys;To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach 
it and pass it,To conceive no time, however distant, but 
what you may reach it and pass it,To look up 
or down no road but it stretches and waits for 
you—however long, but it stretches and waits for you;To see 
no being, not God's or any, but you also go
