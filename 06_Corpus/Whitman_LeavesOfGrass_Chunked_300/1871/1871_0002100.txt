not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the 
essential life of the earth,Any more than such are to 
Religion.1031 What do you seek, so pensive and silent?What do 
you need, Camerado?Dear son! do you think it is love?32 
Listen, dear son—listen, America, daughter or son!It is a painful 
thing to love a man or woman to excess —and 
yet it satisfies—it is great;But there is something else very 
great—it makes the whole coincide;It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous 
hands, sweeps and provides for all.1133 Know you! solely to 
drop in the earth the germs of a greater Religion,The 
following chants, each for its kind, I sing.34 My comrade!For 
you, to share with me, two greatnesses—and a third one, 
rising inclusive and more resplendent,The greatness of Love and Democracy—and 
the great- ness of Religion.35 Melange mine own! the unseen 
and the seen;Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;Prophetic spirit of 
materials shifting and flickering around me;Living beings, identities, now doubtless 
near us, in the air, that we know not of;Contact 
daily and hourly that will not release me;These selecting—these, in 
hints, demanded of me.36 Not he, with a daily kiss, 
onward from childhood kissing me,Has winded and twisted around me 
that which holds me to him,Any more than I am 
held to the heavens, to the spir- itual world,And to 
the identities of the Gods, my lovers, faithful and true,After 
what they have done to me, suggesting themes.37 O such 
themes! Equalities!O amazement of things! O divine average!O warblings under 
the sun—usher'd, as now, at noon, or setting!O strain, musical, 
flowing through ages—now reaching hither!I take to your reckless and 
composite chords—I add to them, and cheerfully pass them forward.1238 
As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walkI have 
seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, sat on her nest
