escape me, and none shall wish to escape me.16 I 
bring what you much need, yet always have,Not money, amours, 
dress, eating, but as good;I send no agent or medium, 
offer no representative of value, but offer the value itself.17 
There is something that comes home to one now and 
perpetually;It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed—it eludes discussion 
and print;It is not to be put in a book—it 
is not in this book;It is for you, whoever you 
are—it is no farther from you than your hearing and 
sight are from you;It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest—it 
is ever provoked by them.18 You may read in many 
languages, yet read nothing about it;You may read the President's 
Message, and read noth- ing about it there;Nothing in the 
reports from the State department or Treasury department, or in 
the daily papers or the weekly papers,Or in the census 
or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of stock.419 
The sun and stars that float in the open air;The 
apple-shaped earth, and we upon it—surely the drift of them 
is something grand!I do not know what it is, except 
that it is grand, and that it is happiness,And that 
the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, 
or bon-mot, or reconnoissance,And that it is not something which 
by luck may turn out well for us, and without 
luck must be a failure for us,And not something which 
may yet be retracted in a certain contingency.20 The light 
and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the 
greed that with perfect complais- ance devours all things, the 
endless pride and out-stretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,The 
wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, 
and the wonders that fill each minute of time forever,
