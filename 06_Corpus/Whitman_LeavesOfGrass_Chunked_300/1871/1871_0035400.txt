in of the flood-tide, the falling back to the sea 
of the ebb-tide.35 It avails not, neither time or place—distance 
avails not;I am with you, you men and women of 
a generation, or ever so many generations hence;I project myself—also 
I return—I am with you, and know how it is.6 
Just as you feel when you look on the river 
and sky, so I felt;Just as any of you is

centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head 
in the sun-lit water,Look'd on the haze on the hills

notice the arriving ships,Saw their approach, saw aboard those that 
were near me,Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops—saw 
the ships at anchor,The sailors at work in the rigging, 
or out astride the spars,The round masts, the swinging motion
