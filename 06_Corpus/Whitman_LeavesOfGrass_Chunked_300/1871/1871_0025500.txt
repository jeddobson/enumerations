all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!Need 
I that you exist and show yourself, any more than 
in these songs. OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.OF the 
terrible doubt of appearances,Of the uncertainty after all—that we may 
be deluded,That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after 
all,That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable 
only,May-be the things I perceive—the animals, plants, men, hills, shining

hand,When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words 
and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,Then I 
am charged with untold and untellable wisdom —I am silent—I 
require nothing further,I cannot answer the question of appearances, or 
that of identity beyond the grave;But I walk or sit

me. The Base of all Metaphysics.1 AND now, gentlemen,A word 
I give to remain in your memories and minds,As base, 
and finale too, for all metaphysics.2 (So, to the students, 
the old professor,At the close of his crowded course.)3 Having
