with me, and the pains of hell are with me;The 
first I graft and increase upon myself—the latter I translate 
into a new tongue.108 I am the poet of the 
woman the same as the man;And I say it is 
as great to be a woman as to be a 
man;And I say there is nothing greater than the mother 
of men.100 I chant the chant of dilation or pride;We

you mean;I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers;I 
believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;We 
must have a turn together—I undress—hurry me out of sight 
of the land;Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse;Dash 
me with amorous wet—I can repay you.116 Sea of stretch'd 
ground-swells!Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!Sea of the brine of
