well to me;And the look of the bay mare shames 
silliness out of me.1472 The wild gander leads his flock 
through the cool night; Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it

sky to come down to my good will;Scattering it freely 
forever.1577 The pure contralto sings in the organ loft;The carpenter

are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar;The spinning-girl retreats 
and advances to the hum of the big wheel;The farmer 
stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-
