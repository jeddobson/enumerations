had lately risen,And the school-mistress that pass'd on her way 
to the school,And the friendly boys that pass'd—and the quarrelsome 
boys,And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls—and the barefoot negro boy 
and girl,And all the changes of city and country, wherever 
he went.4 His own parents,He that had father'd him, and 
she had conceiv'd him in her womb, and birth'd him,They 
gave this child more of themselves than that;They gave him 
afterward every day—they became part of him.5 The mother at 
home, quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table;The mother with 
mild words—clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor falling 
off her person and clothes as she walks by;The father, 
strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust;The blow, the quick loud

the windows,Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves—the huge crossing at the 
ferries,The village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset— 
the river between,Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on 
roofs and gables of white or brown, three miles off,The 
schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide —the little 
boat slack-tow'd astern,The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,The strata 
of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon- tint, away 
solitary by itself—the spread of purity it lies motionless in,The 
horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh
