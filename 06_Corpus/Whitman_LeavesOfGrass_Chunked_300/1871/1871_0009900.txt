veil'd, and I remove the veil;Voices indecent, by me clarified 
and transfigur'd.140 I do not press my fingers across my 
mouth;I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the 
head and heart;Copulation is no more rank to me than 
death is.141 I believe in the flesh and the appetites;Seeing, 
hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of 
me is a miracle.142 Divine am I inside and out,

generous, it shall be you!Vapors lighting and shading my face, 
it shall be you!You sweaty brooks and dews, it shall 
be you!Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me, it shall 
be you!Broad, muscular fields! branches of live oak! loving lounger 
in my winding paths! it shall be you!Hands I have 
taken—face I have kiss'd—mortal I have ever touch'd! it shall 
be you.149 I dote on myself—there is that lot of 
me, and all so luscious;Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills
