be changed so much, nor the law of us changed, 
I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under 
the present and past law, And that murderers, drunkards, liars, 
shall be under the present and past law, For I 
have dream'd that the law they are under now is

thing without exception has an eternal soul! The trees have, 
rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! 
the animals! I swear I think there is nothing but 
immortality!That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous 
float is for it, and the cohering is for it! 
And all preparation is for it—and identity is for it—and 
life and materials are altogether for it! 338 WHISPERS OF
