steep,Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,Pioneers! 
O pioneers!We primeval forests felling,We the rivers stemming, vexing we 
and piercing deep the mines within, We the surface broad

varied pageants,All the forms and shows, all the workmen at 
their work,All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters
