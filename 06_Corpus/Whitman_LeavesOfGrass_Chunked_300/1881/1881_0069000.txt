soul.There ponder'd, felt I,If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to 
sweet spiritual songs be turn'd, If vermin so transposed, so 
used and bless'd may be,Then may I trust in you, 
your fortunes, days, my country;Who knows but these may be

keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix'd house,It 
is round, it is only a few inches from one 
side to the other;Yet behold, it has room for all 
the shows of the world, all memo- ries! Here the
