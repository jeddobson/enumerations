arm'd men hasten—lo, mid the clouds of dust the glint 
of bayonets, I see the grime-faced cannoneers, I mark the 
rosy flash amid the smoke, I hear the cracking of 
the guns; Nor war alone—thy fearful music-song, wild player, brings 
every sight of fear, The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, 
murder—I hear the cries for help! I see ships foundering 
at sea, I behold on deck and below deck the 
terrible tableaus. O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument 
thou playest,Thou melt'st my heart, my brain—thou movest, drawest, chan- 
gest them at will; And now thy sullen notes send 
darkness through me,Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope,I 
see the enslaved, the overthrown, the hurt, the opprest of 
the whole earth, I feel the measureless shame and humiliation 
of my race, it becomes all mine, Mine too the 
revenges of humanity, the wrongs of ages, baffled feuds and 
hatreds, Utter defeat upon me weighs—all lost—the foe victorious,(Yet 'mid 
the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last,Endurance, resolution 
to the last.)Now trumpeter for thy close,Vouchsafe a higher strain 
than any yet,Sing to my soul, renew its languishing faith 
and hope,Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision 
of the future,Give me for once its prophecy and joy.O 
glad, exulting, culminating song!A vigor more than earth's is in 
thy notes,Marches of victory—man disenthral'd—the conqueror at last,Hymns to the 
universal God from universal man—all joy!A reborn race appears—a perfect 
world, all joy!Women and men in wisdom innocence and health—all 
joy!Riotous laughing bacchanals fill'd with joy!War, sorrow, suffering gone—the rank 
earth purged—nothing but joy left! The ocean fill'd with joy—the 
atmosphere all joy!Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in 
the ecstasy of life!Enough to merely be! enough to breathe!Joy! 
joy! all over joy! TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN WINTER.THEE for
