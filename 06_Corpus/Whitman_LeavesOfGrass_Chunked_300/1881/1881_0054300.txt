long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,With the 
countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and 
the unbared heads, With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, 
and the sombre faces,With dirges through the night, with the 
thousand voices rising strong and solemn, With all the mournful 
voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,The dim-lit churches 
and the shuddering organsâ€”where amid these you journey, With the 
tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,Here, coffin that slowly passes,I give 
you my sprig of lilac.(Nor for you, for one alone,Blossoms 
and branches green to coffins all I bring,For fresh as 
the morning, thus would I chant a song for you 
O sane and sacred death. All over bouquets of roses,O 
death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,But 
mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,Copious I 
break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,With loaded arms 
I come, pouring for you,For you and the coffins all 
of you O death.)O western orb sailing the heaven,Now I 
know what you must have meant as a month since 
I walk'd, As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy 
night,As I saw you had something to tell as you 
bent to me night after night, As you droop'd from 
the sky low down as if to my side, (while 
the other stars all look'd on,) As we wander'd together 
the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept 
me from sleep,) As the night advanced, and I saw 
on the rim of the west how full you were 
of woe, As I stood on the rising ground in 
the breeze in the cool trans- parent night, As I 
watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward 
black of the night, As my soul in its trouble
