up,In its eidólon.The old, old urge,Based on the ancient pinnacles, 
lo, newer, higher pinnacles,From science and the modern still impell'd,The 
old, old urge, eidólons.The present now and here,America's busy, teeming, 
intricate whirl,Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,To-day's eidólons.These 
with the past,Of vanish'd lands, of all the reigns of 
kings across the sea,Old conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors' voyages,Joining 
eidólons.Densities, growth, façades,Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,Far-born, far-dying, 
living long, to leave,Eidólons everlasting.Exaltè, rapt, ecstatic,The visible but their 
womb of birth,Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and 
shape,The mighty earth-eidólon.All space, all time,(The stars, the terrible perturbations 
of the suns,Swelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)Fill'd 
with eidólons only.The noiseless myriads,The infinite oceans where the rivers 
empty,The separate countless free identities, like eyesight,The true realities, eidólons.Not 
this the world,Nor these the universes, they the universes,Purport and 
end, ever the permanent life of life,Eidólons, eidólons.Beyond thy lectures 
learn'd professor,Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen, beyond all 
mathematics, Beyond the doctor's surgery, anatomy, beyond the chemist with 
his chemistry, The entities of entities, eidólons.Unfix'd yet fix'd,Ever shall 
be, ever have been and are,Sweeping the present to the 
infinite future,Eidólons, eidólons, eidólons.The prophet and the bard,Shall yet maintain 
themselves, in higher stages yet,Shall mediate to the Modern, to 
Democracy, interpret yet to them,God and eidólons.And thee my soul,Joys, 
ceaseless exercises, exaltations,Thy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to 
meet,Thy mates, eidólons.Thy body permanent,The body lurking there within thy 
body,The only purport of the form thou art, the real 
I myself,An image, an eidólon.Thy very songs not in thy 
songs,No special strains to sing, none for itself,But from the 
whole resulting, rising at last and floating,A round full-orb'd eidólon. 
FOR HIM I SING.FOR him I sing,I raise the present 
on the past,(As some perennial tree out of its roots,
