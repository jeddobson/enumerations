and large as these and thee, Thou! mounting higher, diving 
deeper than we knew, thou transcendental Union! By thee fact 
to be justified, blended with thought,Thought of man justified, blended 
with God,Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!Through thy reality, 
lo, the immortal idea!3Brain of the New World, what a 
task is thine,To formulate the Modern—out of the peerless grandeur 
of the modern, Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast 
poems, churches, art,(Recast, may-be discard them, end them—may-be their work 
is done, who knows?) By vision, hand, conception, on the 
background of the mighty past, the dead, To limn with 
absolute faith the mighty living present.And yet thou living present 
brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain, Thou 
that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds 
so long,Thou carefully prepared by it so long—haply thou but 
unfoldest it, only maturest it, It to eventuate in thee—the 
essence of the by-gone time contain'd in thee, Its poems, 
churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with reference to thee; 
Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,The fruit of 
all the Old ripening to-day in thee.4Sail, sail thy best, 
ship of Democracy,Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the 
Present only,The Past is also stored in thee,Thou holdest not 
the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western continent 
alone, Earth's résumé entire floats on thy keel O ship, 
is steadied by thy spars, With thee Time voyages in 
trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim with thee, With 
all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou bear'st 
the other continents, Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the 
destination-port triumphant;Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye 
O helmsman, thou carriest great companions, Venerable priestly Asia sails 
this day with thee,And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.5Beautiful
