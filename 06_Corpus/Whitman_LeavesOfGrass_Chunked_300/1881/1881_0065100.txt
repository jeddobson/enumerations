for thee, O millionnaire?The life thou lived'st we know not,But 
that thou walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts 
of brokers, Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory.Silent, my 
soul,With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd,Turning from all the samples, 
monuments of heroes.While through the interior vistas,Noiseless uprose, phantasmic, (as 
by night Auroras of the north,)Lambent tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes,Spiritual 
projections.In one, among the city streets a laborer's home appear'd,After 
his day's work done, cleanly, sweet-air'd, the gaslight burning,The carpet 
swept and a fire in the cheerful stove.In one, the 
sacred parturition scene,A happy painless mother birth'd a perfect child.In 
one, at a bounteous morning meal,Sat peaceful parents with contented 
sons.In one, by twos and threes, young people,Hundreds concentring, walk'd 
the paths and streets and roads,Toward a tall-domed school.In one 
a trio beautiful,Grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat,Chatting and 
sewing.In one, along a suite of noble rooms,'Mid plenteous books 
and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes, Were groups 
of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old,Reading, conversing.All, all the 
shows of laboring life,City and country, women's, men's and children's,Their 
wants provided for, hued in the sun and tinged for 
once with joy, Marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the 
house-room, lodging- room, Labor and toil, the bath, gymnasium, playground, 
library, college,The student, boy or girl, led forward to be 
taught,The sick cared for, the shoeless shod, the orphan father'd 
and mother'd, The hungry fed, the houseless housed;(The intentions perfect 
and divine,The workings, details, haply human.)O thou within this tomb,From 
thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver,Tallying the gifts of 
earth, large as the earth,Thy name an earth, with mountains, 
fields and tides.Nor by your streams alone, you rivers,By you, 
your banks Connecticut,By you and all your teeming life old 
Thames,By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you
