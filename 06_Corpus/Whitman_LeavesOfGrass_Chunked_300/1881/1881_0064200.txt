body and soul the same,Who perceives the indirect assuredly following 
the direct,Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither

of the land, (There by the hundreds seated, sear-faced murderers, 
wily counter- feiters, Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls, 
the keepers round,Plenteous, well-armed, watching with vigilant eyes,)Calmly a lady
