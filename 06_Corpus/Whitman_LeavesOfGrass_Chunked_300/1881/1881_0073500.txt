money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,And the enraged and treacherous 
dispositions, all, all sleep.I stand in the dark with drooping 
eyes by the worst-suffering and the most restless, I pass 
my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from 
them,The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.Now I 
pierce the darkness, new beings appear,The earth recedes from me

to signify me with stretch'd arms, and resume the way; 
Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting 
music and wild-flapping pennants of joy! I am the actor, 
the actress, the voter, the politician,The emigrant and the exile, 
the criminal that stood in the box,He who has been 
famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,The stammerer, 
the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person. I am 
she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,My truant 
lover has come, and it is dark.Double yourself and receive
