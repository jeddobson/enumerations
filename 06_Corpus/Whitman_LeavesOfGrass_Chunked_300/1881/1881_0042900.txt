lop- tongued wolves, not reasoning men, And in its stead 
speed industry's campaigns,With thy undaunted armies, engineering,Thy pennants labor, loosen'd 
to the breeze,Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.Away with old 
romance!Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,Away with 
love-verses sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues, amours of idlers, Fitted 
for only banquets of the night where dancers to late 
music slide, The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few,With 
perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.To you ye 
reverent sane sisters,I raise a voice for far superber themes 
for poets and for art,To exalt the present and the 
real,To teach the average man the glory of his daily 
walk and trade,To sing in songs how exercise and chemical 
life are never to be baffled, To manual work for 
each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,To plant and tend 
the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,For every man to see 
to it that he really do something, for every woman 
too; To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or 
cross-cut,)To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,To work as 
tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,To invent a little, something ingenious, 
to aid the washing, cook- ing, cleaning, And hold it 
no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.I say 
I bring thee Muse to-day and here,All occupations, duties broad 
and close,Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,The old, 
old practical burdens, interests, joys,The family, parentage, childhood, husband and 
wife,The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,Food and 
its preservation, chemistry applied to it,Whatever forms the average, strong, 
complete, sweet-blooded man or woman, the perfect longeve personality, And 
helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes 
its soul,For the eternal real life to come.With latest connections, 
works, the inter-transportation of the world,Steam-power, the great express lines,
