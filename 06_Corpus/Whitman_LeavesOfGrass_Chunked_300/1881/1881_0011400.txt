oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be 
you! Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal 
I have ever touch'd, it shall be you. I dote 
on myself, there is that lot of me and all 
so luscious,Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,I 
cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause 
of my faintest wish, Nor the cause of the friendship 
I emit, nor the cause of the friend- ship I 
take again. That I walk up my stoop, I pause 
to consider if it really be,A morning-glory at my window 
satisfies me more than the meta- physics of books. To 
behold the day-break!The little light fades the immense and diaphanous 
shadows,The air tastes good to my palate.Hefts of the moving 
world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding, Scooting obliquely 
high and low.Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,Seas 
of bright juice suffuse heaven.The earth by the sky staid 
with, the daily close of their junction,The heav'd challenge from 
the east that moment over my head,The mocking taunt. See 
then whether you shall be master!25Dazzling and tremendous how quick 
the sun-rise would kill me,If I could not now and 
always send sun-rise out of me.We also ascend dazzling and 
tremendous as the sun,We found our own O my soul 
in the calm and cool of the day- break. My 
voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,With the twirl 
of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds. 
Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal 
to measure itself,It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically, Walt 
you contain enough, why don't you let it out then? 
Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too 
much of articulation, Do you not know O speech how
