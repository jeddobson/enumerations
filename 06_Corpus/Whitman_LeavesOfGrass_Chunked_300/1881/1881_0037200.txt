not—we love you—there is perfection in you also,You furnish your 
parts toward eternity,Great or small, you furnish your parts toward 
the soul. 134 SONG OF THE ANSWERER.1NOW list to my 
morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,To the 
cities and farms I sing as they spread in the 
sunshine before me. A young man comes to me bearing 
a message from his brother,How shall the young man know 
the whether and when of his brother? Tell him to 
send me the signs.And I stand before the young man 
face to face, and take his right hand in my 
left hand and his left hand in my right hand, 
And I answer for his brother and for men, and 
I answer for him that answers for all, and send 
these signs. Him all wait for, him all yield up 
to, his word is decisive and final,Him they accept, in 
him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light, Him 
they immerse and he immerses them.Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, 
laws, the landscape, people, animals, The profound earth and its 
attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so tell I my morning's 
romanza,) All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money 
will buy, The best farms, others toiling and planting and 
he unavoidably reaps, The noblest and costliest cities, others grading 
and building and he domiciles there, Nothing for any one 
but what is for him, near and far are for 
him, the ships in the offing, The perpetual shows and 
marches on land are for him if they are for 
anybody. He puts things in their attitudes,He puts to-day out 
of himself with plasticity and love,He places his own times, 
reminiscences, parents, brothers and sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that 
the rest never shame them afterward, nor assume to command
