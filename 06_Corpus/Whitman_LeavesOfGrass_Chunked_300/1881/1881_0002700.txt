America, take them South and take them North,Make welcome for 
them everywhere, for they are your own off- spring, Surround 
them East and West, for they would surround you,And you 
precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly with 
you. I conn'd old times,I sat studying at the feet 
of the great masters,Now if eligible O that the great 
masters might return and study me.In the name of these 
States shall I scorn the antique?Why these are the children 
of the antique to justify it.5Dead poets, philosophs, priests,Martyrs, artists, 
inventors, governments long since,Language-shapers on other shores,Nations once powerful, now 
reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,I dare not proceed till I respectfully 
credit what you have left wafted hither, I have perused 
it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)Think nothing 
can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more than 
it deserves, Regarding it all intently a long while, then 
dismissing it,I stand in my place with my own day 
here.Here lands female and male,Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of 
the world, here the flame of materials, Here spirituality the 
translatress, the openly-avow'd,The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms,The satisfier, 
after due long-waiting now advancing,Yes here comes my mistress the 
soul.6The soul,Forever and forever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer 
than water ebbs and flows. I will make the poems 
of materials, for I think they are to be the 
most spiritual poems, And I will make the poems of 
my body and of mortality,For I think I shall then 
supply myself with the poems of my soul and of 
immortality. I will make a song for these States that 
no one State may under any circumstances be subjected to 
another State, And I will make a song that there 
shall be comity by day and by night between all
