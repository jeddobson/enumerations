one side of me,And the thought of death close-walking the 
other side of me,And I in the middle as with 
companions, and as holding the hands of companions, I fled 
forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,Down to 
the shores of the water, the path by the swamp 
in the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly 
pines so still.And the singer so shy to the rest 
receiv'd me,The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,And

always gliding near with soft feet,Have none chanted for thee 
a chant of fullest welcome?Then I chant it for thee, 
I glorify thee above all,I bring thee a song that 
when thou must indeed come, come unfal- teringly. Approach strong 
deliveress,When it is so, when thou hast taken them I 
joyously sing the dead,Lost in the loving floating ocean of 
thee,Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.From me 
to thee glad serenades,Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, 
adornments and feast- ings for thee, And the sights of 
the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, And 
life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.The
