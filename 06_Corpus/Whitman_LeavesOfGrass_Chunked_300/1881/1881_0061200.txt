herby-perfumed breezes,And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the 
ever-recurring grass. Toil on heroes! harvest the products!Not alone on 
those warlike fields the Mother of All,With dilated form and 
lambent eyes watch'd you.Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the

or hemp or tobacco in the Borders, Pick the pea 
and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or 
bunches of grapes from the vines, Or aught that ripens 
in all these States or North or South,Under the beaming
