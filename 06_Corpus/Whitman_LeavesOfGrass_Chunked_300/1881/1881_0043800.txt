work and workmen thine!None separate from thee—henceforth One only, we 
and thou,(For the blood of the children, what is it, 
only the blood maternal? And lives and works, what are 
they all at last, except the roads to faith and 
death?) While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for 
thee, dear Mother, We own it all and several to-day 
indissoluble in thee;Think not our chant, our show, merely for 
products gross or lucre —it is for thee, the soul 
in thee, electric, spiritual! Our farms, inventions, crops, we own 
in thee! cities and States in thee! Our freedom all 
in thee! our very lives in thee! 169 A SONG 
FOR OCCUPATIONS.1A SONG for occupations!In the labor of engines and 
trades and the labor of fields I find the developments, 
And find the eternal meanings.Workmen and Workwomen!Were all educations practical 
and ornamental well display'd out of me, what would it 
amount to? Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, 
wise statesman, what would it amount to? Were I to 
you as the boss employing and paying you, would that 
satisfy you? The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,A 
man like me and never the usual terms.Neither a servant 
nor a master I,I take no sooner a large price 
than a small price, I will have my own whoever 
enjoys me, I will be even with you and you 
shall be even with me.If you stand at work in 
a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in 
the same shop, If you bestow gifts on your brother 
or dearest friend I demand as good as your brother 
or dearest friend, If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome 
by day or night, I must be personally as welcome, 
If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so
