sounding, Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,Infinitesimals out 
of my life, and many a life,(For not my life 
and years alone I give—all, all I give,)These waifs from 
the deep, cast high and dry,Wash'd on America's shores? THE 
RETURN OF THE HEROES.FOR the lands and for these passionate 
days and for myself,Now I awhile retire to thee O 
soil of autumn fields,Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to 
thee,Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,Tuning a 
verse for thee.O earth that hast no voice, confide to 
me a voice,O harvest of my lands—O boundless summer growths,O 
lavish brown parturient earth—O infinite teeming womb,A song to narrate 
thee.Ever upon this stage,Is acted God's calm annual drama,Gorgeous processions, 
songs of birds,Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the 
soul,The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, 
strong waves, The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering 
trees,The liliput countless armies of the grass,The heat, the showers, 
the measureless pasturages,The scenery of the snows, the winds' free 
orchestra,The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and 
the silvery fringes, The high dilating stars, the placid beckoning 
stars,The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,The 
shows of all the varied lands and all the growths 
and products.Fecund America—to-day,Thou art all over set in births and 
joys!Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a 
swathing- garment, Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,A 
myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne, 
As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest 
into port, As rain falls from the heaven and vapors 
rise from earth, so have the precious values fallen upon 
thee and risen out of thee; Thou envy of the 
globe! thou miracle!Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,Thou lucky Mistress
