fine,Along the mighty labyrinth.4And thou America,For the scheme's culmination, its 
thought and its reality,For these (not for thyself) thou hast 
arrived.Thou too surroundest all,Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by 
pathways broad and new, To the ideal tendest.The measur'd faiths 
of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,Are not for 
thee, but grandeurs of thine own,Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, 
comprehending all,All eligible to all.All, all for immortality,Love like the 
light silently wrapping all,Nature's amelioration blessing all,The blossoms, fruits of 
ages, orchards divine and certain,Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual 
images ripening.Give me O God to sing that thought,Give me, 
give him or her I love this quenchless faith,In Thy 
ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,Belief in plan 
of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,Health, peace, salvation universal.Is 
it a dream?Nay but the lack of it the dream,And 
failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,And all the 
world a dream. PIONEERS! O PIONEERS!COME my tan-faced children,Follow well 
in order, get your weapons ready,Have you your pistols? have 
you your sharp-edged axes?>Pioneers! O pioneers!>For we cannot tarry here,We 
must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of 
danger,We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us 
depend,>Pioneers! O pioneers!O you youths, Western youths,So impatient, full of 
action, full of manly pride and friendship,Plain I see you 
Western youths, see you tramping with the fore- most Pioneers! 
O pioneers!Have the elder races halted?Do they droop and end 
their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas? We take 
up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,Pioneers! 
O pioneers!All the past we leave behind,We debouch upon a 
newer mightier world, varied world,Fresh and strong the world we 
seize, world of labor and the march,Pioneers! O pioneers!We detachments 
steady throwing,Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains
