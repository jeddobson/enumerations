urged by these songs,Sailing henceforth to every land, to every 
sea,)We willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers 
of all.We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing 
on, And have said, Why should not a man or 
woman do as much as the seasons, and effuse as 
much? We dwell a while in every city and town,We 
pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the 
Mississippi, and the Southern States, We confer on equal terms 
with each of the States,We make trial of ourselves and 
invite men and women to hear,We say to ourselves, Remember, 
fear not, be candid, promulge the body and the soul, 
Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, 
mag- netic, And what you effuse may then return as 
the seasons return,And may be just as much as the 
seasons. TO A CERTAIN CANTATRICE.HERE, take this gift,I was reserving 
it for some hero, speaker, or general,One who should serve 
the good old cause, the great idea, the prog- ress 
and freedom of the race, Some brave confronter of despots, 
some daring rebel;But I see that what I was reserving 
belongs to you just as much as to any. ME 
IMPERTURBE.ME imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,Master of all or 
mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things, 
Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,Finding my occupation, 
poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less im- portant than I thought, 
Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or 
the Tennes- see, or far north or inland, A river 
man, or a man of the woods or of any 
farm-life of these States or of the coast, or the 
lakes or Kanada, Me wherever my life is lived, O 
to be self-balanced for contingen- cies, To confront night, storms,
