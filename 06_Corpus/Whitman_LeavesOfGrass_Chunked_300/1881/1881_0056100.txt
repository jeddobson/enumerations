that on the deck,You've fallen cold and dead.My Captain does 
not answer, his lips are pale and still,My father does 
not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,The 
ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and 
done,From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object 
won;Exult O shores, and ring O bells!But I with mournful 
tread,Walk the deck my Captain lies,Fallen cold and dead. HUSH'D 
BE THE CAMPS TO-DAY.( May 4, 1865. )HUSH'D be the 
camps to-day,And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,And each 
with musing soul retire to celebrate,Our dear commander's death.No more 
for him life's stormy conflicts,Nor victory, nor defeat—no more time's 
dark events,Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.But sing poet 
in our name,Sing of the love we bore him—because you, 
dweller in camps, know it truly. As they invault the 
coffin there,Sing—as they close the doors of earth upon him—one 
verse,For the heavy hearts of soldiers. THIS DUST WAS ONCE 
THE MAN.THIS dust was once the man,Gentle, plain, just and 
resolute, under whose cautious hand,Against the foulest crime in history 
known in any land or age,Was saved the Union of 
these States. 264 BY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE.1BY blue Ontario's shore,As 
I mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, 
and the dead that return no more, A Phantom gigantic 
superb, with stern visage accosted me, Chant me the poem, 
it said, that comes from the soul of America, chant 
me the carol of victory, And strike up the marches 
of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,And sing me before you 
go the song of the throes of Democracy.(Democracy, the destin'd 
conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere, And death and infidelity at 
every step.)2A Nation announcing itself,I myself make the only growth 
by which I can be appreciated,I reject none, accept all,
