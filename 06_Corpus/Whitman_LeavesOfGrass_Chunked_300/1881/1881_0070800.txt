is the present after all but a growth out of 
the past?(As a projectile form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, 
still keeps on, So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by

the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,The gigantic dredging machines.In one 
again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)I 
see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every 
barrier, I see continual trains of cars winding along the
