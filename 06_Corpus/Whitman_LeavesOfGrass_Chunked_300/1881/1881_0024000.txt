find myself indecent, while birds and animals never once skulk 
or find themselves indecent, The great chastity of paternity, to 
match the great chastity of maternity, The oath of procreation 
I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh daughters, The greed 
that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till 
I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place 
when I am through, The wholesome relief, repose, content,And this 
bunch pluck'd at random from myself,It has done its workâ€”I 
toss it carelessly to fall where it may. ONE HOUR 
TO MADNESS AND JOY.ONE hour to madness and joy! O 
furious! O confine me not!(What is this that frees me 
so in storms?What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging 
winds mean?)O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any 
other man!O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath them to 
you my children, I tell them to you, for reasons, 
O bridegroom and bride.)O to be yielded to you whoever 
you are, and you to be yielded to me in 
defiance of the world! O to return to Paradise! O 
bashful and feminine!O to draw you to me, to plant 
on you for the first time the lips of a 
determin'd man. O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep 
and dark pool, all untied and illumin'd! O to speed 
where there is space enough and air enough at last!To 
be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions, I from mine 
and you from yours! To find a new unthought-of nonchalance 
with the best of Nature!To have the gag remov'd from 
one's mouth!To have the feeling to-day or any day I 
am sufficient as I am.O something unprov'd! something in a 
trance!To escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!To drive free! 
to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!To court destruction
