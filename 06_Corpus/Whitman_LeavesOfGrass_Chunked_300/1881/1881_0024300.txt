with taunts, with invitations!To ascend, to leap to the heavens 
of the love indicated to me!To rise thither with my 
inebriate soul!To be lost if it must be so!To feed 
the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and

I salute the air, the ocean and the land, Every 
day at sundown for your dear sake my love. AGES

Nature escapes,We are Nature, long have we been absent, but 
now we return,We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,We are 
bedded in the ground, we are rocks,We are oaks, we
