goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling 
of loose change, The floor-men are laying the floor, the 
tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for 
mortar, In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward 
the laborers;Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd, 
it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon 
and small arms!) Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, 
the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground; 
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by 
the hole in the frozen surface, The stumps stand thick 
round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe, 
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees, 
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or 
through those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of 
the Arkansas, Torches shine in the dark that hangs on 
the Chattahooche or Altamahaw, Patriarchs sit at supper with sons 
and grandsons and great-grand- sons around them, In walls of 
adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their 
day's sport, The city sleeps and the country sleeps,The living 
sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,The 
old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband 
sleeps by his wife; And these tend inward to me, 
and I tend outward to them,And such as it is 
to be of these more or less I am,And of 
these one and all I weave the song of myself.16I 
am of old and young, of the foolish as much 
as the wise,Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,Maternal as 
well as paternal, a child as well as a man,Stuff'd 
with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the 
stuff that is fine, One of the Nation of many
