of itself, And the dark hush promulges as much as 
any.I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled 
systems,And all I see multiplied as high as I can 
cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems. Wider 
and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,Outward and outward and 
forever outward.My sun has his sun and round him obediently

no philosophy,I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,But 
each man and each woman of you I lead upon 
a knoll,My left hand hooking you round the waist,My right
