dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,Concluded, dropt in the 
night, and was gone.Sing on there in the swamp,O singer 
bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your 
call,I hear, I come presently, I understand you,But a moment 
I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,The star 
my departing comrade holds and detains me.O how shall I 
warble myself for the dead one there I loved?And how 
shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul 
that has gone? And what shall my perfume be for

floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking 
sun, burning, expanding the air, With the fresh sweet herbage 
under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees 
prolific, In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of 
the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, With ranging 
hills on the banks, with many a line against the 
sky, and shadows, And the city at hand with dwellings 
so dense, and stacks of chim- neys, And all the 
scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward 
returning. Lo, body and soulâ€”this land,My own Manhattan with spires, 
and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, The 
varied and ample land, the South and the North in
