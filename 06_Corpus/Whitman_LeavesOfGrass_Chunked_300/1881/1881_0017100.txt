the sobbing liquid of life,Ever the bandage under the chin, 
ever the trestles of death.Here and there with dimes on 
the eyes walking,To feed the greed of the belly the 
brains liberally spooning,Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the 
feast never once going.Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the 
chaff for pay- ment receiving, A few idly owning, and 
they the wheat continually claiming.This is the city and I 
am one of the citizens,Whatever interests the rest interests me, 
politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools, The mayor and councils, banks, 
tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate. 
The little plentiful manikins skipping around incollars and tail'd coats, 
I am aware who they are, (they are positively not 
worms or fleas,)I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest 
and shallowest is deathless with me, What I do and 
say the same waits for them,Every thought that flounders in 
me the same flounders in them.I know perfectly well my 
own egotism,Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any 
less,And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.Not 
words of routine this song of mine,But abruptly to question, 
to leap beyond yet nearer bring;This printed and bound book—but 
the printer and the printing- office boy? The well-taken photographs—but 
your wife or friend close and solid in your arms? 
The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in 
her turrets— but the pluck of the captain and engineers? 
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the 
host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes? 
The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across 
the way?The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?Sermons, creeds, 
theology—but the fathomless human brain,And what is reason? and what 
is love? and what is life?43I do not despise you
