Platte carrying freight and passengers, I hear the locomotives rushing 
and roaring, and the shrill steam- whistle, I hear the 
echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world, I 
cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque 
shapes, the buttes, I see the plentiful larkspur and wild 
onions, the barren, colorless, sage-deserts, I see in glimpses afar

and nations born, thou born America,For purpose vast, man's long 
probation fill'd,Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.5O vast
