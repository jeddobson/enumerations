many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a religion, I descend 
into the arena, (It may be I am destin'd to 
utter the loudest cries there, the win ner's pealing shouts, 
Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar

the whole coin- cide, It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous 
hands sweeps and provides for all. 10Know you, solely to 
drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion, 
The following chants each for its kind I sing.My comrade!For
