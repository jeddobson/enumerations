Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with 
braced body, My left foot is on the gunwale, my 
right arm throws far out the coils of slender rope, 
In sight around me the quick veering and darting of 
fifty skiffs, my companions. O boating on the rivers,The voyage 
down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers, The 
ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft and the

from the mast-head, There—she blows! Again I spring up the 
rigging to look with the rest—we descend, wild with excitement, 
I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our 
prey where he lies,We approach stealthy and silent, I see
