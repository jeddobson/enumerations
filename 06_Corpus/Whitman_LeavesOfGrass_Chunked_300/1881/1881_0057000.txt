soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love, 
Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,Making its 
cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,Making its rivers, 
lakes, bays, embouchure in him,Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing 
chutes, Columbia, Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him, If 
the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he

wild animals, hunt- ers, trappers, Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, 
temperature, the gestation of new States, Congress convening every Twelfth-month, 
the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts, Surrounding 
the noble character of mechanics and farmers, espe- cially the 
young men, Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait 
they have of persons who never knew how it felt 
to stand in the presence of superiors, The freshness and 
candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their
