they have for each other,And they are to branch boundlessly 
out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, And until 
one and all shall delight us, and we them.31I believe 
a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work 
of the stars,And the pismire is equally perfect, and a 
grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And 
the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,And the running 
blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,And the narrowest hinge 
in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,And the cow 
crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,And a mouse is 
miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.I find I incorporate 
gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, And am 
stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,And have distanced what 
is behind me for good reasons,But call any thing back 
again when I desire it.In vain the speeding or shyness,In 
vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my 
approach,In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,In 
vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,In vain 
the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying 
low, In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,In 
vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,In vain 
the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,In 
vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,I follow 
quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of 
the cliff.32I think I could turn and live with animals, 
they are so placid and self-contain'd, I stand and look 
at them long and long.They do not sweat and whine 
about their condition,They do not lie awake in the dark 
and weep for their sins,They do not make me sick 
discussing their duty to God,Not one is dissatisfied, not one
