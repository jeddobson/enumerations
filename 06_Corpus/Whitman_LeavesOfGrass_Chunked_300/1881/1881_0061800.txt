whole- some odor falling off her person and clothes as 
she walks by, The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, 
unjust,The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the 
crafty lure,The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, 
the yearning and swelling heart, Affection that will not be 
gainsay'd, the sense of what is real, the thought if 
after all it should prove unreal, The doubts of day-time 
and the doubts of night-time, the curious whether and how, 
Whether that which appears so is so, or is it 
all flashes and specks?Men and women crowding fast in the 
streets, if they are not flashes and specks what are 
they? The streets themselves and the fa√ßades of houses, and 
goods in the windows, Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves, the 
huge crossing at the ferries, The village on the highland 
seen from afar at sunset, the river between, Shadows, aureola 
and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of 
white or brown two miles off, The schooner near by 
sleepily dropping down the tide, the little boat slack-tow'd astern, 
The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,The strata of color'd 
clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away solitary by itself, 
the spread of purity it lies motionless in, The horizon's 
edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and 
shore mud, These became part of that child who went 
forth every day, and who now goes, and will always 
go forth every day. OLD IRELAND.FAR hence amid an isle 
of wondrous beauty,Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,Once 
a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,Her 
old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,At her feet 
fallen an unused royal harp,Long silent, she too long silent, 
mourning her shrouded hope and heir, Of all the earth
