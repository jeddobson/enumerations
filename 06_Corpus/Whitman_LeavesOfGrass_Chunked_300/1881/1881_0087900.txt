children, bequeaths stocks, goods, funds for a school or hospital, 
Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens, souvenirs of 
gems and gold. But I, my life surveying, closing,With nothing 
to show to devise from its idle years,Nor houses nor 
lands, nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends,Yet 
certain remembrances of the war for you, and after you,And 
little souvenirs of camps and soldiers, with my love,I bind 
together and bequeath in this bundle of songs. PENSIVE ON 
HER DEAD GAZING.PENSIVE on her dead gazing I heard the 
Mother of All,Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms 
covering the battle- fields gazing, (As the last gun ceased, 
but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd,) As she call'd 
to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd,Absorb them 
well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose 
not my sons, lose not an atom, And you streams 
absorb them well, taking their dear blood,And you local spots, 
and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable, And all 
you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers' 
depths,And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear 
children's blood trickling redden'd, And you trees down in your 
roots to bequeath to all future trees,My dead absorb or 
South or Northâ€”my young men's bodies absorb, and their precious 
precious blood, Which holding in trust for me faithfully back 
again give me many a year hence, In unseen essence 
and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence,In blowing airs 
from the fields back again give me my darlings, give 
my immortal heroes, Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me 
their breath, let not an atom be lost, O years 
and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an 
aroma sweet!Exhale them perennial sweet death, years, centuries hence. CAMPS
