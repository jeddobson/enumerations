see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh 
festivals,I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,I hear 
the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle ages.Now the great 
organ sounds,Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the 
earth,On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,All shapes of 
beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,Green blades of

loving voices,Last miracle of all, O dearest mother's, sister's, voices;)The 
rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-leav'd corn,The 
measur'd sea-surf beating on the sand,The twittering bird, the hawk's 
sharp scream,The wild-fowl's notes at night as flying low migrating 
north or south, The psalm in the country church or
