full of grace, force, fascination,Do you know that Old Age 
may come after you with equal grace, force, fascination? Day 
full-blown and splendidâ€”day of the immense sun, action, ambition, laughter, 
The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep 
and restoring darkness. 181 BIRDS OF PASSAGE. SONG OF THE 
UNIVERSAL.1COME said the Muse,Sing me a song no poet yet 
has chanted,Sing me the universal.In this broad earth of ours,Amid 
the measureless grossness and the slag,Enclosed and safe within its 
central heart,Nestles the seed perfection.By every life a share or 
more or less,None born but it is born, conceal'd or

deafening orgies,Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,From 
some far shore the final chorus sounding.O the blest eyes, 
the happy hearts,That see, that know the guiding thread so
