hills and hollows, and the silver moun- tains of New 
Mexico—always soft-breath'd Cuba, Always the vast slope drain'd by the 
Southern sea, inseparable with the slopes drain'd by the Eastern 
and Western seas, The area the eighty-third year of these 
States, the three and a half millions of square miles, 
The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the 
main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation, The seven 
millions of distinct families and the same number of dwellings—always 
these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches, Always the 
free range and diversity—always the continent of Democracy; Always the 
prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada, the snows; Always 
these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt 
stringing the huge oval lakes; Always the West with strong 
native persons, the increasing density there, the habitans, friendly, threatening, 
ironical, scorning invaders; All sights, South, North, East—all deeds, promiscuously 
done at all times, All characters, movements, growths, a few 
noticed, myriads unno- ticed, Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these 
things gathering,On interior rivers by night in the glare of 
pine knots, steamboats wooding up, Sunlight by day on the 
valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys of the 
Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke and 
Delaware, In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the 
Adirondacks the hills, or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink, 
In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, 
sitting on the water rocking silently, In farmers' barns oxen 
in the stable, their harvest labor done, they rest standing, 
they are too tired, Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus 
lying drowsily while her cubs play around, The hawk sailing 
where men have not yet sail'd, the farthest polar sea, 
ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes, White drift spooning ahead
