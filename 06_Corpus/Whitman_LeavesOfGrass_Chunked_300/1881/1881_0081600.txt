face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,An unceasing death-bell 
tolls there.Features of my equals would you trick me with 
your creas'd and cadaverous march? Well, you cannot trick me.I 
see your rounded never-erased flow,I see 'neath the rims of 
your haggard and mean disguises.Splay and twist as you like, 
poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats, You'll 
be unmuzzled, you certainly will.I saw the face of the 
most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had at the asylum, 
And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,I 
knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,The 
same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement,And 
I shall look again in a score or two of 
ages,And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm'd, 
every inch as good as myself. The Lord advances, and 
yet advances,Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd hand 
bringing up the laggards. Out of this face emerge banners 
and horses—O superb! I see what is coming, I see 
the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners clearing the way,I 
hear victorious drums.This face is a life-boat,This is the face 
commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest, 
This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,This face of 
a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.These 
faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,They show their descent from 
the Master himself.Off the word I have spoken I except 
not one—red, white, black, are all deific, In each house 
is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years.Spots 
or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,Tall and 
sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,I read the 
promise and patiently wait.This is a full-grown lily's face,She speaks 
to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets, Come here
