at the back-top, The faces of hunters and fishers bulged 
at the brows, the shaved blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens, 
The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,The ugly face of 
some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or despised face, The 
sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother 
of many children, The face of an amour, the face 
of veneration,The face as of a dream, the face of

they show nothing but their whites, Its teeth grit, the 
palms of the hands are cut by the turn'd-in nails, 
The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while 
he speculates well. This face is bitten by vermin and 
worms,And this is some murderer's knife with a half-pull'd scabbard.This
