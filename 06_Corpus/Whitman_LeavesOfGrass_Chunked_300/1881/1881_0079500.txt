is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.) PENSIVE 
AND FALTERING.PENSIVE and faltering,The words the Dead I write,For living 
are the Dead,(Haply the only living, only real, And I 
the apparition, I the spectre.) 346 THOU MOTHER WITH THY 
EQUAL BROOD.1THOU Mother with thy equal brood,Thou varied chain of 
different States, yet one identity only,A special song before I 
go I'd sing o'er all the rest,For thee, the future.I'd 
sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,I'd fashion thy 
ensemble including body and soul,I'd show away ahead thy real 
Union, and how it may be accom- plish'd. The paths 
to the house I seek to make,But leave to those 
to come the house itself.Belief I sing, and preparation;As Life 
and Nature are not great with reference to the present 
only, But greater still from what is yet to come,Out 
of that formula for thee I sing.2As a strong bird 
on pinions free,Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,Such be the 
thought I'd think of thee America,Such be the recitative I'd 
bring for thee.The conceits of the poets of other lands 
I'd bring thee not,Nor the compliments that have served their 
turn so long,Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of 
foreign court or indoor library; But an odor I'd bring 
as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of 
an Illinois prairie, With open airs of Virginia or Georgia 
or Tennessee, or from Texas uplands, or Florida's glades, Or 
the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of 
Huron, With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,And murmuring under, 
pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea- sound, That endlessly 
sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.And for 
thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,Preludes of intellect tallying 
these and thee, mind-formulas fitted for thee, real and sane
