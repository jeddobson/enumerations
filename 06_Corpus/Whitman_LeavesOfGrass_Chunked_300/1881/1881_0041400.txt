day or night? Joys of the thought of Death, the 
great spheres Time and Space?Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's 
ideals, the divine wife, the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade? Joys 
all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.O 
while I live to be the ruler of life, not 
a slave,To meet life as a powerful conqueror,No fumes, no 
ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,To these proud laws 
of the air, the water and the ground, proving my 
interior soul impregnable, And nothing exterior shall ever take command 
of me.For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating—the joy 
of death!The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a 
few moments, for reasons, Myself discharging my excrementitious body to 
be burn'd, or render'd to powder, or buried, My real 
body doubtless left to me for other spheres,My voided body 
nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, further offices, 
eternal uses of the earth. O to attract by more 
than attraction!How it is I know not—yet behold! the something 
which obeys none of the rest, It is offensive, never 
defensive—yet how magnetic it draws.O to struggle against great odds, 
to meet enemies undaunted!To be entirely alone with them, to 
find how much one can stand!To look strife, torture, prison, 
popular odium, face to face!To mount the scaffold, to advance 
to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! To be 
indeed a God!O to sail to sea in a ship!To 
leave this steady unendurable land,To leave the tiresome sameness of 
the streets, the sidewalks and the houses, To leave you 
O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,To sail 
and sail and sail!O to have life henceforth a poem 
of new joys!To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, 
roll on, float on!To be a sailor of the world
