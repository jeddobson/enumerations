her heart most full of sorrow because most full of 
love. Yet a word ancient mother,You need crouch there no 
longer on the cold ground with fore- head between your 
knees, O you need not sit there veil'd in your 
old white hair so dishevel'd,For know you the one you 
mourn is not in that grave,It was an illusion, the 
son you love was not really dead,The Lord is not 
dead, he is risen again young and strong in another 
country, Even while you wept there by your fallen harp 
by the grave,What you wept for was translated, pass'd from 
the grave,The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,And now 
with rosy and new blood,Moves to-day in a new country. 
THE CITY DEAD-HOUSE.BY the city dead-house by the gate,As idly 
sauntering wending my way from the clangor,I curious pause, for 
lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought, Her 
corpse they deposit unclaim'd, it lies on the damp brick 
pavement, The divine woman, her body, I see the body, 
I look on it alone,That house once full of passion 
and beauty, all else I notice not,Nor stillness so cold, 
nor running water from faucet, nor odors morbific impress me, 
But the house alone—that wondrous house—that delicate fair house—that ruin! 
That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings 
ever built! Or white-domed capitol with majestic figure surmounted, or 
all the old high-spired cathedrals, That little house alone more 
than them all—poor, desperate house! Fair, fearful wreck—tenement of a 
soul—itself a soul,Unclaim'd, avoided house—take one breath from my tremulous 
lips, Take one tear dropt aside as I go for 
thought of you,Dead house of love—house of madness and sin, 
crumbled, crush'd, House of life, erewhile talking and laughing—but ah, 
poor house, dead even then, Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd
