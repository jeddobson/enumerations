young men, I dance with the dancers and drink with 
the drinkers,The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick 
out some low person for my dearest friend, He shall

my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one 
of the wrists around my head, Heard the pulse of 
you when all was still ringing little bells last night 
under my ear. FACING WEST FROM CALIFORNIA'S SHORES.FACING west from
