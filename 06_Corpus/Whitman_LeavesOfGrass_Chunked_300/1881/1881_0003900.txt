yet been heard upon earth. I will make the songs 
of passion to give them their way,And your songs outlaw'd 
offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes, and carry 
you with me the same as any. I will make 
the true poem of riches,To earn for the body and 
the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and is not 
dropt by death; I will effuse egotism and show it 
underlying all, and I will be the bard of personality, 
And I will show of male and female that either 
is but the equal of the other, And sexual organs 
and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am 
determin'd to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove 
you illustrious, And I will show that there is no 
imperfection in the present, and can be none in the 
future, And I will show that whatever happens to anybody 
it may be turn'd to beautiful results, And I will 
show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death, And 
I will thread a thread through my poems that time 
and events are compact, And that all the things of 
the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any. 
I will not make poems with reference to parts,But I 
will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,And I 
will not sing with reference to a day, but with 
reference to all days, And I will not make a 
poem nor the least part of a poem but has 
reference to the soul, Because having look'd at the objects 
of the universe, I find there is no one nor 
any particle of one but has reference to the soul. 
13Was somebody asking to see the soul?See, your own shape 
and countenance, persons, substances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers,
