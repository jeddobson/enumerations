prayers, if they do not return in mock- eries, what 
is their return?) The mockeries are not you,Underneath them and 
within them I see you lurk,I pursue you where none 
else has pursued you,Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the 
night, the accustom'd routine, if these conceal you from others 
or from yourself, they do not conceal you from me, 
The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if 
these balk others they do not balk me, The pert

songs of the glory of you. Whoever you are! claim 
your own at any hazard!These shows of the East and 
West are tame compared to you,These immense meadows, these interminable 
rivers, you are immense and interminable as they, These furies, 
elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of appar- ent dissolution, 
you are he or she who is master or mistress 
over them, Master or mistress in your own right over 
Nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution. The hopples fall from your 
ankles, you find an unfailing sufficiency,Old or young, male or 
female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever you are 
promulges itself, Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are 
provided, nothing is scanted, Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui,
