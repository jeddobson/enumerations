the world, politics, produce,The announcements of recognized things, science,The approved

we barely arrive at this beginning of us?—and yet it 
is enough, O soul; O soul, we have positively appear'd—that 
is enough. YEARS OF THE MODERN.YEARS of the modern! years 
of the unperform'd!Your horizon rises, I see it parting away 
for more august dramas,I see not America only, not only 
Liberty's nation but other nations preparing, I see tremendous entrances
