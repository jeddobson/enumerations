bound for all ports,A ship itself, (see indeed these sails 
I spread to the sun and air,)A swift and swelling 
ship full of rich words, full of joys. 157 SONG 
OF THE EXPOSITION.1(AH little recks the laborer,How near his work 
is holding him to God,The loving Laborer through space and 
time.)After all not to create only, or found only,But to 
bring perhaps from afar what is already founded,To give it 
our own identity, average, limitless, free,To fill the gross the 
torpid bulk with vital religious fire,Not to repel or destroy 
so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,To obey as well as 
command, to follow more than to lead,These also are the 
lessons of our New World;While how little the New after 
all, how much the Old, Old World!Long and long hasthe 
grass been growing,Long and long has the rain been falling,Long 
has the globe been rolling round.2Come Muse migrate from Greece 
and Ionia,Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,That matter of 
Troy and Achilles' wrath, and Aeneas', Odysseus' wanderings, Placard "Removed" 
and "To Let" on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus, 
Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on Jaffa's gate 
and on Mount Moriah, The same on the walls of 
your German, French and Spanish castles, and Italian collections, For 
know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried domain 
awaits, demands you. 3Responsive to our summons,Or rather to her 
long-nurs'd inclination,Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,She comes! I hear 
the rustling of her gown,I scent the odor of her 
breath's delicious fragrance,I mark her step divine, her curious eyes 
a-turning, rolling,Upon this very scene.The dame of dames! can I 
believe then,Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of them 
retain her? Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad 
memories, poems, old associations, magnetize and hold on to her?
