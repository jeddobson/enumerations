afterward,But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, 
and cannot fail.Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops 
is consider'd, not a single one can it fail. It 
cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,Nor

account with lamentation,(What have I to do with lamentation?)I am 
an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of
