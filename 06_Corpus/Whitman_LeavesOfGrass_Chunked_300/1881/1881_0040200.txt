brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast, 
To continue and be employ'd there all my life,The briny 
and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at 
low water, The work of fishermen, the work of the 
eel-fisher and clam-fisher;I come with my clam-rake and spade, I 
come with my eel-spear,Is the tide out? I join the 
group of clam-diggers on the flats,I laugh and work with 
them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome young

to work with me, and by night to sleep with 
me.Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to 
lift the lobster-pots where they are sunk with heavy stones, 
(I know the buoys,) O the sweetness of the Fifth-month 
morning upon the water as I row just before sunrise 
toward the buoys, I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, 
the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as 
I take them out, I insert wooden pegs in the 
joints of their pincers, I go to all the places 
one after another, and then row back to the shore, 
There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters 
shall be boil'd till their color becomes scarlet. Another time 
mackerel-taking,Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem 
to fill the water for miles; Another time fishing for 
rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the brown-faced crew;
