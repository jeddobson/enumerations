earth neither lags nor hastens,It has all attributes, growths, effects, 
latent in itself from the jump,It is not half beautiful 
only, defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections 
show. The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,The 
truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so 
conceal'd either, They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,They are 
imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,Conveying a sentiment and

hear me not of what avail am I to you?To 
bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?(Accouche! 
accouchez!Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?Will you

has no arrangements,Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,Makes no 
discriminations, has no conceivable failures,Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none

lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young people, 
accents of bargainers, Underneath these possessing words that never fail.To 
her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother 
never fail, The true words do not fail, for motion 
does not fail and reflection does not fail, Also the 
day and night do not fail, and the voyage we 
pursue does not fail. Of the interminable sisters,Of the ceaseless 
cotillons of sisters,Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder 
and younger sisters, The beautiful sister we know dances on 
with the rest.With her ample back towards every beholder,With the 
fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,Sits she 
whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,Holding up
