am good-fortune,Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need 
nothing,Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,Strong and content I 
travel the open road.The earth, that is sufficient,I do not 
want the constellations any nearer,I know they are very well 
where they are,I know they suffice for those who belong 
to them.(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,I carry 
them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever 
I go,I swear it is impossible for me to get 
rid of them,I am fill'd with them, and I will 
fill them in return.)2You road I enter upon and look 
around, I believe you are not all that is here, 
I believe that much unseen is also here.Here the profound 
lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,The black with his 
woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the illiterate person, are 
not denied; The birth, the hasting after the physician, the 
beggar's tramp, the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, 
The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the 
eloping couple, The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of 
furniture into the town, the return back from the town, 
They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can 
be interdicted,None but are accepted, none but shall be dear 
to me.3You air that serves me with breath to speak!You 
objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them 
shape! You light that wraps me and all things in 
delicate equable showers!You paths worn in the irregular hollows by 
the roadsides!I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you 
are so dear to me. You flagg'd walks of the 
cities! you strong curbs at the edges!You ferries! you planks 
and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! 
You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd fa√ßades! you roofs!You porches
