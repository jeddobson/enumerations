where the ship in the tempest dashes,On solid land what 
is done in cities as the bells strike midnight together, 
In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl 
of the wolf, the scream of the panther, and the 
hoarse bellow of the elk, In winter beneath the hard

Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge, by 
the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking, In Virginia, the planter's 
son returning after a long absence, joy- fully welcom'd and
