in her hand what has the character of a mirror, 
while her eyes glance back from it, Glance as she 
sits, inviting none, denying none,Holding a mirror day and night 
tirelessly before her own face.Seen at hand or seen at 
a distance,Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,Duly approach 
and pass with their companions or a companion,Looking from no 
countenances of their own, but from the counte- nances of

glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,Of all able and ready at 
any time to give strict account,The divine ship sails the 
divine sea.2Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for 
you,The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.Whoever you 
are! you are he or she for whom the earth 
is solid and liquid, You are he or she for 
whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,For none 
more than you are the present and the past,For none 
more than you is immortality.Each man to himself and each 
woman to herself, is the word of the past and
