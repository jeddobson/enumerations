the night, Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, 
and yet again bursting with joy, Covering the earth and 
filling the spread of the heaven,As that powerful psalm in 
the night I heard from recesses,Passing, I leave thee lilac 
with heart-shaped leaves,I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, 
returning with spring. I cease from my song for thee,From 
my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, 
communing with thee, O comrade lustrous with silver face in 
the night.Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of 
the night,The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,And 
the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,With the 
lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, 
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of 
the bird,Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their 
memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so 
well, For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days 
and lands—and this for his dear sake, Lilac and star 
and bird twined with the chant of my soul,There in 
the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim. O 
CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is 
done,The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought 
is won,The port is near, the bells I hear, the 
people all exulting,While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel 
grim and daring;But O heart! heart! heart!O the bleeding drops 
of red,Where on the deck my Captain lies,Fallen cold and 
dead.O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;Rise 
up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,For 
you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, For 
you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;Here 
Captain! dear father!This arm beneath your head!It is some dream
