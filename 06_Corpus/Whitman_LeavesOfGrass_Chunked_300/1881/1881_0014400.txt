the living cities of the globe. I am a free 
companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,I turn the bridegroom out 
of bed and stay with the bride myself,I tighten her 
all night to my thighs and lips.My voice is the 
wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,They

I feel or am.I am the hounded slave, I wince 
at the bite of the dogs,Hell and despair are upon 
me, crack and again crack the marks- men, I clutch 
the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with
