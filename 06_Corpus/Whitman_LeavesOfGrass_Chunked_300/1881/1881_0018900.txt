laughingly dash with your hair. 47I am the teacher of 
athletes,He that by me spreads a wider breast than my 
own proves the width of my own, He most honors 
my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher. 
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not 
through derived power, but in his own right, Wicked rather 
than virtuous out of conformity or fear,Fond of his sweetheart, 
relishing well his steak,Unrequited love or a slight cutting him 
worse than sharp steel cuts, First-rate to ride, to fight, 
to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff, to 
sing a song or play on the banjo, Preferring scars 
and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all 
latherers, And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of 
the sun.I teach straying from me, yet who can stray 
from me?I follow you whoever you are from the present 
hour,My words itch at your ears till you understand them.I 
do not say these things for a dollar or to 
fill up the time while I wait for a boat, 
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I 
act as the tongue of you, Tied in your mouth, 
in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)I swear I will 
never again mention love or death inside a house,And I 
swear I will never translate myself at all, only to 
him or her who privately stays with me in the 
open air. If you would understand me go to the 
heights or water-shore,The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a 
drop or motion of waves a key, The maul, the 
oar, the hand-saw, second my words.No shutter'd room or school 
can commune with me,But roughs and little children better than 
they.The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me
