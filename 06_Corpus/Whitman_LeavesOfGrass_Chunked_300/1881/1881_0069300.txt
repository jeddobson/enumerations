tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;Here, do 
you know this? this is cicerone himself,With finger rais'd he 
points to the prodigal pictures. THE PRAIRIE STATES.A NEWER garden 
of creation, no primal solitude,Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities 
and farms,With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,By all 
the world contributed—freedom's and law's and thrift's society, The crown

women, the wounded groaning in agony,The hiss and crackle of 
flames, the blacken'd ruins, the embers of cities, The dirge
