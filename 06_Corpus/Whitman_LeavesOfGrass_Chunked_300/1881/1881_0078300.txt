through the air on purpose, and that I shall one 
day be eligible to do as much as they, and 
more than they, I do not doubt that temporary affairs 
keep on and on millions of years, I do not 
doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have their exteriors, 
and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and the hearing 
another hearing, and the voice another voice, I do not 
doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are provided 
for, and that the deaths of young women and the 
deaths of little children are provided for, (Did you think 
Life was so well provided for, and Death, the pur-

do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what 
the horrors of them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, 
father, lover, has gone down, are provided for, to the 
minutest points, I do not doubt that whatever can possibly 
happen anywhere at any time, is provided for in the 
inherences of things, I do not think Life provides for 
all and for Time and Space, but I believe Heavenly 
Death provides for all. QUICKSAND YEARS.QUICKSAND years that whirl me

substances mock and elude me, Only the theme I sing, 
the great and strong-possess'd soul, eludes not, One's-self must never 
give way—that is the final substance— that out of all 
is sure, Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at 
last finally remains?When shows break up what but One's-Self is 
sure? THAT MUSIC ALWAYS ROUND ME.THAT music always round me, 
unceasing, unbeginning, yet long untaught I did not hear, But 
now the chorus I hear and am elated,A tenor, strong, 
ascending with power and health, with glad notes of daybreak
