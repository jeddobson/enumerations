to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the 
earth,I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my 
own life,Or the lives of the earth arrived as far 
as mine, or waiting to arrive.O I see now that 
life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,I 
see that I am to wait for what will be

great feast, suddenly while the music is playing, To my

the sower sowing in the fields, or the harvester harvesting,I 
saw there too, O life and death, your analogies;(Life, life
