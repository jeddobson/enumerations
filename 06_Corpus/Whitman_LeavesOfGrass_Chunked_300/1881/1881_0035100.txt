men,They go! they go! I know that they go, but 
I know not where they go, But I know that 
they go toward the best—toward something great. Whoever you are, 
come forth! or man or woman come forth!You must not 
stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you 
built it, or though it has been built for you. 
Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!It 
is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.Behold 
through you as bad as the rest,Through the laughter, dancing, 
dining, supping, of people,Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of 
those wash'd and trimm'd faces, Behold a secret silent loathing 
and despair.No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear 
the confession,Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and 
hiding it goes,Formless and wordless through the streets of the 
cities, polite and bland in the parlors, In the cars 
of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,Home to the 
houses of men and women, at the table, in the 
bed- room, everywhere, Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death 
under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, Under the broadcloth 
and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, Keeping fair 
with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,Speaking of 
any thing else but never of itself.14Allons! through struggles and 
wars!The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.Have the past 
struggles succeeded?What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?Now understand me 
well—it is provided in the essence of things that from 
any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth 
something to make a greater struggle necessary. My call is 
the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,He going with 
me must go well arm'd,He going with me goes often 
with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 15Allons! the road
