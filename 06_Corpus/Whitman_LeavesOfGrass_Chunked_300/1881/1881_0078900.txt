SHORTLY TO DIE.FROM all the rest I single out you, 
having a message for you,You are to die—let others tell 
you what they please, I cannot prevaricate, I am exact 
and merciless, but I love you—there is no escape for 
you. Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you 
just feel it,I do not argue, I bend my head

saw what the not-day exhibited, I was thinking this globe 
enough till there sprang out so noiseless around me myriads 
of other globes. Now while the great thoughts of space 
and eternity fill me I will measure myself by them, 
And now touch'd with the lives of other globes arrived 
as far along as those of the earth, Or waiting
