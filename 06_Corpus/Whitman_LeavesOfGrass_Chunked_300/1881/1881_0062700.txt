bloom in the dooryards, The summer growth is innocent and 
disdainful above all those strata of sour dead. What chemistry!That 
the winds are really not infectious,That this is no cheat, 
this transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous 
after me, That it is safe to allow it to 
lick my naked body all over with its tongues, That 
it will not endanger me with the fevers that have 
deposited themselves in it, That all is clean forever and 
forever,That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,That 
blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,That the fruits of the 
apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will 
none of them poison me, That when I recline on 
the grass I do not catch any disease,Though probably every 
spear of grass rises out of what was once a 
catching disease. Now I am terrified at the Earth, it 
is that calm and patient,It grows such sweet things out 
of such corruptions,It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, 
with such endless successions of diseas'd corpses, It distills such 
exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,It renews with such 
unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptu- ous crops, It gives 
such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from 
them at last. TO A FOIL'D EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONAIRE.COURAGE yet, my 
brother or my sister!Keep onâ€”Liberty is to be subserv'd whatever 
occurs;That is nothing that is quell'd by one or two 
failures, or any num- ber of failures, Or by the 
indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any unfaithfulness, 
Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, 
penal statutes.What we believe in waits latent forever through all 
the continents,Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and 
light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement, Waiting patiently,
