know not whether I sleep or wake;) The perform'd America 
and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me, The 
unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me. ASHES 
OF SOLDIERS.ASHES of soldiers South or North,As I muse retrospective 
murmuring a chant in thought,The war resumes, again to my 
sense your shapes,And again the advance of the armies.Noiseless as 
mists and vapors,From their graves in the trenches ascending,From cemeteries 
all through Virginia and Tennessee,From every point of the compass 
out of the countless graves,In wafted clouds, in myriads large, 
or squads of twos or threes or single ones they 
come, And silently gather round me.Now sound no note O 
trumpeters,Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited 
horses,With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, 
(ah my brave horsemen! My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, 
what joy and pride,With all the perils were yours.)Nor you 
drummers, neither at reveillé at dawn,Nor the long roll alarming 
the camp, nor even the muffled beat for a burial, 
Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike 
drums.But aside from these and the marts of wealth and 
the crowded promenade, Admitting around me comrades close unseen by 
the rest and voiceless, The slain elate and alive again, 
the dust and debris alive,I chant this chant of my 
silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers. Faces 
so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,Draw 
close, but speak not.Phantoms of countless lost,Invisible to the rest 
henceforth become my companions,Follow me ever—desert me not while I 
live.Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living—sweet are the 
musi- cal voices sounding, But sweet, ah sweet, are the 
dead with their silent eyes.Dearest comrades, all is over and 
long gone,But love is not over—and what love, O comrades!Perfume
