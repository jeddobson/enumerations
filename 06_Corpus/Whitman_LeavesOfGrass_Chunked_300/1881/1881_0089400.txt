enough.Enough O deed impromptu and secret,Enough O gliding presentâ€”enough O 
summ'd-up past.Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss,I give 
it especially to you, do not forget me,I feel like 
one who has done work for the day to retire 
awhile,I receive now again of my many translations, from my 
avataras as- cending, while others doubtless await me, An unknown 
sphere more real than I dream'd, more direct, darts awakening 
rays about me, So long! Remember my words, I may 
again return,I love you, I depart from materials,I am as 
one disembodied, triumphant, dead.
