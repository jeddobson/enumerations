every word he speaks draw blood, The years straying toward 
infidelity he withholds by his steady faith, He is no 
arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)He judges not 
as the judge judges but as the sun falling round

cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles—the hurtled balls scream, The battle-front 
forms amid the smoke—the volleys pour incessant from the line,

furious maddening yells, Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the 
ground,Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,Angry cloth 
I saw there leaping.)12Are you he who would assume a
