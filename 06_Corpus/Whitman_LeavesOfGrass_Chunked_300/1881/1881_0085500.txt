flag of man—O with sure and steady step, passing highest 
flags of kings, Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbol—run 
up above them all, Flag of stars! thick-sprinkled bunting! WHAT 
BEST I SEE IN THEE.To U. S. G. return'd from 
his World's Tour.WHAT best I see in thee,Is not that 
where thou mov'st down history's great highways,Ever undimm'd by time

arch forgot? But thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this 
scene,They have remember'd thee. AS I WALK THESE BROAD MAJESTIC 
DAYS.AS I walk these broad majestic days of peace,(For the 
war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific Ideal, 
Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won,Now thou stridest on, 
yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,Perhaps to engage in 
time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,Longer campaigns and crises, 
labors beyond all others,)Around me I hear that eclat of
