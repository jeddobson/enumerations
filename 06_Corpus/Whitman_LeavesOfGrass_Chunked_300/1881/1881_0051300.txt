world on my Western sea,I chant copious the islands beyond, 
thick as stars in the sky,I chant the new empire 
grander than any before, as in a vision it comes 
to me, I chant America the mistress, I chant a 
greater supremacy,I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in 
time on those groups of sea-islands, My sail-ships and steam-ships 
threading the archipelagoes,My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,Commerce 
opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races 
reborn, refresh'd, Lives, works resumed—the object I know not—but the 
old, the Asiatic renew'd as it must be, Commencing from 
this day surrounded by the world.3And you Libertad of the 
world!You shall sit in the middle well-pois'd thousands and thousands 
of years, As to-day from one side the nobles of 
Asia come to you,As to-morrow from the other side the 
queen of England sends her eldest son to you. The 
sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,The ring is circled, 
the journey is done,The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless 
the perfume pours copiously out of the whole box. Young 
Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,Be considerate with her 
now and ever hot Libertad, for you are all,Bend your 
proud neck to the long-off mother now sending mes- sages 
over the archipelagoes to you, Bend your proud neck low 
for once, young Libertad.Were the children straying westward so long? 
so wide the tramping?Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward 
from Paradise so long? Were the centuries steadily footing it 
that way, all the while unknown, for you, for reasons? 
They are justified, they are accomplish'd, they shall now be 
turn'd the other way also, to travel toward you thence, 
They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake 
Libertad. 209 BY THE ROADSIDE.A BOSTON BALLAD.(1854.)TO get betimes in
