and Western,The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia, Texas, 
and the rest, Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, 
corn, rice, hemp, hops,Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freight-train 
and the bulging storehouse, The grapes that ripen on thy 
vines, the apples in thy orchards,Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, 
potatoes, thy coal, thy gold and silver, The inexhaustible iron 
in thy mines.All thine O sacred Union!Ships, farms, shops, barns,

beauty, and that thou might'st dally as now secure up 
there, Many a good man have I seen go under.Now 
here and these and hence in peace, all thine O 
Flag!And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and 
thou for them!And here and hence O Union, all the
