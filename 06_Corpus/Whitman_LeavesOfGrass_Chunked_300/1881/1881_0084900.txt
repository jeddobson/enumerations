or what, yet weave, forever weave. SPAIN, 1873-74OUT of the 
murk of heaviest clouds,Out of the feudal wrecks and heap'd-up 
skeletons of kings,Out of that old entire European debris, the 
shatter'd mummeries,Ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests,Lo, Freedom's 
features fresh undimm'd look forth—the same immortal face looks forth;

forenoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!O 
deathless grass, of you! FROM FAR DAKOTA'S CAñONS. June 25, 
1876.FROM far Dakota's cañons,Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky 
Sioux, the lonesome stretch, the silence, Haply to-day a mournful 
wail, haply a trumpet-note for heroes.The battle-bulletin,The Indian ambuscade, the 
craft, the fatal environment,The cavalry companies fighting to the last 
in sternest heroism,In the midst of their little circle, with 
their slaughter'd horses for breastworks, The fall of Custer and 
all his officers and men.Continues yet the old, old legend 
of our race,The loftiest of life upheld by death,The ancient
