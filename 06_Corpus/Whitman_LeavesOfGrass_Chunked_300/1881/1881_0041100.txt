with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,Proved to 
me this day beyond cavil that it is not my 
material eyes which finally see, Nor my material body which 
finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, procreates. O the farmer's 
joys!Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's, Kan- sian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys! 
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly 
to work,To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,To 
plough land in the spring for maize,To train orchards, to 
graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.O to 
bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along 
shore,To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked 
along the shore. O to realize space!The plenteousness of all, 
that there are no bounds,To emerge and be of the 
sky, of the sun and moon and flying clouds, as 
one with them. O the joy of a manly self-hood!To 
be servile to none, to defer to none, not to 
any tyrant known or unknown, To walk with erect carriage, 
a step springy and elastic,To look with calm gaze or 
with a flashing eye,To speak with a full and sonorous 
voice out of a broad chest,To confront with your personality 
all the other personalities of the earth. Know'st thou the 
excellent joys of youth?Joys of the dear companions and of 
the merry word and laughing face? Joy of the glad 
light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?Joy of sweet music, 
joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?Joy of the 
plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?Yet O my soul supreme!Know'st 
thou the joys of pensive thought?Joys of the free and 
lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?Joys of the solitary walk, 
the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering and the struggle? 
The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings
