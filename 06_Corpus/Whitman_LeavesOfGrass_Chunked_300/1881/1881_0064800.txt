shame and dole!O fearful thought—a convict soul. WARBLE FOR LILAC-TIME.WARBLE 
me now for joy of lilac-time, (returning in reminiscence,)Sort me 
O tongue and lips for Nature's sake, souvenirs of earliest 
summer, Gather the welcome signs, (as children with pebbles or 
stringing shells,) Put in April and May, the hylas croaking 
in the ponds, the elastic air, Bees, butterflies, the sparrow 
with its simple notes,Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the 
high-hole flashing his golden wings, The tranquil sunny haze, the 
clinging smoke, the vapor,Shimmer of waters with fish in them, 
the cerulean above,All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks 
running,The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugar-making,The 
robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,With musical clear call at 
sunrise, and again at sunset,Or flitting among the trees of 
the apple-orchard, building the nest of his mate, The melted 
snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow- green 
sprouts, For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and 
what is this in it and from it? Thou, soul, 
unloosen'd—the restlessness after I know not what;Come, let us lag 
here no longer, let us be up and away!O if 
one could but fly like a bird!O to escape, to 
sail forth as in a ship!To glide with thee O 
soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the 
waters;Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, 
the morning drops of dew, The lilac-scent, the bushes with 
dark green heart-shaped leaves,Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called 
innocence,Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their 
atmo- sphere, To grace the bush I love—to sing with 
the birds,A warble for joy of lilac-time, returning in reminiscence.
