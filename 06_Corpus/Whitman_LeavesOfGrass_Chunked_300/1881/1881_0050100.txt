sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up 
my bay, Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up 
my bay, she was 600 feet long, Her moving swiftly 
surrounded by myriads of small craft I forget not to 
sing; Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the 
north flaring in heaven, Nor the strange huge meteor-procession dazzling 
and clear shoot- ing over our heads, (A moment, a 
moment long it sail'd its balls of unearthly light over 
our heads, Then departed, dropt in the night, and was 
gone;)Of such, and fitful as they, I sing—with gleams from 
them would I gleam and patch these chants, Your chants, 
O year all mottled with evil and good—year of forebodings! 
Year of comets and meteors transient and strange—lo! even here 
one equally transient and strange! As I flit through you 
hastily, soon to fall and be gone, what is this 
chant, What am I myself but one of your meteors? 
WITH ANTECEDENTS.WITH antecedents,With my fathers and mothers and the accumulations 
of past ages, With all which, had it not been, 
I would not now be here, as I am, With 
Egypt, India, Phenicia, Greece and Rome,With the Kelt, the Scandinavian, 
the Alb and the Saxon,With antique maritime ventures, laws, artisanship, 
wars and jour- neys, With the poet, the skald, the 
saga, the myth, and the oracle,With the sale of slaves, 
with enthusiasts, with the troubadour, the crusader, and the monk, 
With those old continents whence we have come to this 
new continent, With the fading kingdoms and kings over there,With 
the fading religions and priests,With the small shores we look 
back to from our own large and present shores, With 
countless years drawing themselves onward and arrived at these years, 
You and me arrived—America arrived and making this year,This year!
