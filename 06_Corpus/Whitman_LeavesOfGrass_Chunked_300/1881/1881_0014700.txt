the ooze of my skin, I fall on the weeds 
and stones,The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,Taunt my 
dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with 
whip-stocks. Agonies are one of my changes of garments,I do 
not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself 
become the wounded person, My hurts turn livid upon me 
as I lean on a cane and observe.I am the 
mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,Tumbling walls buried me in their

the whole,The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,The 
ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,Workmen searching after damages, 
making indispensable repairs,The fall of grenades through the rent roof, 
the fan-shaped explo sion, The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, 
wood, iron, high in the air.Again gurgles the mouth of 
my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand, He 
gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrench ments. 34Now 
I tell what I knew in Texas in my early
