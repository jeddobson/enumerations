Patapsco, You Hudson, you endless Mississippi—nor you alone,But to the 
high seas launch, my thought, his memory. OUT FROM BEHIND 
THIS MASK. ( To Confront a Portrait. ) OUT from 
behind this bending rough-cut mask,These lights and shades, this drama

practice? from physique? Do you move in these broad lands 
as broad as they?Come duly to the divine power to 
speak words?For only at last after many years, after chastity, 
friendship, procrea- tion, prudence, and nakedness, After treading ground and
