house—but dead, dead, dead. THIS COMPOST.SOMETHING startles me where I 
thought I was safest,I withdraw from the still woods I 
loved,I will not go now on the pastures to walk,I 
will not strip the clothes from my body to meet 
my lover the sea,I will not touch my flesh to 
the earth as to other flesh to renew me.O how 
can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?How 
can you be alive you growths of spring?How can you 
furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain? Are 
they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?Is not every 
continent work'd over and over with sour dead?Where have you 
disposed of their carcasses?Those drunkards and gluttons of so many 
generations?Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and 
meat?I do not see any of it upon you to-day, 
or perhaps I am deceiv'd,I will run a furrow with 
my plough, I will press my spade through the sod 
and turn it up underneath, I am sure I shall 
expose some of the foul meat.Behold this compost! behold it 
well!Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick 
person—yet behold! The grass of spring covers the prairies,The bean 
bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,The delicate spear 
of the onion pierces upward,The apple-buds cluster together on the 
apple-branches,The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out 
of its graves, The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and 
the mulberry-tree,The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds 
sit on their nests, The young of poultry break through 
the hatch'd eggs,The new-born of animals appear, the calf is 
dropt from the cow, the colt from the mare, Out 
of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green 
leaves,Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs
