bitter destruction, and the frighten'd monarchs come back, Each comes 
in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,Soldier, lawyer, lord, 
jailer, and sycophant.Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,Vague 
as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in 
scarlet folds, Whose face and eyes none may see,Out of 
its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the 
arm,One finger crook'd pointed high over the top, like the

counseling, cautioning. Liberty, let others despair of you—I never despair 
of you.Is the house shut? is the master away?Nevertheless, be 
ready, be not weary of watching,He will soon return, his 
messengers come anon. A HAND-MIRROR.HOLD it up sternly—see this it 
sends back, (who is it? is it you?) Outside fair 
costume, within ashes and filth,No more a flashing eye, no 
more a sonorous voice or springy step, Now some slave's 
eye, voice, hands, step,A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's
