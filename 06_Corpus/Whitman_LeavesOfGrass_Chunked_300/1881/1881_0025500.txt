and days,To celebrate the need of comrades. SCENTED HERBAGE OF 
MY BREAST.SCENTED herbage of my breast,Leaves from you I glean, 
I write, to be perused best afterwards,Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up 
above me above death,Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter 
shall not freeze you delicate leaves, Every year shall you 
bloom again, out from where you retired you shall emerge 
again; O I do not know whether many passing by 
will discover you or inhale your faint odor, but I 
believe a few will; O slender leaves! O blossoms of 
my blood! I permit you to tell in your own 
way of the heart that is under you, O I 
do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you 
are not happiness, You are often more bitter than I 
can bear, you burn and sting me,Yet you are beautiful 
to me you faint tinged roots, you make me think 
of death, Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is 
finally beautiful except death and love?) O I think it 
is not for life I am chanting here my chant 
of lovers, I think it must be for death, For 
how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the 
atmosphere of lovers, Death or life I am then indifferent, 
my soul declines to prefer,(I am not sure but the 
high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)Indeed O death, I 
think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you 
mean, Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! 
grow up out of my breast! Spring away from the 
conceal'd heart there!Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged 
roots timid leaves!Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage 
of my breast!Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad 
breast of mine, I have long enough stifled and choked;
