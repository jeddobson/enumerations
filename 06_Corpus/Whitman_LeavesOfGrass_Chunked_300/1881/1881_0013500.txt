and looking composedly down,) Where the life-car is drawn on 
the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the 
dented sand, Where the she-whale swims with her calf and 
never forsakes it,Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant

shimmers, where the neck of the long- lived swan is 
curving and winding, Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, 
where she laughs her near-human laugh, Where bee-hives range on 
a gray bench in the garden half hid by the
