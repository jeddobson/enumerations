I, But as the seasons and gravitation, and as all 
the appointed days that forgive not, I dispense from this 
side judgments inexorable without the least remorse. Consolator most mild, 
the promis'd one advancing,With gentle hand extended, the mightier God 
am I,Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt 
prophecies and poems, From this side, lo! the Lord Christ 
gazes—lo! Hermes I—lo! mine is Hercules' face, All sorrow, labor, 
suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself,Many times have I 
been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and crucified, and many 
times shall be again, All the world have I given 
up for my dear brothers' and sisters' sake, for the 
soul's sake, Wending my way through the homes of men, 
rich or poor, with the kiss of affection, For I 
am affection, I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope and 
all-enclosing charity, With indulgent words as to children, with fresh 
and sane words, mine only, Young and strong I pass 
knowing well I am destin'd myself to an early death; 
But my charity has no death—my wisdom dies not, neither 
early nor late, And my sweet love bequeath'd here and 
elsewhere never dies.Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,Comrade of criminals, brother of 
slaves,Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,With sudra face and worn brow, 
black, but in the depths of my heart, proud as 
any, Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to 
rule me,Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with 
many wiles, (Though it was thought I was baffled and 
dispel'd, and my wiles done, but that will never be,) 
Defiant, I, Satan, still live, still utter words, in new 
lands duly appearing, (and old ones also,) Permanent here from 
my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,Nor time 
nor change shall ever change me or my words.Santa Spirita,
