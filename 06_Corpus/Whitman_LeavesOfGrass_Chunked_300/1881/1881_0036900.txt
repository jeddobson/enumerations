the house or street or public assembly! Sound out, voices 
of young men! loudly and musically call me by my 
nighest name! Live, old life! play the part that looks 
back on the actor or actress!Play the old role, the 
role that is great or small according as one makes 
it! Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not 
in unknown ways be looking upon you; Be firm, rail 
over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet 
haste with the hasting current; Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, 
or wheel in large circles high in the air; Receive 
the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till 
all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! 
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my 
head, or any one's head, in the sunlit water! Come 
on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, 
white-sail'd schooners, sloops, lighters! Flaunt away, flags of all nations! 
be duly lower'd at sunset!Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! 
cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light 
over the tops of the houses! Appearances, now or henceforth, 
indicate what you are,You necessary film, continue to envelop the 
soul,About my body for me, and your body for you, 
be hung out divinest aromas, Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring 
your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, Expand, being than which 
none else is perhaps more spiritual,Keep your places, objects than 
which none else is more lasting.You have waited, you always 
wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,We receive you with free sense 
at last, and are insatiate hence- forward, Not you any 
more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves 
from us, We use you, and do not cast you 
aside—we plant you perma- nently within us, We fathom you
