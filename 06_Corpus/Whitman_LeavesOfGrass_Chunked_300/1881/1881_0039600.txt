with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to 
seek worms and aquatic plants, Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, 
from piercing the crow with its bill, for amusement—and I 
triumphantly twittering, The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in 
autumn to refresh themselves, the body of the flock feed, 
the sentinels out- side move around with erect heads watching, 
and are from time to time reliev'd by other sentinels—and 
I feeding and taking turns with the rest, In Kanadian 
forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters, 
rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, 
the hoofs as sharp as knives—and I, plunging at the

store-houses, and the countless workmen working in the shops, And 
I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in 
myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, Singing 
the song of These, my ever-united lands—my body no more 
inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a 
thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands 
are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY; Nativities, climates, the 
grass of the great pastoral Plains,Cities, labors, death, animals, products, 
war, good and evil— these me, These affording, in all 
their particulars, the old feuillage to me and to America, 
how can I do less than pass the clew of 
the union of them, to afford the like to you? 
Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine 
leaves, that you also be eligible as I am? How 
can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself 
to collect bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?
