from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.Perfume therefore my 
chant, O love, immortal love,Give me to bathe the memories

so- ciety, and of all that is begun, And how 
the States are complete in themselves—and how all triumphs and 
glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward, And how 
these of mine and of the States will in their
