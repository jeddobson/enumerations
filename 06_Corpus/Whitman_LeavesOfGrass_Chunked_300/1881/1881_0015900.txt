a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up 
too, and am tried and sentenced. Not a cholera patient 
lies at the last gasp but I also lie at 
the last gasp, My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, 
away from me people retreat. Askers embody themselves in me 
and I am embodied in them,I project my hat, sit

desire him,They desire he should like them, touch them, speak 
to them, stay with them. Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words
