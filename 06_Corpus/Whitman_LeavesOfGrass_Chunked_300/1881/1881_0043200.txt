gas, petroleum,These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,The 
Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and Gothard 
and Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge, This earth all spann'd 
with iron rails, with lines of steamships threading every sea, 
Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.8And thou America,Thy 
offspring towering e'er so high, yet higher Thee above all 
towering, With Victory on thy left, and at thy right 
hand Law;Thou Union holding all, fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,Thee, ever 
thee, I sing.Thou, also thou, a World,With all thy wide

or out of port,See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants 
of smoke.Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,Or 
in Maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful 
axemen,Wielding all day their axes.Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots 
at their wheels, thy oarsmen,How the ash writhes under those 
muscular arms!There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,Behold 
thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,Overhand so steady, overhand they 
turn and fall with joyous clank,Like a tumult of laughter.Mark 
the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,Thy continual workshops, 
foundries, risen or rising,See, from their chimneys how the tall 
flame-fires stream.Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,Thy wealthy daughter-states, Eastern
