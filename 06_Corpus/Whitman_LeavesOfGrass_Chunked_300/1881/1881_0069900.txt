mid the clustering trees, the open air camp-meeting, The fiddler 
in the tavern, the glee, the long-strung sailor-song,The lowing cattle, 
bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.All songs of current 
lands come sounding round me,The German airs of friendship, wine 
and love,Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,Chansons of 
France, Scotch tunes, and o'er the rest,Italia's peerless compositions.Across the 
stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,Stalks Norma 
brandishing the dagger in her hand.I see poor crazed Lucia's 
eyes' unnatural gleam,Her hair down her back falls loose and 
dishevel'd.I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,Amid the scent 
of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by the hand, Hears 
the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.To crossing swords 
and gray hairs bared to heaven,The clear electric base and 
baritone of the world,The trombone duo, Libertad forever!From Spanish chestnut 
trees' dense shade,By old and heavy convent walls a wailing 
song,Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life 
quench'd in despair,Song of the dying swan, Fernando's heart is 
breaking.Awaking from her woes at last retriev'd Amina sings,Copious as 
stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her 
joy.(The teeming lady comes,The lustrious orb, Venus contralto, the blooming 
mother,Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni's self I hear.)4I hear those 
odes, symphonies, operas,I hear in the William Tell the music 
of an arous'd and angry people, I hear Meyerbeer's Huguenots, 
the Prophet, or Robert, Gounod's Faust, or Mozart's Don Juan. 
I hear the dance-music of all nations,The waltz, some delicious 
measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,The bolero to tinkling guitars 
and clattering castanets.I see religious dances old and new,I hear 
the sound of the Hebrew lyre,I see the crusaders marching 
bearing the cross on high, to the martial clang of 
cymbals, I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic shouts,
