kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse, On rivers boatmen safely 
moor'd at nightfall in their boats under shelter of high 
banks, Some of the younger men dance to the sound 
of the banjo or fiddle, others sit on the gunwale 
smoking and talking; Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the 
American mimic, singing in the Great Dismal Swamp, There are 
the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous moss, the 
cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree; Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the

All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, 
reminiscences, institutions, All these States compact, every square mile of
