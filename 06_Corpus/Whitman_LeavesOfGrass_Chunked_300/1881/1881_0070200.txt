as they spin around turning always towards Mecca, I see 
the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,Again, 
at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks 
dancing,I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their 
bodies,I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.I see again 
the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers wounding each other, 
I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of 
flageolets throwing and catching their weapons, As they fall on 
their knees and rise again.I hear from the Mussulman mosque 
the muezzin calling,I see the worshippers within, nor form nor 
sermon, argument nor word, But silent, strange, devout, rais'd, glowing 
heads, ecstatic faces.I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,The 
primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,The sacred imperial hymns of 
China,To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood 
and stone,)Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of 
the vina,A band of bayaderes.5Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe 
seizing inflates me,To organs huge and bands I hear as 
from vast concourses of voices, Luther's strong hymn, Eine feste 
Burg ist unser Gott, Rossini's Stabat Mater dolorosa, Or floating 
in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color'd windows, The 
passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis. Composers! mighty maestros!And 
you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!To you 
a new bard caroling in the West,Obeisant sends his love.(Such 
led to thee O soul,All senses, shows and objects, lead 
to thee,But now it seems to me sound leads o'er 
all the rest.)I hear the annual singing of the children 
in St. Paul's cathedral,Or, under the high roof of some 
colossal hall, the symphonies, oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn, 
The Creation in billows of godhood laves me.Give me to 
hold all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,)Fill me with all
