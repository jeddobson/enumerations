see the spots of the successions of priests on the 
earth, oracles, sacrificers, brahmins, sabians, llamas, monks, muftis, ex- horters, 
I see where druids walk'd the groves of Mona, I 
see the mistletoe and vervain, I see the temples of 
the deaths of the bodies of Gods, I see the 
old signifiers. I see Christ eating the bread of his 
last supper in the midst of youths and old persons, 
I see where the strong divine young man the Hercules 
toil'd faith- fully and long and then died, I see 
the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate 
of the beautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd Bacchus, I see 
Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers 
on his head, I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-belov'd, saying 
to the people Do not weep for me, This is 
not my true country, I have lived banish'd from my 
true country, I now go back there, I return to 
the celestial sphere where every one goes in his turn.

them and blossoms and corn, I see the tracks of 
ancient and modern expeditions.I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages 
of the unknown events, heroes, records of the earth. I 
see the places of the sagas,I see pine-trees and fir-trees 
torn by northern blasts,I see granite bowlders and cliffs, I 
see green meadows and lakes,I see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian 
warriors,I see them raised high with stones by the marge 
of restless oceans, that the dead men's spirits when they 
wearied of their quiet graves might rise up through the 
mounds and gaze on the tossing billows, and be refresh'd 
by storms, immensity, liberty, action. I see the steppes of 
Asia,I see the tumuli of Mongolia, I see the tents
