I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,Solitary at 
midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me 
a long while, Walking the old hills of Judaea with 
the beautiful gentle God by my side, Speeding through space, 
speeding through heaven and the stars,Speeding amid the seven satellites 
and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand 
miles, Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,Carrying 
the crescent child that carries its own full mother in 
its belly, Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,Backing and filling, appearing 
and disappearing,I tread day and night such roads.I visit the 
orchards of spheres and look at the product,And look at 
quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.I fly those flights 
of a fluid and swallowing soul,My course runs below the 
soundings of plummets.I help myself to material and immaterial,No guard 
can shut me off, no law prevent me.I anchor my 
ship for a little while only,My messengers continually cruise away 
or bring their returns to me.I go hunting polar furs 
and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike- pointed staff, 
clinging to topples of brittle and blue. I ascend to 
the foretruck,I take my place late at night in the 
crow's-nest,We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,Through 
the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty, 
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass 
them, the scenery is plain in all directions, The white-topt 
mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies 
toward them, We are approaching some great battle-field in which 
we are soon to be engaged, We pass the colossal 
outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and 
caution, Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast 
and ruin'd city,The blocks and fallen architecture more than all
