the truth does upon itself, Or as any law of 
the earth or any natural production of the earth does. 
(This is curious and may not be realized immediately, but

that what are called lies are perfect returns, And that 
each thing exactly represents itself and what has pre- ceded 
it, And that the truth includes all, and is compact 
just as much as space is compact, And that there 
is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the 
truthâ€” but that all is truth without exception; And henceforth 
I will go celebrate any thing I see or am,And 
sing and laugh and deny nothing. A RIDDLE SONG.THAT which

utter'd,Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.Indifferently, 'mid 
public, private haunts, in solitude,Behind the mountain and the wood,Companion
