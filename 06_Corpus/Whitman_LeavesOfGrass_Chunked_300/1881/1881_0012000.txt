black muslin.) I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's 
heart's complaint,)I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in 
through my ears,It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and 
breast.I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,Ah this 
indeed is musicâ€”this suits me.A tenor large and fresh as

all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,Straining the udder of 
my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving licentious toward me, taking 
no denial,Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,Unbuttoning
