soul,Walk out with me toward the unknown region,Where neither ground 
is for the feet nor any path to follow?No map 
there, nor guide,Nor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,Nor 
face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in 
that land.I know it not O soul,Nor dost thou, all 
is a blank before us,All waits undream'd of in that 
region, that inaccessible land.Till when the ties loosen,All but the 
ties eternal, Time and Space,Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any 
bounds bounding us.Then we burst forth, we float,In Time and 
Space O soul, prepared for them,Equal, equipt at last, (O 
joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O soul. 
WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH.WHISPERS of heavenly death murmur'd I hear,Labial 
gossip of night, sibilant chorals,Footsteps gently ascending, mystical breezes wafted 
soft and low,Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current 
flowing, forever flowing,(Or is it the plashing of tears? the 
measureless waters of human tears?) I see, just see skyward, 
great cloud-masses,Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,With at 
times a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off star,Appearing and disappearing.(Some parturition rather, 
some solemn immortal birth;On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,Some soul 
is passing over.) CHANTING THE SQUARE DEIFIC.CHANTING the square deific, 
out of the One advancing, out of the sides, Out 
of the old and new, out of the square entirely 
divine,Solid, four-sided, (all the sides needed,) from this side Jehovah 
am I, Old Brahm I, and I Saturnius am;Not Time 
affects me—I am Time, old, modern as any,Unpersuadable, relentless, executing 
righteous judgments,As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, 
with laws,Aged beyond computation, yet ever new, ever with those 
mighty laws rolling, Relentless I forgive no man—whoever sins dies—I 
will have that man's life; Therefore let none expect mercy—have 
the seasons, gravitation, the appointed days, mercy? no more have
