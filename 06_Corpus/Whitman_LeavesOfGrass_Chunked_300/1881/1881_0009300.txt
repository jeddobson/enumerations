nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same, 
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and 
hospitable down by the Oconee I live, A Yankee bound 
my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest

Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin

all ages and lands, they are not original with me, 
If they are not yours as much as mine they

the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are
