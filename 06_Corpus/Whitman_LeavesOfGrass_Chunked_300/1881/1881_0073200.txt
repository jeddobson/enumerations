at least I know.Is it the prophet's thought I speak, 
or am I raving?What do I know of life? what 
of myself?I know not even my own work past or 
present,Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,Of newer better

sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,The prisoner sleeps well 
in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,The murderer that is 
to be hung next day, how does he sleep?And the 
murder'd person, how does he sleep?The female that loves unrequited 
sleeps,And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,The head of the
