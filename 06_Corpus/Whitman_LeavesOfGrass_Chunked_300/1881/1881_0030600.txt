Walt Whitman?I hear the workman singing and the farmer's wife 
singing,I hear in the distance the sounds of children and 
of animals early in the day, I hear emulous shouts 
of Australians pursuing the wild horse,I hear the Spanish dance 
with castanets in the chestnut shade, to the rebeck and 
guitar, I hear continual echoes from the Thames,I hear fierce 
French liberty songs,I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical 
recitative of old poems, I hear the locusts in Syria 
as they strike the grain and grass with the showers 
of their terrible clouds, I hear the Coptic refrain toward 
sundown, pensively falling on the breast of the black venerable 
vast mother the Nile, I hear the chirp of the 
Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule, I hear 
the Arab muezzin calling from the top of the mosque,I 
hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, 
I hear the responsive base and soprano, I hear the 
cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice putting to 
sea at Okotsk, I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle 
as the slaves march on, as the husky gangs pass 
on by twos and threes, fasten'd together with wrist-chains and 
ankle-chains, I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,I 
hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong 
legends of the Romans, I hear the tale of the 
divine life and bloody death of the beautiful God the 
Christ, I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the 
loves, wars, adages, transmitted safely to this day from poets 
who wrote three thousand years ago. 4What do you see 
Walt Whitman?Who are they you salute, and that one after 
another salute you?I see a great round wonder rolling through 
space,I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, graveyards, jails, factories, palaces,
