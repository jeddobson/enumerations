cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul, and the plenteous winterwork of 
pork-packing, Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice, the barrels 
and the half and quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the 
high piles on wharves and levees, The men and the 
work of the men on ferries, railroads, coasters, fish-boats, canals; 
The hourly routine of your own or any man's life,

brother, nighest neighbor—woman in mother, sister, wife, The popular tastes 
and employments taking precedence in poems or anywhere, You workwomen 
and workmen of these States having your own divine and 
strong life, And all else giving place to men and 
women like you.When the psalm sings instead of the singer,When 
the script preaches instead of the preacher,When the pulpit descends
