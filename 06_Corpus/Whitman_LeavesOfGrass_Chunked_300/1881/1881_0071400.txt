beauty,Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness,Unspeakable high 
processions of sun and moon and countless stars above, Below, 
the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees,With inscrutable purpose, 
some hidden prophetic intention,Now first it seems my thought begins 
to span thee.Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating,Adam 
and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them,Wandering, yearning, 
curious, with restless explorations,With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with never-happy 
hearts, With that sad incessant refrain, Wherefore unsatisfied soul? and 
Whither O mocking life? Ah who shall soothe these feverish 
children?Who justify these restless explorations?Who speak the secret of impassive 
earth?Who bind it to us? what is this separate Nature 
so unnatural?What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth, 
without a throb to answer ours, Cold earth, the place 
of graves.)Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and 
shall be carried out,Perhaps even now the time has arrived.After 
the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)After 
the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd their work, After 
the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the geologist, 
ethnologist, Finally shall come the poet worthy that name,The true 
son of God shall come singing his songs.Then not your 
deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and inventors, shall be 
justified, All these hearts as of fretted children shall be 
sooth'd,All affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall 
be told,All these separations and gaps shall be taken up 
and hook'd and link'd together, The whole earth, this cold, 
impassive, voiceless earth, shall be completely justified, Trinitas divine shall 
be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the true son of 
God, the poet, (He shall indeed pass the straits and 
conquer the mountains,He shall double the cape of Good Hope 
to some purpose,)Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd and diffused
