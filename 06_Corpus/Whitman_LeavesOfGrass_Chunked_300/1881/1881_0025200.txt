California's shores,Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,I, a child, 
very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the 
land of migrations, look afar, Look off the shores of 
my Western sea, the circle almost circled;For starting westward from 
Hindustan, from the vales of Kash- mere, From Asia, from 
the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero, 
From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice 
islands,Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,Now I 
face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,(But where is what 
I started for so long ago?And why is it yet 
unfound?) AS ADAM EARLY IN THE MORNING.AS Adam early in 
the morning,Walking forth from the bower refresh'd with sleep,Behold me 
where I pass, hear my voice, approach,Touch me, touch the 
palm of your hand to my body as I pass,Be 
not afraid of my body. 95 CALAMUS. IN PATHS UNTRODDEN.IN 
paths untrodden,In the growth by margins of pond-waters,Escaped from the 
life that exhibits itself,From all the standards hitherto publish'd, from 
the pleasures, profits, conformities, Which too long I was offering 
to feed my soul,Clear to me now standards not yet 
publish'd, clear to me that my soul, That the soul 
of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades,Here by 
myself away from the clank of the world,Tallying and talk'd 
to here by tongues aromatic,No longer abash'd, (for in this 
secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare 
elsewhere,) Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit 
itself, yet contains all the rest, Resolv'd to sing no 
songs to-day but those of manly attachment,Projecting them along that 
substantial life,Bequeathing hence types of athletic love,Afternoon this delicious Ninth-month 
in my forty-first year,I proceed for all who are or 
have been young men,To tell the secret of my nights
