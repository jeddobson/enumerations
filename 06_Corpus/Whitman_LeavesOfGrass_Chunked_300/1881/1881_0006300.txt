valv√®d voice.I mind how once we lay such a transparent 
summer morning,How you settled your head athwart my hips and 
gently turn'd over upon me, And parted the shirt from 
my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, 
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till 
you held my feet. Swiftly arose and spread around me 
the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of 
the earth, And I know that the hand of God 
is the promise of my own,And I know that the 
spirit of God is the brother of my own,And that 
all the men ever born are also my brothers, and 
the women my sisters and lovers, And that a kelson 
of the creation is love,And limitless are leaves stiff or 
drooping in the fields,And brown ants in the little wells 
beneath them,And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, 
elder, mullein and poke-weed. 6A child said What is the 
grass? fetching it to me with full hands;How could I 
answer the child? I do not know what it is 
any more than he. I guess it must be the 
flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. 
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,A 
scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,Bearing the owner's name someway 
in the corners, that we may see and remark, and 
say Whose? Or I guess the grass is itself a 
child, the produced babe of the vegetation. Or I guess 
it is a uniform hieroglyphic,And it means, Sprouting alike in 
broad zones and narrow zones,Growing among black folks as among 
white,Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I 
receive them the same. And now it seems to me 
the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly will I use you
