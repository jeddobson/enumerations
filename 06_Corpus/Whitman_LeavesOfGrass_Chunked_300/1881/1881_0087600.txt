beauty of the earth and of all the growths of 
the earth, I too have felt the resistless call of 
myself.As I steam'd down the Mississippi,As I wander'd over the

line, before I go, amid these songs,And set a tombstone 
here. MY LEGACY.THE business man the acquirer vast,After assiduous years 
surveying results, preparing for departure,Devises houses and lands to his
