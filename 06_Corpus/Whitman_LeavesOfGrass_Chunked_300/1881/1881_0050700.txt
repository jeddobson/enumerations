A BROADWAY PAGEANT.1OVER the Western sea hither from Niphon come,Courteous, 
the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, 
impassive,Ride to-day through Manhattan.Libertad! I do not know whether others 
behold what I behold,In the procession along with the nobles 
of Niphon, the errand- bearers, Bringing up the rear, hovering 
above, around, or in the ranks marching, But I will 
sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.When million-footed 
Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements,When the thunder-cracking guns arouse 
me with the proud roar I love, When the round-mouth'd 
guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit 
their salutes, When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me, 
and heaven- clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin 
haze, When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at 
the wharves, thicken with colors, When every ship richly drest 
carries her flag at the peak,When pennants trail and street-festoons 
hang from the windows,When Broadway is entirely given up to 
foot-passengers and foot- standers, when the mass is densest, When 
the fa√ßades of the houses are alive with people, when 
eyes gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time, When 
the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant moves 
forward visible, When the summons is made, when the answer 
that waited thou- sands of years answers, I too arising, 
answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the crowd, and 
gaze with them. 2Superb-faced Manhattan!Comrade Americanos! to us, then at 
last the Orient comes.To us, my city,Where our tall-topt marble 
and iron beauties range on opposite sides, to walk in 
the space between, To-day our Antipodes comes.The Originatress comes,The nest 
of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,Florid
