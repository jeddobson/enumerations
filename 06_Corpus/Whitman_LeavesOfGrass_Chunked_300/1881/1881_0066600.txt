nations, All for the modernâ€”all for the average man of 
to-day. THOUGHT.OF persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholar- 
ships, and the like; (To me all that those persons 
have arrived at sinks away from them, except as it 
results to their bodies and souls, So that often to 
me they appear gaunt and naked,And often to me each

look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,Or watch 
honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,Or animals

in the air,Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of 
stars shining so quiet and bright, Or the exquisite delicate 
thin curve of the new moon in spring;These with the 
rest, one and all, are to me miracles,The whole referring, 
yet each distinct and in its place.To me every hour
