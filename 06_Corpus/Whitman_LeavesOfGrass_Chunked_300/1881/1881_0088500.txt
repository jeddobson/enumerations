within their breasts, their brains, the sad reverberations,) The passionate 
toll and clang—city to city, joining, sounding, passing, Those heart-beats 
of a Nation in the night. AS THEY DRAW TO 
A CLOSE.AS they draw to a close,Of what underlies the 
precedent songs—of my aims in them,Of the seed I have 
sought to plant in them,Of joy, sweet joy, through many 
a year, in them,(For them, for them have I lived, 
in them my work is done,)Of many an aspiration fond, 
of many a dream and plan;Through Space and Time fused 
in a chant, and the flowing eternal identity, To Nature 
encompassing these, encompassing God—to the joy- ous, electric all, To 
the sense of Death, and accepting exulting in Death in 
its turn the same as life, The entrance of man 
to sing;To compact you, ye parted, diverse lives,To put rapport 
the mountains and rocks and streams,And the winds of the 
north, and the forests of oak and pine,With you O 
soul. JOY, SHIPMATE, JOY!JOY, shipmate, joy!(Pleas'd to my soul at 
death I cry,)Our life is closed, our life begins,The long, 
long anchorage we leave,The ship is clear at last, she 
leaps!She swiftly courses from the shore,Joy, shipmate, joy. THE UNTOLD 
WANT.THE untold want by life and land ne'er granted,Now voyager 
sail thou forth to seek and find. PORTALS.WHAT are those 
of the known but to ascend and enter the Unknown? 
And what are those of life but for Death? THESE 
CAROLS.THESE carols sung to cheer my passage through the world 
I see,For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World. NOW 
FINALÈ TO THE SHORE.NOW finalè to the shore,Now land and 
life finalè and farewell,Now Voyager depart, (much, much for thee 
is yet in store,)Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the 
seas,Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,Duly again to port and hawser's
