question and doubt whether that is really me;But among my 
lovers and caroling these songs,O I never doubt whether that 
is really me. FULL OF LIFE NOW.FULL of life now, 
compact, visible,I, forty years old the eighty-third year of the 
States,To one a century hence or any number of centuries 
hence,To you yet unborn these, seeking you.When you read these 
I that was visible am become invisible,Now it is you, 
compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me,Fancying how happy you 
were if I could be with you and become your 
comrade; Be it as if I were with you. (Be 
not too certain but I am now with you.) 112 
SALUT AU MONDE!1O TAKE my hand Walt Whitman!Such gliding wonders! 
such sights and sounds!Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to 
the next,Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.What 
widens within you Walt Whitman?What waves and soils exuding?What climes? 
what persons and cities are here?Who are the infants, some 
playing, some slumbering?Who are the girls? who are the married 
women?Who are the groups of old men going slowly with 
their arms about each other's necks? What rivers are these? 
what forests and fruits are these?What are the mountains call'd 
that rise so high in the mists?What myriads of dwellings 
are they fill'd with dwellers?2Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,Asia, 
Africa, Europe, are to the eastâ€”America is provided for in 
the west, Banding the bulge of the earth winds the 
hot equator,Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends,Within me is 
the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings, it 
does not set for months, Stretch'd in due time within 
me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon and 
sinks again, Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,Malaysia, 
Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.3What do you hear
