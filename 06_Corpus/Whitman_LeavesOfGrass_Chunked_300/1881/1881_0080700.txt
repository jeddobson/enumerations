For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at 
last in prosper- ous peace, not war;) In many a 
smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee, thou in disease 
shalt swelter, The livid cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging 
upon thy breasts, seeking to strike thee deep within, Consumption

the fulfilment of the future, the spirit of the body 
and the mind, The soul, its destinies.The soul, its destinies, 
the real real,(Purport of all these apparitions of the real;)In 
thee America, the soul, its destinies,Thou globe of globes! thou 
wonder nebulous!By many a throe of heat and cold convuls'd, 
(by these thyself solidifying,) Thou mental, moral orb—thou New, indeed 
new, Spiritual World!The Present holds thee not—for such vast growth 
as thine,For such unparallel'd flight as thine, such brood as 
thine,The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee. 351

by a windlass by those who stop ashore,Some of the 
fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand ankle- deep in 
the water, pois'd on strong legs, The boats partly drawn 
up, the water slapping against them,Strew'd on the sand in
