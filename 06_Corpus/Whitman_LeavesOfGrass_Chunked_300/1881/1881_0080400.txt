equal,) Thee in thy own musicians, singers, artists, unborn yet, 
but cer- tain, Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization, 
(until which thy proud- est material civilization must remain in 
vain,) Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship—thee in no single 
bible, saviour, merely, Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy

dash thy face, the murk of war and worse than
