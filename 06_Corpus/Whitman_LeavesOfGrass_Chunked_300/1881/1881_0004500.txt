side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony- limb'd! The 
great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and the 
inexperienced sisters! Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the 
diverse! the compact! The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!O 
all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O 
I at any rate include you all with perfect love! 
I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any 
sooner than another! O death! O for all that, I 
am yet of you unseen this hour with irrepressible love, 
Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,Splashing my bare feet 
in the edge of the summer ripples on Pau- manok's 
sands, Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in 
every town, Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,Listening to orators 
and oratresses in public halls,Of and through the States as 
during life, each man and woman my neighbor, The Louisianian, 
the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near 
to him and her, The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with 
me, and I yet with any of them, Yet upon 
the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my 
house of adobie, Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside 
State or in Maryland,Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the 
snow and ice wel- come to me, Yet a true 
son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or 
the Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State, Yet sailing 
to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every 
new brother, Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones 
from the hour they unite with the old ones, Coming 
among the new ones myself to be their companion and 
equal, coming personally to you now, Enjoining you to acts, 
characters, spectacles, with me.15With me with firm holding, yet haste,
