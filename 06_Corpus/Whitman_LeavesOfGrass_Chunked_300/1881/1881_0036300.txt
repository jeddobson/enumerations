of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, 
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,In 
the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon 
me,In my walks home late at night or as I 
lay in my bed they came upon me, I too 
had been struck from the float forever held in solution,I 
too had receiv'd identity by my body,That I was I 
knew was of my body, and what I should be 
I knew I should be of my body. 6It is 
not upon you alone the dark patches fall,The dark threw 
its patches down upon me also,The best I had done 
seem'd to me blank and suspicious,My great thoughts as I 
supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? Nor is 
it you alone who know what it is to be 
evil,I am he who knew what it was to be 
evil,I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, 
lied, stole, grudg'd,Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared 
not speak,Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,The wolf, 
the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,The cheating look, 
the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, Refusals, hates, 
postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, Was one with 
the rest, the days and haps of the rest,Was call'd 
by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young 
men as they saw me approaching or passing, Felt their 
arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent 
leaning of their flesh against me as I sat, Saw 
many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public 
assembly, yet never told them a word, Lived the same 
life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, 
Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor
