the night,I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.Ever-returning 
spring, trinity sure to me you bring,Lilac blooming perennial and 
drooping star in the west,And thought of him I love.O 
powerful western fallen star!O shades of night—O moody, tearful night!O 
great star disappear'd—O the black murk that hides the star!O 
cruel hands that hold me powerless—O helpless soul of me!O 
harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.In the 
dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings, Stands 
the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, With 
many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong 
I love, With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush 
in the dooryard,With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich 
green, A sprig with its flower I break.In the swamp 
in secluded recesses,A shy and hidden bird is warbling a 
song.Solitary the thrush,The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,Sings 
by himself a song.Song of the bleeding throat,Death's outlet song 
of life, (for well dear brother I know,If thou wast 
not granted to sing thou would'st surely die.)Over the breast 
of the spring, the land, amid cities,Amid lanes and through 
old woods, where lately the violets peep'd from the ground, 
spotting the gray debris, Amid the grass in the fields 
each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, Passing 
the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the 
dark-brown fields uprisen, Passing the apple-tree blows of white and 
pink in the orchards,Carrying a corpse to where it shall 
rest in the grave,Night and day journeys a coffin.Coffin that 
passes through lanes and streets,Through day and night with the 
great cloud darkening the land,With the pomp of the inloop'd 
flags with the cities draped in black,With the show of 
the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women standing, With processions
