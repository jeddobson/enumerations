ever-ready,Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's 
fork'd stripes! Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards—bards of California! inland bards—bards 
of the war! You by my charm I invoke. 276 
REVERSALS.LET that which stood in front go behind,Let that which 
was behind advance to the front,Let bigots, fools, unclean persons, 
offer new propositions,Let the old propositions be postponed,Let a man 
seek pleasure everywhere except in himself,Let a woman seek happiness 
everywhere except in herself. 277 AUTUMN RIVULETS. AS CONSEQUENT, Etc. 
AS consequent from store of summer rains,Or wayward rivulets in 
autumn flowing,Or many a herb-lined brook's reticulations,Or subterranean sea-rills making 
for the sea,Songs of continued years I sing.Life's ever-modern rapids 
first, (soon, soon to blend,With the old streams of death.)Some 
threading Ohio's farm-fields or the woods,Some down Colorado's cañons from 
sources of perpetual snow,Some half-hid in Oregon, or away southward 
in Texas,Some in the north finding their way to Erie, 
Niagara, Ottawa,Some to Atlantica's bays, and so to the great 
salt brine.In you whoe'er you are my book perusing,In I 
myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,All, all toward 
the mystic ocean tending.Currents for starting a continent new,Overtures sent 
to the solid out of the liquid,Fusion of ocean and 
land, tender and pensive waves,(Not safe and peaceful only, waves 
rous'd and ominous too,Out of the depths the storm's abysmic 
waves, who knows whence?Raging over the vast, with many a 
broken spar and tatter'd sail.)Or from the sea of Time, 
collecting vasting all, I bring,A windrow-drift of weeds and shells.O 
little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless,Will you not 
little shells to the tympans of temples held,Murmurs and echoes 
still call up, eternity's music faint and far,Wafted inland, sent 
from Atlantica's rim, strains for the soul of the prairies, 
Whisper'd reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously
