gibberish of the dry limbs.I ascend from the moon, I 
ascend from the night,I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is 
noonday sunbeams reflected,And debouch to the steady and central from 
the offspring great or small. 50There is that in me—I 
do not know what it is—but I know it is 
in me. Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body 
becomes,I sleep—I sleep long.I do not know it—it is without 
name—it is a word unsaid,It is not in any dictionary, 
utterance, symbol.Something it swings on more than the earth I

and sisters?It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, 
plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness. 51The past and present

multitudes.)I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on 
the door-slab.Who has done his day's work? who will soonest 
be through with his supper? Who wishes to walk with 
me?Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove 
already too late?52The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, 
he complains of my gab and my loitering. I too 
am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,I sound 
my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.The last 
scud of day holds back for me,It flings my likeness 
after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd
