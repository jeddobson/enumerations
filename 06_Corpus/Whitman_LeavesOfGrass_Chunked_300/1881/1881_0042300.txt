I forget my manners?To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed 
do I live to chant for?) to thee Columbia; In 
liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp hands,And ever henceforth sisters dear 
be both.Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days 
receive, surround you,I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of 
novel fashion,And yet the same old human race, the same 
within, without,Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings 
the same,The same old love, beauty and use the same.5We 
do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate ourselves

Freedom,The banners of the States and flags of every land,A 
brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.Somewhere within 
their walls shall all that forwards perfect human life be 
started, Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.Not only all the world 
of works, trade, products,But all the workmen of the world 
here to be represented.Here shall you trace in flowing operation,In 
every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of civilization,Materials 
here under your eye shall change their shape as if
