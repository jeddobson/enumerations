as now when my soul is rapt and at peace, 
like pleasing phantoms, Your memories rising glide silently by me.I 
saw the day the return of the heroes,(Yet the heroes 
never surpass'd shall never return,Them that day I saw not.)I 
saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,I 
saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,Streaming northward, their work 
done, camping awhile in clusters of mighty camps. No holiday 
soldiers—youthful, yet veterans,Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of 
homestead and workshop, Harden'd of many a long campaign and 
sweaty march,Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.A pause—the armies 
wait,A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,The world too waits, then

for good your deadly arms,Other the arms the fields henceforth 
for you, or South or North,With saner wars, sweet wars, 
life-giving wars.Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!The season 
of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,The chant of joy 
and power for boundless fertility.All till'd and untill'd fields expand 
before me,I see the true arenas of my race, or 
first or last,Man's innocent and strong arenas.I see the heroes 
at other toils,I see well-wielded in their hands the better 
weapons.I see where the Mother of All,With full-spanning eye gazes 
forth, dwells long,And counts the varied gathering of the products.Busy 
the far, the sunlit panorama,Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of 
the North,Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,Open 
unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,Kine and horses 
feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,And many a stately 
river flowing and many a jocund brook,And healthy uplands with
