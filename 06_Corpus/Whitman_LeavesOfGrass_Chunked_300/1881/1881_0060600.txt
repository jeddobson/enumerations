of the tranquil barns,Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the 
middle and lookest out upon thy world, and lookest East 
and lookest West, Dispensatress, that by a word givest a 
thousand miles, a million farms, and missest nothing, Thou all-acceptress—thou 
hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as God is hospitable.) When 
late I sang sad was my voice,Sad were the shows 
around me with deafening noises of hatred and smoke of 
war; In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I 
stood,Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.But 
now I sing not war,Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, 
nor the tents of camps,Nor the regiments hastily coming up 
deploying in line of battle;No more the sad, unnatural shows 
of war.Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping 
armies? Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread 
that follow'd.(Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy 
legs,With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and 
your muskets; How elate I stood and watch'd you, where 
starting off you march'd. Pass—then rattle drums again,For an army 
heaves in sight, O another gathering army,Swarming, trailing on the 
rear, O you dread accruing army,O you regiments so piteous, 
with your mortal diarrhoea, with your fever, O my land's 
maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and the crutch, 
Lo, your pallid army follows.)But on these days of brightness,On 
the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the high-piled 
farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns, Should the dead intrude?Ah 
the dead to me mar not, they fit well in 
Nature,They fit very well in the landscape under the trees 
and grass,And along the edge of the sky in the 
horizon's far margin.Nor do I forget you Departed,Nor in winter 
or summer my lost ones,But most in the open air
