of Kalmucks and Baskirs, I see the nomadic tribes with 
herds of oxen and cows,I see the table-lands notch'd with 
ravines, I see the jungles and deserts, I see the 
camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fat-tail'd sheep, the 
antelope, and the burrowing wolf. I see the highlands of 
Abyssinia,I see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, 
tamarind, date,And see fields of teff-wheat and places of verdure 
and gold.I see the Brazilian vaquero,I see the Bolivian ascending 
mount Sorata,I see the Wacho crossing the plains, I see 
the incomparable rider of horses with his lasso on his 
arm, I see over the pampas the pursuit of wild 
cattle for their hides.8I see the regions of snow and 
ice,I see the sharp- eyed Samoiede and the Finn,I see 
the seal-seeker in his boat poising his lance,I see the 
Siberian on his slight-built sledge drawn by dogs,I see the 
porpoise-hunters, I see the whale-crews of the south Pa- cific 
and the north Atlantic, I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, 
valleys, of Switzerlandâ€”I mark the long winters and the isolation.

all those cities, and rise from them again.10I see vapors 
exhaling from unexplored countries,I see the savage types, the bow 
and arrow, the poison'd splint, the fetich, and the obi.
