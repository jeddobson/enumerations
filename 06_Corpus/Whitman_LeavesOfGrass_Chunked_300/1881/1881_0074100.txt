hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head- fore- 
most on the rocks. What are you doing you ruffianly 
red-trickled waves?Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill 
him in the prime of his middle age? Steady and 
long he struggles,He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out 
while his strength holds out, The slapping eddies are spotted 
with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, 
swing him, turn him, His beautiful body is borne in 
the circling eddies, it is continually bruis'd on rocks, Swiftly 
and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.4I turn 
but do not extricate myself,Confused, a past-reading, another, but with 
darkness yet.The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the 
wreck-guns sound,The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the 
drifts.I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I 
hear the burst as she strikes, I hear the howls 
of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter. I cannot aid 
with my wringing fingers,I can but rush to the surf 
and let it drench me and freeze upon me. I 
search with the crowd, not one of the company is 
wash'd to us alive, In the morning I help pick 
up the dead and lay them in rows in a 
barn. 5Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,Washington 
stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd hills 
amid a crowd of officers, His face is cold and 
damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,He lifts the glass 
perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd from his 
cheeks, He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided 
to him by their parents. The same at last and 
at last when peace is declared,He stands in the room 
of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers all pass through,
