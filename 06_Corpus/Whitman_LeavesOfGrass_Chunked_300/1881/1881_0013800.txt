high weeds, Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on 
the ground with their heads out, Where burial coaches enter 
the arch'd gates of a cemetery,Where winter wolves bark amid 
wastes of snow and icicled trees,Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes

the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a 
candle;Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,Hurrying with the 
modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,Hot toward one
