over, and all is peace.Peace is always beautiful,The myth of 
heaven indicates peace and night.The myth of heaven indicates the 
soul,The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it 
appears less, it comes or it lags behind, It comes 
from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on itself and

flow and unite â€”they unite now. 8The sleepers are very 
beautiful as they lie unclothed,They flow hand in hand over 
the whole earth from east to west as they lie

European and American are hand in hand, Learn'd and unlearn'd 
are hand in hand, and male and female are hand 
in hand, The bare arm of the girl crosses the 
bare breast of her lover, they press close without lust, 
his lips press her neck, The father holds his grown 
or ungrown son in his arms with meas- ureless love, 
and the son holds the father in his arms with 
measureless love, The white hair of the mother shines on
