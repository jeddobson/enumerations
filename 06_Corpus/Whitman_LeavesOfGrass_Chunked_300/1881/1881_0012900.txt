is demented with the mania of owning things, Not one 
kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands 
of years ago, Not one is respectable or unhappy over 
the whole earth.So they show their relations to me and 
I accept them,They bring me tokens of myself, they evince 
them plainly in their possession. I wonder where they get 
those tokens,Did I pass that way huge times ago and

continents,I am afoot with my vision.By the city's quadrangular housesâ€”in 
log huts, camping with lumbermen, Along the ruts of the 
turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,Weeding my onion-patch 
or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing
