hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads upon the surface, 
I see the shaded part on one side where the 
sleepers are sleeping, and the sunlit part on the other 
side, I see the curious rapid change of the light 
and shade,I see distant lands, as real and near to 
the inhabitants of them as my land is to me. 
I see plenteous waters,I see mountain peaks, I see the 
sierras of Andes where they range,I see plainly the Himalayas, 
Chian Shahs, Altays, Ghauts,I see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz, 
Kazbek, Bazardjusi,I see the Styrian Alps, and the Karnac Alps,I 
see the Pyrenees, Balks, Carpathians, and to the north the 
Dofrafields, and off at sea mount Hecla, I see Vesuvius 
and Etna, the mountains of the Moon, and the Red 
mountains of Madagascar, I see the Lybian, Arabian, and Asiatic 
deserts,I see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs,I see the 
superior oceans and the inferior ones, the Atlantic and Pacific, 
the sea of Mexico, the Brazilian sea, and the sea 
of Peru, The waters of Hindustan, the China sea, and 
the gulf of Guinea,The Japan waters, the beautiful bay of 
Nagasaki land-lock'd in its mountains, The spread of the Baltic, 
Caspian, Bothnia, the British shores, and the bay of Biscay, 
The clear-sunn'd Mediterranean, and from one to another of its 
islands, The White sea, and the sea around Greenland.I behold 
the mariners of the world,Some are in storms, some in 
the night with the watch on the look- out, Some 
drifting helplessly, some with contagious diseases.I behold the sail and 
steamships of the world, some in clusters in port, some 
on their voyages, Some double the cape of Storms, some 
cape Verde, others capes Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore, Others Dondra 
head, others pass the straits of Sunda, others cape Lopatka,
