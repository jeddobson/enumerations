see what is better than to tell the best,It is 
always to leave the best untold.When I undertake to tell 
the best I find I cannot,My tongue is ineffectual on 
its pivots,My breath will not be obedient to its organs,I 
become a dumb man.The best of the earth cannot be 
told anyhow, all or any is best,It is not what 
you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,Things are not dismiss'd 
from the places they held before,The earth is just as 
positive and direct as it was before,Facts, religions, improvements, politics, 
trades, are as real as before,But the soul is also 
real, it too is positive and direct,No reasoning, no proof 
has establish'd it,Undeniable growth has establish'd it.4These to echo the 
tones of souls and the phrases of souls,(If they did 
not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?If 
they had not reference to you in especial what were 
they then?)I swear I will never henceforth have to do 
with the faith that tells the best, I will have 
to do only with that faith that leaves the best 
untold.Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!Delve! mould! pile the words 
of the earth!Work on, age after age, nothing is to 
be lost,It may have to wait long, but it will 
certainly come in use,When the materials are all prepared and 
ready, the architects shall appear. I swear to you the 
architects shall appear without fail,I swear to you they will 
understand you and justify you,The greatest among them shall be 
he who best knows you, and encloses all and is 
faithful to all, He and the rest shall not forget 
you, they shall perceive that you are not an iota 
less than they, You shall be fully glorified in them.
