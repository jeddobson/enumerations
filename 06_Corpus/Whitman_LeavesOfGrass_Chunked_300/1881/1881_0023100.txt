avows hers.Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,I will 
go stay with her who waits for me, and with 
those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me, I

fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers, The 
babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in 
their turn,I shall demand perfect men and women out of
