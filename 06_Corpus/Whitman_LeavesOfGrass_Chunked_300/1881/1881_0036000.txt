the hills southward and south-westward,Look'd on the vapor as it 
flew in fleeces tinged with violet,Look'd toward the lower bay 
to notice the vessels arriving,Saw their approach, saw aboard those 
that were near me,Saw the white sails of schooners and 
sloops, saw the ships at anchor,The sailors at work in 
the rigging or out astride the spars,The round masts, the 
swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, The 
large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their 
pilot- houses, The white wake left by the passage, the 
quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, The flags of all 
nations, the falling of them at sunset,The scallop-edged waves in 
the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening, 
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls 
of the granite storehouses by the docks, On the river 
the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on each 
side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, On 
the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning 
high and glaringly into the night, Casting their flicker of 
black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the 
tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets. 
4These and all else were to me the same as 
they are to you,I loved well those cities, loved well 
the stately and rapid river,The men and women I saw 
were all near to me,Others the same—others who look back 
on me because I look'd forward to them, (The time 
will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)5What is 
it then between us?What is the count of the scores 
or hundreds of years between us?Whatever it is, it avails 
not—distance avails not, and place avails not, I too lived, 
Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,I too walk'd the streets
