nothing,If they are not just as close as they are 
distant they are nothing. This is the grass that grows 
wherever the land is and the water is,This the common 
air that bathes the globe.18With music strong I come, with 
my cornets and my drums,I play not marches for accepted 
victors only, I play marches for conquer'd and slain persons.

lost in the same spirit in which they are won. 
I beat and pound for the dead,I blow through my 
embouchures my loudest and gayest for them. Vivas to those 
who have fail'd!And to those whose war-vessels sank in the 
sea!And to those themselves who sank in the sea!And to 
all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!And the

thief, are hereby invited,The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee 
is invited;There shall be no difference between them and the 
rest.This is the press of a bashful hand, this the 
float and odor of hair,This the touch of my lips 
to yours, this the murmur of yearning,This the far-off depth 
and height reflecting my own face,This the thoughtful merge of 
myself, and the outlet again.Do you guess I have some 
intricate purpose?Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and 
the mica on the side of a rock has. Do 
you take it I would astonish?Does the daylight astonish? does 
the early redstart twittering through the woods? Do I astonish
