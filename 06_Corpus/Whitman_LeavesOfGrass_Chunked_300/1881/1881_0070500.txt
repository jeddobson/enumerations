the voices of the universe,Endow me with their throbbings, Nature's 
also,The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches and dances, 
Utter, pour in, for I would take them all!6Then I 
woke softly,And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,And 
questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its fury,And all 
the songs of sopranos and tenors,And those rapt oriental dances

nor vast concourse of voices, nor layers of harmonies, Nor 
strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching soldiers, 
Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps,But to 
a new rhythmus fitted for thee,Poems bridging the way from 
Life to Death, vaguely wafted in night air, uncaught, unwritten, 
Which let us go forth in the bold day and 
write. 315 PASSAGE TO INDIA.1SINGING my days,Singing the great achievements 
of the present,Singing the strong light works of engineers,Our modern 
wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)In the Old World the 
east the Suez canal,The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,The 
seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires;Yet first to sound, and 
ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,The Past! the 
Past! the Past!The Past—the dark unfathom'd retrospect!The teeming gulf—the sleepers 
and the shadows!The past—the infinite greatness of the past!For what
