well,The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him 
shall take me with him all day, The farm-boy ploughing 
in the field feels good at the sound of my 
voice, In vessels that sail my words sail, I go 
with fishermen and seamen and love them. The soldier camp'd 
or upon the march is mine,On the night ere the 
pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail 
them, On that solemn night (it may be their last) 
those that know me seek me. My face rubs to 
the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his 
blanket, The driver thinking of me does not mind the 
jolt of his wagon,The young mother and old mother comprehend 
me,The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment 
and forget where they are, They and all would resume 
what I have told them.48I have said that the soul 
is not more than the body,And I have said that 
the body is not more than the soul,And nothing, not 
God, is greater to one than one's self is,And whoever 
walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral 
drest in his shroud, And I or you pocketless of 
a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, And 
to glance with an eye or show a bean in 
its pod confounds the learning of all times, And there 
is no trade or employment but the young man following 
it may become a hero, And there is no object 
so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd 
universe, And I say to any man or woman, Let 
your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes. 
And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,For 
I who am curious about each am not curious about
