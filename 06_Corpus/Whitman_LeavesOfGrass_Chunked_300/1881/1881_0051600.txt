Boston town I rose this morning early,Here's a good place 
at the corner, I must stand and see the show.Clear 
the way there Jonathan!Way for the President's marshal—way for the 
government cannon!Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the 
apparitions copiously tumbling.) I love to look on the Stars 
and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle. 
How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!Every man 
holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.A fog follows, 
antiques of the same come limping,Some appear wooden-legged, and some 
appear bandaged and bloodless. Why this is indeed a show—it 
has called the dead out of the earth! The old 
graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!Phantoms! phantoms countless 
by flank and rear!Cock'd hats of mothy mould—crutches made of 
mist!Arms in slings—old men leaning on young men's shoulders.What troubles 
you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare 
gums? Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake 
your crutches for firelocks and level them? If you blind 
your eyes with tears you will not see the President's 
marshal, If you groan such groans you might balk the 
government cannon.For shame old maniacs—bring down those toss'd arms, and 
let your white hair be, Here gape your great grandsons, 
their wives gaze at them from the windows, See how 
well dress'd, see how orderly they conduct themselves.Worse and worse—can't 
you stand it? are you retreating?Is this hour with the 
living too dead for you?Retreat then—pell-mell!To your graves—back—back to the 
hills old limpers!I do not think you belong here anyhow.But 
there is one thing that belongs here—shall I tell you 
what it is, gentlemen of Boston? I will whisper it 
to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England, 
They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with
