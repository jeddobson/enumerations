there in the White House for you, it is not 
you who are here for him, The Secretaries act in 
their bureaus for you, not you here for them,The Congress 
convenes every Twelfth-month for you,Laws, courts, the forming of States, 
the charters of cities, the going and coming of commerce 
and mails, are all for you. List close my scholars 
dear,Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,Sculpture and monuments and 
any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you, The gist 
of histories and statistics as far back as the records 
reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales 
the same, If you were not breathing and walking here, 
where would they all be? The most renown'd poems would 
be ashes, orations and plays would be vacuums. All architecture 
is what you do to it when you look upon 
it,(Did you think it was in the white or gray 
stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?) All 
music is what awakes from you when you are reminded 
by the instruments, It is not the violins and the 
cornets, it is not the oboe nor the beating drums, 
nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet 
romanza, nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of 
the women's chorus, It is nearer and farther than they.5Will 
the whole come back then?Can each see signs of the 
best by a look in the looking-glass? is there nothing 
greater or more? Does all sit there with you, with 
the mystic unseen soul?Strange and hard that paradox true I 
give,Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.House-building, measuring, sawing 
the boards,Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin-roofing, shingle-dressing, Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, 
flagging of sidewalks by flaggers, The pump, the pile-driver, the 
great derrick, the coal-kiln and brick-kiln, Coal-mines and all that
