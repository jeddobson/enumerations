turn be con- vuls'd, and serve other parturitions and transitions, 
And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too, 
serve—and how every fact, and war itself, with all its 
horrors, serves, And how now or at any time each 
serves the exquisite transition of death. Of seeds dropping into 
the ground, of births,Of the steady concentration of America, inland, 
upward, to im- pregnable and swarming places, Of what Indiana, 
Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,Of what a 
few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, and 
the rest, (Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka 
or Aliaska,)Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation 
for—and of what all sights, North, South, East and West, 
are, Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn 
price paid, of the unnamed lost ever present in my 
mind; Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,Of 
the present, passing, departing—of the growth of completer men than 
any yet, Of all sloping down there where the fresh 
free giver the mother, the Mississippi flows, Of mighty inland 
cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,Of the new and good names, 
of the modern developments, of inalienable homesteads, Of a free 
and original life there, of simple diet and clean and 
sweet blood, Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect 
physique there,Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each 
side of the Anahuacs, Of these songs, well understood there, 
(being made for that area,)Of the native scorn of grossness 
and gain there,(O it lurks in me night and day—what 
is gain after all to savage- ness and freedom?) SONG 
AT SUNSET.SPLENDOR of ended day floating and filling me,Hour prophetic, 
hour resuming the past,Inflating my throat, you divine average,You earth 
and life till the last ray gleams I sing.Open mouth
