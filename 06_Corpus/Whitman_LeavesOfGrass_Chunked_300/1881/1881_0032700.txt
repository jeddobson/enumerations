sweat-drops or blood-drops!You human forms with the fathomless ever-impressive counte- 
nances of brutes! You poor koboo whom the meanest of 
the rest look down upon for all your glimmering language 
and spirituality! You dwarf'd Kamtschatkan, Greenlander, Lapp!You Austral negro, naked, 
red, sooty, with protrusive lip, groveling, seeking your food! You

penetrates I penetrate those cities myself, All islands to which 
birds wing their way I wing my way myself.Toward you 
all, in America's name,I raise high the perpendicular hand, I 
make the signal,To remain after me in sight forever,For all 
the haunts and homes of men. 120 SONG OF THE 
OPEN ROAD.1AFOOT and light-hearted I take to the open road,Healthy, 
free, the world before me,The long brown path before me 
leading wherever I choose.Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself
