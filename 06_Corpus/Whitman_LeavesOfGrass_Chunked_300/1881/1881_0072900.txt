to come to Thee, Thou knowest I have in age 
ratified all those vows and strictly kept them, Thou knowest 
I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in 
Thee,In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,Accepting all from Thee, 
as duly come from Thee.All my emprises have been fill'd 
with Thee,My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts 
of Thee,Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;Intentions, 
purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to Thee.O I am sure 
they really came from Thee,The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable 
will,The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,A message from 
the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,These sped me 
on.By me and these the work so far accomplish'd,By me 
earth's elder cloy'd and stifled lands uncloy'd, unloos'd,By me the 
hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the known.The end 
I know not, it is all in Thee,Or small or 
great I know notâ€”haply what broad fields, what lands,Haply the 
brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,Transplanted there may rise to 
stature, knowledge worthy Thee,Haply the swords I know may there 
indeed be turn'd to reaping- tools, Haply the lifeless cross 
I know, Europe's dead cross, may bud and blossom there. 
One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;That Thou O 
God my life hast lighted,With ray of light, steady, ineffable, 
vouchsafed of Thee,Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,Beyond all 
signs, descriptions, languages;For that O God, be it my latest 
word, here on my knees,Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank 
Thee.My terminus near,The clouds already closing in upon me,The voyage 
balk'd, the course disputed, lost,I yield my ships to Thee.My 
hands, my limbs grow nerveless,My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd,Let the 
old timbers part, I will not part,I will cling fast 
to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,Thee, Thee
