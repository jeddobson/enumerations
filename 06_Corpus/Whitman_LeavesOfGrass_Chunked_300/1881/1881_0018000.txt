things to be. My feet strike an apex of the 
apices of the stairs,On every step bunches of ages, and 
larger bunches between the steps, All below duly travel'd, and 
still I mount and mount.Rise after rise bow the phantoms 
behind me,Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I 
know I was even there,I waited unseen and always, and 
slept through the lethargic mist,And took my time, and took 
no hurt from the fetid carbon.Long I was hugg'd closeâ€”long

with soft balsamic busses,Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts 
and giving them to be mine. Old age superbly rising! 
O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days! Every condition promulges 
not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out
