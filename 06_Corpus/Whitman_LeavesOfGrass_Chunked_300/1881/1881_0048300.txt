prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,All 
the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the 
dying,Pioneers! O pioneers!I too with my soul and body,We, a 
curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,Through these shores amid 
the shadows, with the apparitions pressing, Pioneers! O pioneers!Lo, the 
darting bowling orb!Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering 
suns and planets,All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights 
with dreams,Pioneers! O pioneers!These are of us, they are with 
us,All for primal needed work, while the followers there in 
embryo wait behind, We to-day's procession heading, we the route 
for travel clearing,Pioneers! O pioneers!O you daughters of the West!O 
you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you 
wives!Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move 
united,Pioneers! O pioneers!Minstrels latent on the prairies!(Shrouded bards of other 
lands, you may rest, you have done your work,) Soon 
I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp 
amid us,Pioneers! O pioneers!Not for delectations sweet,Not the cushion and 
the slipper, not the peaceful and the studious,Not the riches 
safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,Pioneers! O 
pioneers!Do the feasters gluttonous feast?Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have 
they lock'd and bolted doors?Still be ours the diet hard, 
and the blanket on the ground,Pioneers! O pioneers!Has the night 
descended?Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop 
discouraged nodding on our way? Yet a passing hour I 
yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,Pioneers! O pioneers!Till 
with sound of trumpet,Far, far off the daybreak call—hark! how 
loud and clear I hear it wind, Swift! to the 
head of the army!—swift! spring to your places,Pioneers! O pioneers! 
TO YOU.WHOEVER you are, I fear you are walking the 
walks of dreams,I fear these supposed realities are to melt
