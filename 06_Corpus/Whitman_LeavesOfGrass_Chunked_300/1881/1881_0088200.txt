OF GREEN.NOT alone those camps of white, old comrades of 
the wars,When as order'd forward, after a long march,Footsore and 
weary, soon as the light lessens we halt for the 
night,Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack, 
dropping asleep in our tracks, Others pitching the little tents, 
and the fires lit up begin to sparkle, Outposts of 
pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark,And a word provided

us O soldiers, and of each and all in the 
ranks we fought, (There without hatred we all, all meet.)For 
presently O soldiers, we too camp in our place in 
the bivouac- camps of green, But we need not provide 
for outposts, nor word for the counter- sign, Nor drummer 
to beat the morning drum. THE SOBBING OF THE BELLS.( 
Midnight, Sept. 19-20, 1881.)THE sobbing of the bells, the sudden 
death-news everywhere,The slumberers rouse, the rapport of the People,(Full well 
they know that message in the darkness,Full well return, respond
