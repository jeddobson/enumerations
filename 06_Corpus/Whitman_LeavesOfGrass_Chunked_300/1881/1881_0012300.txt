my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion 
with the calm of the sunlight and pasture- fields, Immodestly 
sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap off with touch 
and go and graze at the edges of me, No 
consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,Fetching 
the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a 
while,Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry 
me.The sentries desert every other part of me,They have left 
me helpless to a red marauder,They all come to the 
headland to witness and assist against me.I am given up 
by traitors,I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I 
and nobody else am the greatest traitor, I went myself 
first to the headland, my own hands carried me there. 
You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is 
tight in its throat, Unclench your floodgates, you are too 
much for me.29Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch! 
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?Parting track'd by 
arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,Rich showering rain, and recompense 
richer afterward.Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific 
and vital,Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.30All truths wait in 
all things,They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,They 
do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,The insignificant 
is as big to me as any,(What is less or 
more than a touch?)Logic and sermons never convince,The damp of 
the night drives deeper into my soul.(Only what proves itself 
to every man and woman is so,Only what nobody denies 
is so.)A minute and a drop of me settle my 
brain,I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,And 
a compend of compends is the meat of a man 
or woman,And a summit and flower there is the feeling
