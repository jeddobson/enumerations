world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,Like 
a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,Emblem of general 
maternity lifted above all,Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters 
and sons,Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in 
ceaseless procession issuing, Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving

doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;Thee in 
thy larger, saner brood of female, male—thee in thy athletes, 
moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East, (To thy immortal breasts, 
Mother of All, thy every daughter, son, endear'd alike, forever
