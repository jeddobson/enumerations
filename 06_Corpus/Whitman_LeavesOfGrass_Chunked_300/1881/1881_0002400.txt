in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my 
drink from the spring, Or withdrawn to muse and meditate 
in some deep recess,Far from the clank of crowds intervals 
passing rapt and happy,Aware of the fresh free giver the 
flowing Missouri, aware of mighty Niagara, Aware of the buffalo 
herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and strong-breasted bull, Of 
earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow, my amaze, 
Having studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the 
mountain-hawk, And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit 
thrush from the swamp-cedars, Solitary, singing in the West, I 
strike up for a New World.2Victory, union, faith, identity, time,The 
indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern 
reports.This then is life,Here is what has come to the 
surface after so many throes and convulsions. How curious! how 
real!Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.See revolving the globe,The 
ancestor-continents away group'd together,The present and future continents north and 
south, with the isthmus between. See, vast trackless spaces,As in 
a dream they change, they swiftly fill,Countless masses debouch upon 
them,They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts, institutions, 
known. See, projected through time,For me an audience interminable.With firm 
and regular step they wend, they never stop,Successions of men, 
Americanos, a hundred millions,One generation playing its part and passing 
on,Another generation playing its part and passing on in its 
turn,With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,With 
eyes retrospective towards me.3Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!Foremost! century marches! Libertad! 
masses!For you a programme of chants.Chants of the prairies,Chants of 
the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea, Chants 
of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,Chants going forth 
from the centre from Kansas, and thence equi- distant, Shooting 
in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.4Take my leaves
