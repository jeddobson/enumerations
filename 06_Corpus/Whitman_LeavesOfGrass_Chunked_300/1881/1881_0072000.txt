walks in some great scena,Dominating the rest I see the 
Admiral himself,(History's type of courage, action, faith,)Behold him sail from 
Palos leading his little fleet,His voyage behold, his return, his 
great fame,His misfortunes, calumniators, behold him a prisoner, chain'd,Behold his 
dejection, poverty, death.(Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts 
of heroes,Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?Lies 
the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? lo, to 
God's due occasion, Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,And 
fills the earth with use and beauty.)7Passage indeed O soul 
to primal thought,Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear 
freshness,The young maturity of brood and bloom,To realms of budding 
bibles.O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,Thy 
circumnavigation of the world begin,Of man, the voyage of his 
mind's return,To reason's early paradise,Back, back to wisdom's birth, to 
innocent intuitions,Again with fair creation.8O we can wait no longer,We 
too take ship O soul,Joyous we too launch out on 
trackless seas,Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to 
sail,Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I 
thee to me, O soul,) Caroling free, singing our song 
of God,Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.With laugh and many 
a kiss,(Let others deprecate, let others weep for sin, remorse, 
humilia- tion,) O soul thou pleasest me, I thee.Ah more 
than any priest O soul we too believe in God,But 
with the mystery of God we dare not dally.O soul 
thou pleasest me, I thee,Sailing these seas or on the 
hills, or waking in the night,Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time 
and Space and Death, like waters flowing, Bear me indeed 
as through the regions infinite,Whose air I breathe, whose ripples 
hear, lave me all over,Bathe me O God in thee, 
mounting to thee,I and my soul to range in range
