day, for all its names.) The singers of successive hours 
of centuries may have ostensible names, but the name of 
each of them is one of the singers, The name 
of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer, sweet- singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, 
love-singer, weird-singer, or something else. All this time and at 
all times wait the words of true poems,The words of 
true poems do not merely please,The true poets are not 
followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty; The 
greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of

races, creeds, and the sexes,They do not seek beauty, they 
are sought,Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, 
longing, fain, love-sick. They prepare for death, yet are they 
not the finish, but rather the outset, They bring none 
to his or her terminus or to be content and 
full,Whom they take they take into space to behold the 
birth of stars, to learn one of the meanings, To 
launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless 
rings and never be quiet again. 138 OUR OLD FEUILLAGE.ALWAYS
