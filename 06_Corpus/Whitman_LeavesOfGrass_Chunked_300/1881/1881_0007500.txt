hand, She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her 
coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd 
to her feet. The runaway slave came to my house 
and stopt outside,I heard his motions crackling the twigs of 
the woodpile,Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw 
him limpsy and weak, And went where he sat on 
a log and led him in and assured him,And brought 
water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and 
bruis'd feet, And gave him a room that enter'd from 
my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes, And 
remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,And remember 
putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;He 
staid with me a week before he was recuperated and 
pass'd north, I had him sit next me at table, 
my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.11Twenty-eight young men bathe by 
the shore,Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;Twenty-eight years of 
womanly life and all so lonesome.She owns the fine house 
by the rise of the bank,She hides handsome and richly 
drest aft the blinds of the window.Which of the young 
men does she like the best?Ah the homeliest of them 
is beautiful to her.Where are you off to, lady? for 
I see you,You splash in the water there, yet stay 
stock still in your room.Dancing and laughing along the beach 
came the twenty-ninth bather,The rest did not see her, but 
she saw them and loved them.The beards of the young 
men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long hair, 
Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.An unseen hand also 
pass'd over their bodies,It descended tremblingly from their temples and 
ribs.The young men float on their backs, their white bellies 
bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes
