night in silence under many a star,The ocean shore and 
the husky whispering wave whose voice I know, And the 
soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,And the 
body gratefully nestling close to thee.Over the tree-tops I float 
thee a song,Over the rising and sinking waves, over the 
myriad fields and the prairies wide, Over the dense-pack'd cities 
all and the teeming wharves and ways,I float this carol 
with joy, with joy to thee O death.To the tally 
of my soul,Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,With 
pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.Loud in the pines 
and cedars dim,Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,And 
I with my comrades there in the night.While my sight 
that was bound in my eyes unclosed,As to long panoramas 
of visions.And I saw askant the armies,I saw as in 
noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,Borne through the smoke of the 
battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw them, And carried 
hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, 
And at last but a few shreds left on the 
staffs, (and all in silence,)And the staffs all splinter'd and 
broken.I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,And the white skeletons of 
young men, I saw them,I saw the debris and debris 
of all the slain soldiers of the war,But I saw 
they were not as was thought,They themselveswere fully at rest, 
they suffer'd not,The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,And 
the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,And 
the armies that remain'd suffer'd.Passing the visions, passing the night,Passing, 
unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,Passing the song of 
the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, 
Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,As low 
and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding
