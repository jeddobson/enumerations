yourself, (the same monoto- nous old song.)17O I see flashing 
that this America is only you and me, Its power, 
weapons, testimony, are you and me, Its crimes, lies, thefts, 
defections, are you and me, Its Congress is you and 
me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships, are you and me, 
Its endless gestations of new States are you and me, 
The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war 
I will henceforth forget), was you and me, Natural and 
artificial are you and me, Freedom, language, poems, employments, are 
you and me, Past, present, future, are you and me. 
I dare not shirk any part of myself, Not any 
part of America good or bad, Not to build for 
that which builds for mankind, Not to balance ranks, complexions, 
creeds, and the sexes, Not to justify science nor the 
march of equality, Nor to feed the arrogant blood of 
the brawn belov'd of time. I am for those that 
have never been master'd, For men and women whose tempers 
have never been master'd, For those whom laws, theories, conventions, 
can never master. I am for those who walk abreast 
with the whole earth, Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all. 
I will not be outfaced by irrational things, I will 
penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon 
me, I will make cities and civilizations defer to me, 
This is what I have learnt from Americaâ€”it is the 
amount, and it I teach again. (Democracy, while weapons were 
everywhere aim'd at your breast, I saw you serenely give 
birth to immortal children, saw in dreams your dilating form, 
Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)18I will confront 
these shows of the day and night, I will know 
if I am to be less than they, I will
