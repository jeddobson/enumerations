with the Western movement beat, Holding single or together, steady 
moving to the front, all for us, Pioneers! O pioneers! 
Life's involv'd and varied pageants, All the forms and shows, 
all the workmen at their work, All the seamen and 
the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves, Pioneers! O 
pioneers! All the hapless silent lovers, All the prisoners in 
the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked, All the 
joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying, 
Pioneers! O pioneers! I too with my soul and body, 
We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way, Through 
these shores amid the shadows, with the apparitions pressing, Pioneers! 
O pioneers! Lo, the darting bowling orb! Lo, the brother 
orbs around, all the clustering suns and planets, All the 
dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams, Pioneers! O 
pioneers! These are of us, they are with us, All 
for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo 
wait behind, We to-day's procession heading, we the route for 
travel clearing, Pioneers! O pioneers! O you daughters of the 
West! O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers 
and you wives! Never must you be divided, in our 
ranks you move united, Pioneers! O pioneers! Minstrels latent on 
the prairies! (Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, 
you have done your work,) Soon I hear you coming 
warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us, Pioneers! O 
pioneers! Not for delectations sweet, Not the cushion and the 
slipper, not the peaceful and the studious, Not the riches 
safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment, Pioneers! 
O pioneers! Do the feasters gluttonous feast? Do the corpulent 
sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and bolted doors? Still be 
ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,
