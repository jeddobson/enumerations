the whale-crews of the south Pa- cific and the north 
Atlantic, I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switzerlandâ€”I 
mark the long winters and the isolation. I see the 
cities of the earth and make myself at random a 
part of them, I am a real Parisian, I am 
a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople, I am 
of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne, I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, 
Edinburgh, Limerick, I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, 
Brussels, Berne, Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence, I belong in Moscow, 
Cracow, Warsaw, or northward in Christiania or Stockholm, or in 
Siberian Irkutsk, or in some street in Iceland, I descend 
upon all those cities, and rise from them again. 10I 
see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries, I see the savage 
types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd splint, the fetich, 
and the obi. I see African and Asiatic towns, I 
see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo, Monrovia, I see the 
swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi, Calcutta, Tokio,I see the 
Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and Ashantee-man in 
their huts, I see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo, 
I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva 
and those of Herat, I see Teheran, I see Muscat 
and Medina and the intervening sands, I see the caravans 
toiling onward, I see Egypt and the Egyptians, I see 
the pyramids and obelisks, I look on chisell'd histories, records 
of conquering kings, dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or 
on granite-blocks, I see at Memphis mummy-pits containing mummies embalm'd, 
swathed in linen cloth, lying there many centuries, I look 
on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping neck, 
the hands folded across the breast. I see all the 
menials of the earth, laboring, I see all the prisoners
