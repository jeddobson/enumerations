the distance, Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front, Thy 
long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple, The dense 
and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack, Thy knitted frame, 
thy springs and valves, the tremulous twinkle of thy wheels, 
Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily following, Through gale 
or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering; Type 
of the modern—emblem of motion and power—pulse of the continent, 
For once come serve the Muse and merge in verse, 
even as here I see thee, With storm and buffeting 
gusts of wind and falling snow, By day thy warning 
ringing bell to sound its notes, By night thy silent 
signal lamps to swing. Fierce-throated beauty! Roll through my chant 
with all thy lawless music, thy swinging lamps at night, 
Thy madly-whistled laughter, echoing, rumbling like an earth- quake, rousing 
all, Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding, 
(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,) 
Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd, Launch'd 
o'er the prairies wide, across the lakes, To the free 
skies unpent and glad and strong. O MAGNET-SOUTH.O MAGNET-SOUTH! O 
glistening perfumed South! my South! O quick mettle, rich blood, 
impulse and love! good and evil! O all dear to 
me! O dear to me my birth-things—all moving things and 
the trees where I was born—the grains, plants, rivers, Dear 
to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, 
distant, over flats of silvery sands or through swamps, Dear 
to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the Pedee, 
the Tombigbee, the Santee, the Coosa and the Sabine, O 
pensive, far away wandering, I return with my soul to 
haunt their banks again, Again in Florida I float on 
transparent lakes, I float on the Okee- chobee, I cross
