death.) 417 A VOICE FROM DEATH.(The Johnstown, Penn., cataclysm, May 
31, 1889.)A VOICE from Death, solemn and strange, in all 
his sweep and power, With sudden, indescribable blow—towns drown'd—humanity by 
thousands slain, The vaunted work of thrift, goods, dwellings, forge, 
street, iron bridge, Dash'd pell-mell by the blow—yet usher'd life 
continuing on, (Amid the rest, amid the rushing, whirling, wild 
debris, A suffering woman saved—a baby safely born!)Although I come 
and unannounc'd, in horror and in pang, In pouring flood 
and fire, and wholesale elemental crash, (this voice so solemn, 
strange,) I too a minister of Deity. Yea, Death, we 
bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee, We mourn 
the old, the young untimely drawn to thee, The fair, 
the strong, the good, the capable, The household wreck'd, the 
husband and the wife, the engulf'd forger in his forge, 
The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud, The 
gather'd thousands to their funeral mounds, and thousands never found 
or gather'd. Then after burying, mourning the dead, (Faithful to 
them found or unfound, forgetting not, bearing the past, here

bends low, Silent, resign'd, submissive. War, death, cataclysm like this, 
America, Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart. E'en as 
I chant, lo! out of death, and out of ooze 
and slime, The blossoms rapidly blooming, sympathy, help, love, From 
West and East, from South and North and over sea, 
Its hot-spurr'd hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves 
on; And from within a thought and lesson yet. Thou 
ever-darting Globe! through Space and Air! Thou waters that encompass 
us! Thou that in all the life and death of 
us, in action or in sleep! Thou laws invisible that 
permeate them and all, Thou that in all, and over
