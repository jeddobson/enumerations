drift of them is something grand, I do not know 
what it is except that it is grand, and that 
it is happiness, And that the enclosing purport of us 
here is not a speculation or bon-mot or reconnoissance, And 
that it is not something which by luck may turn 
out well for us, and without luck must be a 
failure for us, And not something which may yet be 
retracted in a certain contingency. The light and shade, the 
curious sense of body and identity, the greed that with 
perfect complaisance devours all things, The endless pride and outstretching 
of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows, The wonder every one 
sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders 
that fill each minute of time forever, What have you 
reckon'd them for, camerado? Have you reckon'd them for your 
trade or farm-work? or for the profits of your store? 
Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a 
gentleman's leisure, or a lady's leisure? Have you reckon'd that 
the landscape took substance and form that it might be 
painted in a picture? Or men and women that they 
might be written of, and songs sung? Or the attraction 
of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious combinations and 
the fluids of the air, as subjects for the savans? 
Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps 
and charts? Or the stars to be put in constellations 
and named fancy names? Or that the growth of seeds 
is for agricultural tables, or agricul- ture itself? Old institutions, 
these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the practice handed along 
in manufactures, will we rate them so high? Will we 
rate our cash and business high? I have no objection, 
I rate them as high as the highestâ€”then a child
