in the placid pastoral region. AN OLD MAN'S THOUGHT OF 
SCHOOL.For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, 
1874.AN old man's thought of school, An old man gathering 
youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot. Now only

loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be turn'd, If 
vermin so transposed, so used and bless'd may be, Then 
may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;
