change their shape as if by magic, The cotton shall 
be pick'd almost in the very field, Shall be dried, 
clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread and cloth before you, 
You shall see hands at work at all the old 
processes and all the new ones, You shall see the 
various grains and how flour is made and then bread 
baked by the bakers, You shall see the crude ores 
of California and Nevada passing on and on till they 
become bullion, You shall watch how the printer sets type, 
and learn what a com- posing-stick is, You shall mark 
in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders, shedding the 
printed leaves steady and fast, The photograph, model, watch, pin, 
nail, shall be created before you. In large calm halls, 
a stately museum shall teach you the infinite lessons of 
minerals, In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated—in another 
animals, animal life and development. One stately house shall be 
the music house, Others for other arts—learning, the sciences, shall 
all be here, None shall be slighted, none but shall 
here be honor'd, help'd, exampled. 6(This, this and these, America, 
shall be your pyramids and obelisks, Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens 
of Babylon, Your temple at Olympia.)The male and female many 
laboring not, Shall ever here confront the laboring many, With 
precious benefits to both, glory to all, To thee America, 
and thee eternal Muse. And here shall ye inhabit powerful 
Matrons! In your vast state vaster than all the old, 
Echoed through long, long centuries to come, To sound of 
different, prouder songs, with stronger themes, Practical, peaceful life, the 
people's life, the People themselves, Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace—elate, 
secure in peace. 7Away with themes of war! away with 
war itself! Hence from my shuddering sight to never more
