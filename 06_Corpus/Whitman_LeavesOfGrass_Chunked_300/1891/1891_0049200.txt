to himâ€”it cannot fail, The oration is to the orator, 
the acting is to the actor and actress not to 
the audience, And no man understands any greatness or goodness 
but his own, or the indication of his own. 3I 
swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or 
her who shall be complete, The earth remains jagged and 
broken only to him or her who remains jagged and 
broken. I swear there is no greatness or power that 
does not emulate those of the earth, There can be 
no theory of any account unless it corroborate the theory 
of the earth, No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what 
not, is of account, unless it compare with the amplitude 
of the earth, Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, 
rectitude of the earth. I swear I begin to see 
love with sweeter spasms than that which responds love, It 
is that which contains itself, which never invites and never 
refuses. I swear I begin to see little or nothing 
in audible words, All merges toward the presentation of the 
unspoken meanings of the earth, Toward him who sings the 
songs of the body and of the truths of the 
earth, Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that 
print can- not touch. I swear I see what is 
better than to tell the best, It is always to 
leave the best untold. When I undertake to tell the 
best I find I cannot, My tongue is ineffectual on 
its pivots, My breath will not be obedient to its 
organs, I become a dumb man. The best of the 
earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best, 
It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, 
nearer, Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held
