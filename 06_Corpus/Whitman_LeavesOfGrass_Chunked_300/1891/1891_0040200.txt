for yourself poems, religions, politics, war, peace, behavior, histories, essays, 
daily life, and every thing else, They balance ranks, colors, 
races, creeds, and the sexes, They do not seek beauty, 
they are sought, Forever touching them or close upon them 
follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick. They prepare for death, yet 
are they not the finish, but rather the outset, They 
bring none to his or her terminus or to be 
content and full, Whom they take they take into space 
to behold the birth of stars, to learn one of 
the meanings, To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep 
through the ceaseless rings and never be quiet again. 138 
OUR OLD FEUILLAGE.ALWAYS our old feuillage! Always Florida's green peninsula—always 
the priceless delta of Louisiana—always the cotton-fields of Alabama and 
Texas, Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver 
moun- tains of New Mexico—always soft-breath'd Cuba, Always the vast 
slope drain'd by the Southern sea, inseparable with the slopes 
drain'd by the Eastern and Western seas, The area the 
eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half 
millions of square miles, The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast 
and bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand miles of 
river navigation, The seven millions of distinct families and the 
same number of dwellings—always these, and more, branching forth into 
numberless branches,Always the free range and diversity—always the continent of 
Democracy; Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada, 
the snows; Always these compact lands tied at the hips 
with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes; Always the 
West with strong native persons, the increasing density there, the 
habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning invaders; All sights, South, North, 
East—all deeds, promiscuously done at all times, All characters, movements, 
growths, a few noticed, myriads unno- ticed, Through Mannahatta's streets
