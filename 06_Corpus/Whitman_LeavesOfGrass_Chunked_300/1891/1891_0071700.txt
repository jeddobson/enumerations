them, others are spearing salmon, The canoe, a dim shadowy 
thing, moves across the black water, Bearing a torch ablaze 
at the prow. O STAR OF FRANCE.1870-71.O STAR of France, 
The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame, Like 
some proud ship that led the fleet so long, Beseems 
to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk, 
And 'mid its teeming madden'd half-drown'd crowds, Nor helm nor

from its spasms of fury and its poisons, Issuing at 
last in perfect power and beauty, Onward beneath the sun 
following its course, So thee O ship of France! Finish'd
