might you find you have come from yourself, if you 
could trace back through the centuries?)8A woman's body at auction, 
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming

is sacred the human body is sacred, And the glory

(and that they are the soul,) I believe the likes 
of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and 
that they are my poems, Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, 
husband's, mother's, father's, young man's, young woman's poems, Head, neck, 
hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, Eyes, eye-fringes, 
iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping 
of the lids, Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the 
mouth, jaws, and the jaw- hinges, Nose, nostrils of the 
nose, and the partition, Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back 
of the neck, neck- slue, Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula,
