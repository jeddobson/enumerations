How can you be alive you growths of spring? How 
can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, 
grain? Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you? 
Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour 
dead? Where have you disposed of their carcasses? Those drunkards 
and gluttons of so many generations? Where have you drawn 
off all the foul liquid and meat? I do not 
see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I 
am deceiv'd, I will run a furrow with my plough, 
I will press my spade through the sod and turn 
it up underneath, I am sure I shall expose some 
of the foul meat. 2Behold this compost! behold it well! 
Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick 
personâ€”yet behold! The grass of spring covers the prairies, The 
bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden, The 
delicate spear of the onion pierces upward, The apple-buds cluster 
together on the apple-branches, The resurrection of the wheat appears 
with pale visage out of its graves, The tinge awakes 
over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree, The he-birds carol mornings 
and evenings while the she-birds sit on their nests, The 
young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs, The new-born 
of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, 
the colt from the mare, Out of its little hill 
faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves, Out of its 
hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in the 
dooryards, The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all 
those strata of sour dead. What chemistry! That the winds 
are really not infectious, That this is no cheat, this 
transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous after 
me, That it is safe to allow it to lick
