the copiousness, the individuality of the States, each for itself—the 
money- makers, Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, 
pulley, all certainties, The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, 
In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars—on the 
firm earth, the lands, my lands, O lands! all so 
dear to me—what you are, (whatever it is,) I putting 
it at random in these songs, become a part of 
that, whatever it is, Southward there, I screaming, with wings 
slow flapping, with the myriads of gulls wintering along the 
coasts of Florida, Otherways there atwixt the banks of the 
Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, 
the Red River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with 
the spring waters laughing and skipping and running, Northward, on 
the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with 
parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek 
worms and aquatic plants, Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from 
piercing the crow with its bill, for amusement—and I triumphantly 
twittering, The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn 
to refresh themselves, the body of the flock feed, the 
sentinels out- side move around with erect heads watching, and 
are from time to time reliev'd by other sentinels—and I 
feeding and taking turns with the rest, In Kanadian forests 
the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters, rising 
desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the 
hoofs as sharp as knives—and I, plunging at the hunters, 
corner'd and desperate,In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and 
the countless workmen working in the shops, And I too 
of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in myself than 
the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, Singing the song 
of These, my ever-united lands—my body no more inevitably united,
