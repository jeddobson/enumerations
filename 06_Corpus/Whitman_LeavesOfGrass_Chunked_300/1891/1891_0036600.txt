the travel they tend to, and the days and nights 
they tend to, Again to merge them in the start 
of superior journeys, To see nothing anywhere but what you 
may reach it and pass it, To conceive no time, 
however distant, but what you may reach it and pass 
it, To look up or down no road but it 
stretches and waits for you, however long but it stretches 
and waits for you, To see no being, not God's 
or any, but you also go thither, To see no 
possession, but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor 
or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle 
of it, To take the best of the farmer's farm 
and the rich man's elegant villa, and the chaste blessings 
of the well-married couple, and the fruits of orchards and 
flowers of gardens, To take to your use out of 
the compact cities as you pass through, To carry buildings 
and streets with you afterward wherever you go, To gather 
the minds of men out of their brains as you 
encounter them, to gather the love out of their hearts, 
To take your lovers on the road with you, for 
all that you leave them behind you, To know the 
universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads 
for traveling souls. All parts away for the progress of 
souls, All religion, all solid things, arts, governmentsâ€”all that was 
or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls 
into niches and corners before the procession of souls along 
the grand roads of the universe. Of the progress of 
the souls of men and women along the grand roads 
of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem 
and sustenance. Forever alive, forever forward, Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn,
