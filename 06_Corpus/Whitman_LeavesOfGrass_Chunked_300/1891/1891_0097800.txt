the soft-falling shower, Which, strange to tell, gave me an 
answer, as here translated: I am the Poem of Earth, 
said the voice of the rain, Eternal I rise impalpable 
out of the land and the bottomless sea, Upward to 
heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed, and yet the same,

only, latent, unborn; And forever, by day and night, I 
give back life to my own origin, and make pure 
and beautify it; (For song, issuing from its birth-place, after

and cherry; With these the robin, lark and thrush, singing 
their songs—the flitting bluebird; For such the scenes the annual 
play brings on. 399 WHILE NOT THE PAST FORGETTING.While not 
the past forgetting, To-day, at least, contention sunk entire—peace, brotherhood 
up- risen; For sign reciprocal our Northern, Southern hands, Lay 
on the graves of all dead soldiers, North or South, 
(Nor for the past alone—for meanings to the future,) Wreaths 
of roses and branches of palm. Publish'd May 30, 1888.
