before, The earth is just as positive and direct as 
it was before, Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as 
real as before, But the soul is also real, it 
too is positive and direct, No reasoning, no proof has 
establish'd it, Undeniable growth has establish'd it. 4These to echo 
the tones of souls and the phrases of souls, (If 
they did not echo the phrases of souls what were 
they then? If they had not reference to you in 
especial what were they then?) I swear I will never 
henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the 
best, I will have to do only with that faith 
that leaves the best untold. Say on, sayers! sing on, 
singers! Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth! Work 
on, age after age, nothing is to be lost, It 
may have to wait long, but it will certainly come 
in use, When the materials are all prepared and ready, 
the architects shall appear. I swear to you the architects 
shall appear without fail, I swear to you they will 
understand you and justify you, The greatest among them shall 
be he who best knows you, and encloses all and 
is faithful to all, He and the rest shall not 
forget you, they shall perceive that you are not an 
iota less than they, You shall be fully glorified in 
them. 180 YOUTH, DAY, OLD AGE AND NIGHT.YOUTH, large, lusty, 
loving—youth full of grace, force, fascination, Do you know that 
Old Age may come after you with equal grace, force, 
fascination? Day full-blown and splendid—day of the immense sun, action, 
ambition, laughter, The Night follows close with millions of suns, 
and sleep and restoring darkness. 181 BIRDS OF PASSAGE. SONG
