you to tell in your own way of the heart 
that is under you, O I do not know what 
you mean there underneath yourselves, you are not happiness, You 
are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn 
and sting me, Yet you are beautiful to me you 
faint tinged roots, you make me think of death, Death 
is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful except 
death and love?) O I think it is not for 
life I am chanting here my chant of lovers, I 
think it must be for death, For how calm, how 
solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers, 
Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines 
to prefer, (I am not sure but the high soul 
of lovers welcomes death most,) Indeed O death, I think 
now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean, 
Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow 
up out of my breast!Spring away from the conceal'd heart 
there! Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots 
timid leaves! Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage 
of my breast! Come I am determin'd to unbare this 
broad breast of mine, I have long enough stifled and 
choked; Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you 
serve me not, I will say what I have to 
say by itself, I will sound myself and comrades only, 
I will never again utter a call only their call, 
I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States, 
I will give an example to lovers to take permanent 
shape and will through the States, Through me shall the 
words be said to make death exhilarating, Give me your 
tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,
