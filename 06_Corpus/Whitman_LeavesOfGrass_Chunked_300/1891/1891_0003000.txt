long since, Language-shapers on other shores, Nations once powerful, now 
reduced, withdrawn, or desolate, I dare not proceed till I 
respectfully credit what you have left wafted hither, I have 
perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,) 
Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve 
more than it deserves, Regarding it all intently a long 
while, then dismissing it, I stand in my place with 
my own day here. Here lands female and male, Here 
the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame 
of materials, Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow'd, The ever-tending, 
the finalè of visible forms, The satisfier, after due long-waiting 
now advancing, Yes here comes my mistress the soul. 6The 
soul, Forever and forever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer 
than water ebbs and flows. I will make the poems 
of materials, for I think they are to be the 
most spiritual poems, And I will make the poems of 
my body and of mortality, For I think I shall 
then supply myself with the poems of my soul and 
of immortality. I will make a song for these States 
that no one State may under any circumstances be subjected 
to another State, And I will make a song that 
there shall be comity by day and by night between 
all the States, and between any two of them, And 
I will make a song for the ears of the 
President, full of weap- ons with menacing points, And behind 
the weapons countless dissatisfied faces; And a song make I 
of the One form'd out of all, The fang'd and 
glittering One whose head is over all, Resolute warlike One 
including and over all, (However high the head of any 
else that head is over all.)I will acknowledge contemporary lands,
