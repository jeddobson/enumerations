see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or 
see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results, 
(But I see the athletes, and I see the results 
of the war glorious and inevitable, and they again leading

is begun, And how the States are complete in themselves—and 
how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves, to 
lead onward, And how these of mine and of the 
States will in their turn be con- vuls'd, and serve 
other parturitions and transitions, And how all people, sights, combinations, 
the democratic masses too, serve—and how every fact, and war 
itself, with all its horrors, serves, And how now or 
at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.

all sights, North, South, East and West, are, Of this 
Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of 
the unnamed lost ever present in my mind; Of the
