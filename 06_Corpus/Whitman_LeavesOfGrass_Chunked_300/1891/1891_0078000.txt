sleepless widow looking out on the winter mid- night, I 
see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid 
earth. A shroud I see and I am the shroud, 
I wrap a body and lie in the coffin, It 
is dark here under ground, it is not evil or 
pain here, it is blank here, for reasons. (It seems 
to me that every thing in the light and air 
ought to be happy, Whoever is not in his coffin 
and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)3I 
see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies 
of the sea, His brown hair lies close and even 
to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he 
urges himself with his legs, I see his white body, 
I see his undaunted eyes, I hate the swift-running eddies 
that would dash him head- fore- most on the rocks. 
What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves? Will you 
kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the 
prime of his middle age? Steady and long he struggles, 
He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his 
strength holds out, The slapping eddies are spotted with his 
blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, 
turn him, His beautiful body is borne in the circling 
eddies, it is continually bruis'd on rocks, Swiftly and out 
of sight is borne the brave corpse. 4I turn but 
do not extricate myself, Confused, a past-reading, another, but with 
darkness yet. The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, 
the wreck-guns sound, The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering 
through the drifts. I look where the ship helplessly heads 
end on, I hear the burst as she strikes, I 
hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.
