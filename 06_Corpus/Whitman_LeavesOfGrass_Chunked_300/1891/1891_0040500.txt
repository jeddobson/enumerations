I walking, these things gathering, On interior rivers by night 
in the glare of pine knots, steamboats wooding up, Sunlight 
by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on 
the valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys 
of the Roanoke and Delaware, In their northerly wilds beasts 
of prey haunting the Adirondacks the hills, or lapping the 
Saginaw waters to drink, In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake 
lost from the flock, sitting on the water rocking silently, 
In farmers' barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor 
done, they rest standing, they are too tired, Afar on 
arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs play 
around, The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd, 
the farthest polar sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes, 
White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest 
dashes, On solid land what is done in cities as 
the bells strike midnight together, In primitive woods the sounds 
there also sounding, the howl of the wolf, the scream 
of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk, 
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, 
in summer visible through the clear waters, the great trout 
swimming, In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas 
the large black buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree 
tops, Below, the red cedar festoon'd with tylandria, the pines 
and cypresses growing out of the white sand that spreads 
far and flat, Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing 
plants, parasites with color'd flowers and berries enveloping huge trees, 
The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, 
noise- lessly waved by the wind, The camp of Georgia 
wagoners just after dark, the supper-fires and the cooking and 
eating by whites and negroes, Thirty or forty great wagons,
