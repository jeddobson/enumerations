starting off you march'd. Pass—then rattle drums again, For an 
army heaves in sight, O another gathering army, Swarming, trailing 
on the rear, O you dread accruing army, O you 
regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your fever, 
O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage

They melt, they disappear. Exult O lands! victorious lands! Not
