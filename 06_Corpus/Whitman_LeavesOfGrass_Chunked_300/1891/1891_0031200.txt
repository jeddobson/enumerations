my likeness, Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric

I DREAM'D IN A DREAM.I DREAM'D in a dream I 
saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole

was seen every hour in the actions of the men 
of that city, And in all their looks and words.

on the pier in the midst of the crowd, parting 
the parting of dear friends, The one to remain hung 
on the other's neck and passionately kiss'd him, While the 
one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in 
his arms. TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST.TO the 
East and to the West, To the man of the 
Seaside State and of Pennsylvania, To the Kanadian of the

to depict you as myself, the germs are in all
