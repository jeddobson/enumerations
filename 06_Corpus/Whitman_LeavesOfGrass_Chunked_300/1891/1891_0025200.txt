same in others, The young man that flushes and flushes, 
and the young woman that flushes and flushes, The young 
man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking 
to repress what would master him, The mystic amorous night, 
the strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats, The pulse pounding through 
palms and trembling encircling fingers, the young man all color'd, 
red, ashamed, angry; The souse upon me of my lover 
the sea, as I lie willing and naked, The merriment 
of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in 
the sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from 
them, The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen'd 
long-round walnuts, The continence of vegetables, birds, animals, The consequent 
meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent, 
while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves 
indecent, The great chastity of paternity, to match the great 
chastity of maternity, The oath of procreation I have sworn, 
my Adamic and fresh daughters, The greed that eats me 
day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate what 
shall produce boys to fill my place when I am 
through, The wholesome relief, repose, content, And this bunch pluck'd 
at random from myself, It has done its workâ€”I toss 
it carelessly to fall where it may. ONE HOUR TO 
MADNESS AND JOY.ONE hour to madness and joy! O furious! 
O confine me not! (What is this that frees me 
so in storms? What do my shouts amid lightnings and 
raging winds mean?)O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than 
any other man! O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath 
them to you my children, I tell them to you, 
for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.) O to be yielded 
to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded
