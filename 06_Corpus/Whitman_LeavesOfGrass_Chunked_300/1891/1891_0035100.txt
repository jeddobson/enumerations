amicable with me. 4The earth expanding right hand and left 
hand, The picture alive, every part in its best light, 
The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping 
where it is not wanted, The cheerful voice of the 
public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road. O 
highway I travel, do you say to me Do not 
leave me? Do you say Venture notâ€”if you leave me 
you are lost? Do you say I am already prepared, 
I am well-beaten and un- denied, adhere to me? O 
public road, I say back I am not afraid to 
leave you, yet I love you, You express me better 
than I can express myself, You shall be more to 
me than my poem. I think heroic deeds were all 
conceiv'd in the open air, and all free poems also, 
I think I could stop here myself and do miracles, 
I think whatever I shall meet on the road I 
shall like, and who- ever beholds me shall like me, 
I think whoever I see must be happy. 5From this 
hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines, 
Going where I list, my own master total and absolute, 
Listening to others, considering well what they say, Pausing, searching, 
receiving, contemplating, Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of 
the holds that would hold me. I inhale great draughts 
of space, The east and the west are mine, and 
the north and the south are mine. I am larger, 
better than I thought, I did not know I held 
so much goodness. All seems beautiful to me, I can 
repeat over to men and women You have done such 
good to me I would do the same to you, 
I will recruit for myself and you as I go,
