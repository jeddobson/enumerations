To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked 
along the shore. O to realize space! The plenteousness of 
all, that there are no bounds, To emerge and be 
of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying 
clouds, as one with them. O the joy of a 
manly self-hood! To be servile to none, to defer to 
none, not to any tyrant known or unknown, To walk 
with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic, To look 
with calm gaze or with a flashing eye, To speak 
with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad 
chest, To confront with your personality all the other personalities 
of the earth. Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth? 
Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word 
and laughing face? Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy 
of the wide-breath'd games? Joy of sweet music, joy of 
the lighted ball-room and the dancers? Joy of the plenteous 
dinner, strong carouse and drinking? Yet O my soul supreme! 
Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought? Joys of the 
free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart? Joys of 
the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering 
and the struggle? The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of 
the solemn musings day or night? Joys of the thought 
of Death, the great spheres Time and Space? Prophetic joys 
of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife, the sweet, 
eternal, perfect comrade? Joys all thine own undying one, joys 
worthy thee O soul. O while I live to be 
the ruler of life, not a slave, To meet life 
as a powerful conqueror, No fumes, no ennui, no more 
complaints or scornful criticisms, To these proud laws of the 
air, the water and the ground, proving my interior soul
