thyself. (Lo, where arise three peerless stars, To be thy 
natal stars my country, Ensemble, Evolution, Freedom, Set in the 
sky of Law.)Land of unprecedented faith, God's faith, Thy soil, 
thy very subsoil, all upheav'd, The general inner earth so 
long so sedulously draped over, now hence for what it 
is boldly laid bare, Open'd by thee to heaven's light 
for benefit or bale. Not for success alone, Not to 
fair-sail unintermitted always, The storm shall dash thy face, the 
murk of war and worse than war shall cover thee 
all over, (Wert capable of war, its tug and trials? 
be capable of peace, its trials, For the tug and 
mortal strain of nations come at last in prosper- ous 
peace, not war;) In many a smiling mask death shall 
approach beguiling thee, thou in disease shalt swelter, The livid 
cancer spread its hideous claws, clinging upon thy breasts, seeking 
to strike thee deep within, Consumption of the worst, moral 
consumption, shall rouge thy face with hectic, But thou shalt 
face thy fortunes, thy diseases, and surmount them all, Whatever 
they are to-day and whatever through time they may be, 
They each and all shall lift and pass away and 
cease from thee, While thou, Time's spirals rounding, out of 
thyself, thyself still extricating, fusing, Equable, natural, mystical Union thou, 
(the mortal with immortal blent,) Shalt soar toward the fulfilment 
of the future, the spirit of the body and the 
mind, The soul, its destinies. The soul, its destinies, the 
real real, (Purport of all these apparitions of the real;) 
In thee America, the soul, its destinies, Thou globe of 
globes! thou wonder nebulous! By many a throe of heat 
and cold convuls'd, (by these thyself solidifying,) Thou mental, moral 
orbâ€”thou New, indeed new, Spiritual World! The Present holds thee
