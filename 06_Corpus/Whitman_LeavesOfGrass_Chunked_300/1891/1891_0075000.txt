plains, I behold enchant- ing mirages of waters and meadows, 
Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines, 
Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel, 
Tying the Eastern to the Western sea, The road between 
Europe and Asia. (Ah Genoese thy dream! thy dream! Centuries 
after thou art laid in thy grave, The shore thou 
foundest verifies thy dream.)4Passage to India! Struggles of many a 
captain, tales of many a sailor dead, Over my mood 
stealing and spreading they come, Like clouds and cloudlets in 
the unreach'd sky. Along all history, down the slopes, As 
a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the 
surface rising, A ceaseless thought, a varied trainâ€”lo, soul, to 
thee, thy sight, they rise, The plans, the voyages again, 
the expeditions; Again Vasco de Gama sails forth, Again the 
knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass, Lands found and nations born, 
thou born America, For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd, 
Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd. 5O vast 
Rondure, swimming in space, Cover'd all over with visible power 
and beauty, Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual 
darkness, Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless 
stars above, Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, 
trees, With inscrutable purpose, some hidden prophetic intention, Now first 
it seems my thought begins to span thee. Down from 
the gardens of Asia descending radiating, Adam and Eve appear, 
then their myriad progeny after them, Wandering, yearning, curious, with 
restless explorations, With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with never-happy hearts, 
With that sad incessant refrain, Wherefore unsatisfied soul? and Whither 
O mocking life? Ah who shall soothe these feverish children? 
Who justify these restless explorations? Who speak the secret of 
impassive earth? Who bind it to us? what is this
