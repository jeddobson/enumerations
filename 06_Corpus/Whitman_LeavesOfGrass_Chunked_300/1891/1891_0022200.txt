the male is perfect, and that of the female is 
perfect. The expression of the face balks account, But the 
expression of a well-made man appears not only in his 
face, It is in his limbs and joints also, it 
is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck,

and resistance, The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over 
and blind- ing the eyes; The march of firemen in 
their own costumes, the play of mascu- line muscle through
