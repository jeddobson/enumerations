Newfoundland, At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with 
the rest and tack- ing, At home on the hills 
of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the 
Texan ranch, Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (lov- 
ing their big proportions,) Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade 
of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and 
meat, A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the 
thoughtfullest, A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons, 
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank 
and religion, A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker, Prisoner, 
fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest. I resist any thing better 
than my own diversity, Breathe the air but leave plenty 
after me, And am not stuck up, and am in 
my place. (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their 
place, The bright suns I see and the dark suns 
I cannot see are in their place, The palpable is 
in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)17These 
are really the thoughts of all men in all ages 
and lands, they are not original with me, If they 
are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, 
or next to nothing, If they are not the riddle 
and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,If they 
are not just as close as they are distant they 
are nothing.This is the grass that grows wherever the land 
is and the water is, This the common air that 
bathes the globe. 18With music strong I come, with my 
cornets and my drums, I play not marches for accepted 
victors only, I play marches for conquer'd and slain persons. 
Have you heard that it was good to gain the 
day? I also say it is good to fall, battles
