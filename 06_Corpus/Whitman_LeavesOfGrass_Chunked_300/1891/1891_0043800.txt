from afar what is already founded, To give it our 
own identity, average, limitless, free, To fill the gross the 
torpid bulk with vital religious fire, Not to repel or 
destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate, To obey as

allow me to say so, I, my friends, if you 
do not, can plainly see her, The same undying soul
