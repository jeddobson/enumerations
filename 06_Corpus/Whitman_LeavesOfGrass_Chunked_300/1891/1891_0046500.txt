who you are, if nobody else owns. Grown, half-grown and 
babe, of this country and every country, in- doors and 
out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see, 
And all else behind or through them. The wife, and 
she is not one jot less than the husband, The

in the daily papers or weekly papers, Or in the 
census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of 
stock. 3The sun and stars that float in the open 
air, The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the
