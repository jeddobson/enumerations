bed, Let the physician and the priest go home. I 
seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will, 
O despairer, here is my neck, By God, you shall 
not go down! hang your whole weight upon me. I 
dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up, Every 
room of the house do I fill with an arm'd 
force, Lovers of me, bafflers of graves. Sleep—I and they 
keep guard all night, Not doubt, not decease shall dare 
to lay finger upon you, I have embraced you, and 
henceforth possess you to myself, And when you rise in 
the morning you will find what I tell you is 
so. 41I am he bringing help for the sick as 
they pant on their backs, And for strong upright men 
I bring yet more needed help. I heard what was 
said of the universe, Heard it and heard it of 
several thousand years; It is middling well as far as 
it goes—but is that all? Magnifying and applying come I, 
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, Taking myself 
the exact dimensions of Jehovah, Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, 
and Hercules his grandson, Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, 
Brahma, Buddha, In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on 
a leaf, the crucifix engraved, With Odin and the hideous-faced 
Mexitli and every idol and image, Taking them all for 
what they are worth and not a cent more, Admitting 
they were alive and did the work of their days, 
(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now 
to rise and fly and sing for themselves,) Accepting the 
rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing 
them freely on each man and woman I see, Discovering 
as much or more in a framer framing a house,
