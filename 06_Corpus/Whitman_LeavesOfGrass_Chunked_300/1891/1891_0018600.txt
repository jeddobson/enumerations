One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and 
talk like a man leaving charges before a journey. Down-hearted 
doubters dull and excluded, Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, 
atheistical, I know every one of you, I know the 
sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief. How the flukes 
splash! How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and 
spouts of blood! Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters

But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, 
and cannot fail. Each who passes is consider'd, each who 
stops is consider'd, not a single one can it fail.

seen again, Nor the old man who has lived without 
purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, Nor 
him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the 
bad dis- order, Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor 
the brutish koboo call'd the ordure of humanity, Nor the 
sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip 
in, Nor any thing in the earth, or down in 
the oldest graves of the earth, Nor any thing in 
the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that 
inhabit them, Nor the present, nor the least wisp that 
is known. 44It is time to explain myselfâ€”let us stand
