bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves, Wood-violets, the little delicate 
pale blossoms called innocence, Samples and sorts not for themselves 
alone, but for their atmos- phere, To grace the bush 
I loveâ€”to sing with the birds, A warble for joy 
of lilac-time, returning in reminiscence. OUTLINES FOR A TOMB.( G. 
P., Buried 1870. )1WHAT may we chant, O thou within 
this tomb? What tablets, outlines, hang for thee, O millionnaire? 
The life thou lived'st we know not, But that thou 
walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts of brokers, 
Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory. 2Silent, my soul, 
With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd, Turning from all the 
samples, monuments of heroes. While through the interior vistas, Noiseless 
uprose, phantasmic, (as by night Auroras of the north,) Lambent 
tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes, Spiritual projections. In one, among the 
city streets a laborer's home appear'd, After his day's work 
done, cleanly, sweet-air'd, the gaslight burning, The carpet swept and 
a fire in the cheerful stove. In one, the sacred 
parturition scene, A happy painless mother birth'd a perfect child. 
In one, at a bounteous morning meal, Sat peaceful parents 
with contented sons. In one, by twos and threes, young 
people, Hundreds concentring, walk'd the paths and streets and roads, 
Toward a tall-domed school. In one a trio beautiful, Grandmother, 
loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat, Chatting and sewing. In 
one, along a suite of noble rooms, 'Mid plenteous books 
and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes, Were groups 
of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old, Reading, conversing. All, 
all the shows of laboring life, City and country, women's, 
men's and children's, Their wants provided for, hued in the 
sun and tinged for once with joy, Marriage, the street, 
the factory, farm, the house-room, lodging- room, Labor and toil,
