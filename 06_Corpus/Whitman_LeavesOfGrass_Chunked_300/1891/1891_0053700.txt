cities, the gliding present, all of these and more are 
in the pageant-procession. Geography, the world, is in it, The 
Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond, 
The coast you henceforth are facing—you Libertad! from your Western 
golden shores, The countries there with their populations, the millions 
en-masse are curiously here, The swarming market-places, the temples with 
idols ranged along the sides or at the end, bonze, 
brahmin, and llama, Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman, The 
singing-girl and the dancing-girl, the ecstatic persons, the secluded emperors, 
Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors, the 
castes, all, Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the 
Altay moun- tains, From Thibet, from the four winding and 
far-flowing rivers of China, From the southern peninsulas and the 
demi-continental islands, from Malaysia, These and whatever belongs to them 
palpable show forth to me, and are seiz'd by me, 
And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by 
them, Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for 
themselves and for you. For I too raising my voice 
join the ranks of this pageant, I am the chanter, 
I chant aloud over the pageant, I chant the world 
on my Western sea, I chant copious the islands beyond, 
thick as stars in the sky, I chant the new 
empire grander than any before, as in a vision it 
comes to me, I chant America the mistress, I chant 
a greater supremacy, I chant projected a thousand blooming cities 
yet in time on those groups of sea-islands, My sail-ships 
and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes, My stars and stripes fluttering 
in the wind, Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having 
done its work, races reborn, refresh'd, Lives, works resumed—the object 
I know not—but the old, the Asiatic renew'd as it
