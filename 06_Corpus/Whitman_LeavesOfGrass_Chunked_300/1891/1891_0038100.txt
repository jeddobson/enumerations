back on me because I look'd forward to them, (The 
time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)5What 
is it then between us? What is the count of 
the scores or hundreds of years between us? Whatever it 
is, it avails notâ€”distance avails not, and place avails not, 
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine, I

laziness, none of these wanting, Was one with the rest, 
the days and haps of the rest, Was call'd by
