the hummock-land or through pleasant openings or dense forests, I 
see the parrots in the woods, I see the papaw-tree 
and the blos- soming titi; Again, sailing in my coaster 
on deck, I coast off Georgia, I coast up the 
Carolinas, I see where the live-oak is growing, I see 
where the yellow-pine, the scented bay-tree, the lemon and orange, 
the cypress, the graceful palmetto, I pass rude sea-headlands and 
enter Pamlico sound through an inlet, and dart my vision

the old woods charged with mistletoe and trailing moss, The 
piney odor and the gloom, the awful natural stillness, (here 
in these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and 
the fugitive has his conceal'd hut;) O the strange fascination 
of these half-known half-impassable swamps, infested by reptiles, resounding with 
the bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the 
night-owl and the wild-cat, and the whirr of the rattlesnake, 
The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon, singing 
through the moon-lit night, The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the 
raccoon, the opossum; A Kentucky corn-field, the tall, graceful, long-leav'd 
corn, slender, flapping, bright green, with tassels, with beautiful ears 
each well-sheath'd in its husk; O my heart! O tender 
and fierce pangs, I can stand them not, I will 
depart; O to be a Virginian where I grew up! 
O to be a Carolinian! O longings irrepressible! O I 
will go back to old Tennessee and never wander more. 
MANNAHATTA.I WAS asking for something specific and perfect for my 
city, Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name. Now I see 
what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane,
