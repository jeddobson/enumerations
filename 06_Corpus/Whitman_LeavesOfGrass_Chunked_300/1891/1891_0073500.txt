mother's, sister's, voices;) The rain, the growing corn, the breeze 
among the long-leav'd corn, The measur'd sea-surf beating on the 
sand, The twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream, The wild-fowl's 
notes at night as flying low migrating north or south, 
The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering 
trees, the open air camp-meeting, The fiddler in the tavern, 
the glee, the long-strung sailor-song, The lowing cattle, bleating sheep,

convent walls a wailing song, Song of lost love, the 
torch of youth and life quench'd in despair, Song of 
the dying swan, Fernando's heart is breaking. Awaking from her 
woes at last retriev'd Amina sings, Copious as stars and 
glad as morning light the torrents of her joy. (The 
teeming lady comes, The lustrious orb, Venus contralto, the blooming 
mother, Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni's self I hear.)4I hear 
those odes, symphonies, operas, I hear in the William Tell 
the music of an arous'd and angry people, I hear
