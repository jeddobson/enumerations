with dwellers? 2Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens, Asia, Africa, 
Europe, are to the eastâ€”America is provided for in the 
west, Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot 
equator, Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends, Within me 
is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings, 
it does not set for months, Stretch'd in due time 
within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon 
and sinks again, Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, 
groups, Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands. 3What 
do you hear Walt Whitman? I hear the workman singing 
and the farmer's wife singing, I hear in the distance 
the sounds of children and of animals early in the 
day, I hear emulous shouts of Australians pursuing the wild 
horse, I hear the Spanish dance with castanets in the 
chestnut shade, to the rebeck and guitar, I hear continual 
echoes from the Thames, I hear fierce French liberty songs, 
I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of 
old poems, I hear the locusts in Syria as they 
strike the grain and grass with the showers of their 
terrible clouds, I hear the Coptic refrain toward sundown, pensively 
falling on the breast of the black venerable vast mother 
the Nile, I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, 
and the bells of the mule, I hear the Arab 
muezzin calling from the top of the mosque, I hear 
the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, I 
hear the responsive base and soprano, I hear the cry 
of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice putting to sea 
at Okotsk, I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle as 
the slaves march on, as the husky gangs pass on 
by twos and threes, fasten'd together with wrist-chains and ankle-chains,
