I hear, A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the 
tops of immense waves, A transparent base shuddering lusciously under 
and through the universe, The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings 
with sweet flutes and violins, all these I fill myself

years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;) O 
to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I 
turn and look at where I cast them, To pass
