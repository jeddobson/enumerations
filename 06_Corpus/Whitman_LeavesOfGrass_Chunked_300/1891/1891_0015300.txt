times and all times, How the skipper saw the crowded 
and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it 
up and down the storm, How he knuckled tight and 
gave not back an inch, and was faith ful of 
days and faithful of nights, And chalk'd in large letters 
on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not 
desert you; How he follow'd with them and tack'd with 
them three days and would not give it up, How 
he saved the drifting company at last, How the lank 
loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the side of their 
prepared graves, How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted 
sick, and the sharp- lipp'd unshaved men; All this I 
swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes 
mine, I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there. 
The disdain and calmness of martyrs, The mother of old, 
condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children

twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the 
mur- derous buckshot and the bullets, All these I feel 
or am. I am the hounded slave, I wince at 
the bite of the dogs, Hell and despair are upon 
me, crack and again crack the marks- men, I clutch 
the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with 
the ooze of my skin, I fall on the weeds 
and stones, The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, 
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the 
head with whip-stocks. Agonies are one of my changes of 
garments, I do not ask the wounded person how he 
feels, I myself become the wounded person, My hurts turn
