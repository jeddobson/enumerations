air, they are in you. Were you thinking that those 
were the words, those delicious sounds out of your friends' 
mouths? No, the real words are more delicious than they. 
Human bodies are words, myriads of words, (In the best 
poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's, well- shaped, natural, 
gay, Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the 
need of shame.) Air, soil, water, fire—those are words, I 
myself am a word with them—my qualities interpenetrate with theirs—my 
name is nothing to them, Though it were told in 
the three thousand languages, what would air, soil, water, fire, 
know of my name? A healthy presence, a friendly or 
commanding gesture, are words, sayings, meanings, The charms that go 
with the mere looks of some men and women, are 
sayings and meanings also. The workmanship of souls is by 
those inaudible words of the earth, The masters know the 
earth's words and use them more than audible words. Amelioration 
is one of the earth's words, The earth neither lags 
nor hastens, It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in 
itself from the jump, It is not half beautiful only, 
defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show. 
The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough, The 
truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so 
conceal'd either,They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print, They are 
imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly, Conveying a sentiment 
and invitation, I utter and utter, I speak not, yet 
if you hear me not of what avail am I 
to you? To bear, to better, lacking these of what 
avail am I? (Accouche! accouchez! Will you rot your own 
fruit in yourself there? Will you squat and stifle there?)The 
earth does not argue, Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
