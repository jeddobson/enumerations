unruly, musical, self-sufficient, I see that the word of my 
city is that word from of old, Because I see 
that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb, Rich, hemm'd 
thick all around with sailships and steamships, an island sixteen 
miles long, solid-founded, Numberless crowded streets, high growths of iron, 
slender, strong, light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies, Tides swift 
and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown, The flowing sea-currents, 
the little islands, larger adjoining islands, the heights, the villas,

women, the shops and shows, A million people—manners free and 
superb—open voices— hospitality—the most courageous and friendly young men, City 
of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts! 
City nested in bays! my city! ALL IS TRUTH.O ME, 
man of slack faith so long, Standing aloof, denying portions 
so long, Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth, Discovering 
to-day there is no lie or form of lie, and 
can be none, but grows as inevitably upon itself as 
the truth does upon itself, Or as any law of 
the earth or any natural production of the earth does.
