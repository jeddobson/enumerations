all the rest. 398 THE UNITED STATES TO OLD WORLD 
CRITICS.Here first the duties of to-day, the lessons of the 
concrete, Wealth, order, travel, shelter, products, plenty; As of the 
building of some varied, vast, perpetual edifice, Whence to arise 
inevitable in time, the towering roofs, the lamps, The solid-planted

procession retrospective, Thanks—joyful thanks!—a soldier's, traveler's thanks. 398 LIFE AND 
DEATH.The two old, simple problems ever intertwined, Close home, elusive, 
present, baffled, grappled. By each successive age insoluble, pass'd on,
