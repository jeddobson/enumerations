ALONE.Not meagre, latent boughs alone, O songs! (scaly and bare, 
like eagles' talons,) But haply for some sunny day (who 
knows?) some future spring, some summer—bursting forth, To verdant leaves, 
or sheltering shade—to nourishing fruit, Apples and grapes—the stalwart limbs 
of trees emerging—the fresh, free, open air, And love and 
faith, like scented roses blooming. 402 THE DEAD EMPEROR.To-day, with 
bending head and eyes, thou, too, Columbia, Less for the

From ups and downs—with intervals—from elder years, mid-age, or youth,) 
"In Cabin'd Ships," or "Thee Old Cause" or "Poets to 
Come" Or "Paumanok," "Song of Myself," "Calamus," or "Adam," Or 
"Beat! Beat! Drums!" or "To the Leaven'd Soil they Trod," 
Or "Captain! My Captain!" "Kosmos," "Quicksand Years," or "Thoughts," "Thou
