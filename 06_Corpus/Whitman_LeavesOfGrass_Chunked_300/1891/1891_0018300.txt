bring; This printed and bound book—but the printer and the 
printing- office boy? The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend 
close and solid in your arms? The black ship mail'd 
with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets— but the 
pluck of the captain and engineers? In the houses the 
dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and 
the look out of their eyes? The sky up there—yet 
here or next door, or across the way? The saints 
and sages in history—but you yourself? Sermons, creeds, theology—but the 
fathomless human brain, And what is reason? and what is 
love? and what is life? 43I do not despise you 
priests, all time, the world over, My faith is the 
greatest of faiths and the least of faiths, Enclosing worship 
ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern, Believing 
I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand 
years, Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the 
sun, Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, 
powowing with sticks in the circle of obis, Helping the 
llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the 
idols, Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, 
rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,Drinking mead from 
the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran, 
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and 
knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, Accepting the Gospels, accepting him 
that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, To 
the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting 
patiently in a pew, Ranting and frothing in my insane 
crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me, Looking 
forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and 
land, Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
