me and never the usual terms. Neither a servant nor 
a master I, I take no sooner a large price 
than a small price, I will have my own whoever 
enjoys me, I will be even with you and you 
shall be even with me. If you stand at work 
in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest 
in the same shop, If you bestow gifts on your 
brother or dearest friend I demand as good as your 
brother or dearest friend, If your lover, husband, wife, is 
welcome by day or night, I must be personally as 
welcome, If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become 
so for your sake, If you remember your foolish and 
outlaw'd deeds, do you think I cannot remember my own 
foolish and outlaw'd deeds? If you carouse at the table 
I carouse at the opposite side of the table, If 
you meet some stranger in the streets and love him 
or her, why I often meet strangers in the street 
and love them. Why what have you thought of yourself? 
Is it you then that thought yourself less? Is it 
you that thought the President greater than you? Or the 
rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than 
you? (Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once 
drunk, or a thief, Or that you are diseas'd, or 
rheumatic, or a prostitute, Or from frivolity or impotence, or 
that you are no scholar and never saw your name 
in print, Do you give in that you are any 
less immortal?)2Souls of men and women! it is not you 
I call unseen, unheard, untouchable and untouching, It is not 
you I go argue pro and con about, and to 
settle whether you are alive or no, I own publicly
