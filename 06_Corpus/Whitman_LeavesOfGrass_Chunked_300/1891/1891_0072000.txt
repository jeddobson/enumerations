the days, the clouds dispel'd, The travail o'er, the long-sought 
extrication, When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world, (In 
gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours 
Columbia,) Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star, In 
heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever, Shall beam immortal. 
THE OX-TAMER.IN a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral 
region, Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, 
a famous tamer of oxen, There they bring him the 
three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to break them, He will take 
the wildest steer in the world and break him and 
tame him, He will go fearless without any whip where 
the young bullock chafes up and down the yard, The 
bullock's head tosses restless high in the air with raging 
eyes, Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides—how soon 
this tamer tames him; See you! on the farms hereabout 
a hundred oxen young and old, and he is the 
man who has tamed them, They all know him, all 
are affectionate to him; See you! some are such beautiful 
animals, so lofty looking; Some are buff-color'd, some mottled, one 
has a white line running along his back, some are 
brindled, Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)—see you! 
the bright hides, See, the two with stars on their 
foreheads—see, the round bodies and broad backs, How straight and 
square they stand on their legs—what fine sagacious eyes! How 
they watch their tamer—they wish him near them—how they turn 
to look after him! What yearning expression! how uneasy they 
are when he moves away from them; Now I marvel 
what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics, 
poems, depart—all else departs,) I confess I envy only his 
fascination—my silent, illiterate friend, Whom a hundred oxen love there
