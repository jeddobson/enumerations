hither come, ended the strata of her former themes, Hidden 
and cover'd by to-day's, foundation of to-day's, Ended, deceas'd through 
time, her voice by Castaly's fountain, Silent the broken-lipp'd Sphynx 
in Egypt, silent all those century- baffling tombs, Ended for 
aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors, ended the 
primitive call of the muses, Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, 
Melpomene, Thalia dead, Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and 
Oriana, ended the quest of the holy Graal, Jerusalem a 
handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct, The Crusaders' 
streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise, Amadis,

purple page, And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme. I 
say I see, my friends, if you do not, the 
illustrious emigré, (having it is true in her day, although 
the same, changed, journey'd considerable,) Making directly for this rendezvous, 
vigorously clearing a path for herself, striding through the confusion, 
By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd, Bluff'd not 
a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers, Smiling and pleas'd 
with palpable intent to stay, She's here, install'd amid the 
kitchen ware! 4But hold—don't I forget my manners? To introduce 
the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to chant 
for?) to thee Columbia; In liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp
