God, and in my own face in the glass, I 
find letters from God dropt in the street, and every 
one is sign'd by God's name, And I leave them 
where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go, 
Others will punctually come for ever and ever. 49And as 
to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it 
is idle to try to alarm me. To his work 
without flinching the accoucheur comes, I see the elder-hand pressing 
receiving supporting, I recline by the sills of the exquisite 
flexible doors, And mark the outlet, and mark the relief 
and escape. And as to you Corpse I think you 
are good manure, but that does not offend me, I 
smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, I reach to 
the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of 
melons. And as to you Life I reckon you are 
the leavings of many deaths, (No doubt I have died 
myself ten thousand times before.)I hear you whispering there O 
stars of heaven, O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers 
and pro- motions, If you do not say any thing 
how can I say any thing? Of the turbid pool 
that lies in the autumn forest, Of the moon that 
descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, Toss, sparkles of 
day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in 
the muck, Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry 
limbs. I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the 
night, I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams 
reflected, And debouch to the steady and central from the 
offspring great or small. 50There is that in me—I do 
not know what it is—but I know it is in 
me. Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,
