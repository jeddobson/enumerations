or Florida's glades, Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the 
wide blue spread of Huron, With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, 
or Yosemite, And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the 
rustling sea- sound, That endlessly sounds from the two Great 
Seas of the world. And for thy subtler sense subtler 
refrains dread Mother, Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, 
mind-formulas fitted for thee, real and sane and large as 
these and thee, Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we 
knew, thou transcendental Union! By thee fact to be justified, 
blended with thought, Thought of man justified, blended with God, 
Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality! Through thy reality, 
lo, the immortal idea! 3Brain of the New World, what 
a task is thine, To formulate the Modern—out of the 
peerless grandeur of the modern, Out of thyself, comprising science, 
to recast poems, churches, art, (Recast, may-be discard them, end 
them—may-be their work is done, who knows?) By vision, hand, 
conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead, 
To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present. And 
yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the 
Old World brain, Thou that lay folded like an unborn 
babe within its folds so long, Thou carefully prepared by 
it so long—haply thou but unfoldest it, only maturest it, 
It to eventuate in thee—the essence of the by-gone time 
contain'd in thee, Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, 
destined with reference to thee; Thou but the apples, long, 
long, long a-growing, The fruit of all the Old ripening 
to-day in thee. 4Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy, 
Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only, 
The Past is also stored in thee, Thou holdest not 
the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western continent
