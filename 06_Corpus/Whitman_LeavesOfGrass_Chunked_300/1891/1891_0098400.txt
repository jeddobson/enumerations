the globe was circling round and round,—and now returns: How 
changed the place—all the old land-marks gone—the parents dead; (Yes, 
he comes back to lay in port for good—to settle— 
has a well- fill'd purse—no spot will do but this;) 
The little boat that scull'd him from the sloop, now 
held in leash I see, I hear the slapping waves, 
the restless keel, the rocking in the sand, I see 
the sailor kit, the canvas bag, the great box bound 
with brass, I scan the face all berry-brown and bearded—the 
stout-strong frame, Dress'd in its russet suit of good Scotch 
cloth: (Then what the told-out story of those twenty years? 
What of the future?) 401 ORANGE BUDS BY MAIL FROM 
FLORIDA.[Voltaire closed a famous argument by claiming that a ship 
of war and the grand opera were proofs enough of 
civilization's and France's progress, in his day.]A lesser proof than 
old Voltaire's, yet greater, Proof of this present time, and 
thee, thy broad expanse, America, To my plain Northern hut, 
in outside clouds and snow, Brought safely for a thousand 
miles o'er land and tide, Some three days since on 
their own soil live-sprouting, Now here their sweetness through my 
room unfolding, A bunch of orange buds by mail from 
Florida. 401 TWILIGHT.The soft voluptuous opiate shades, The sun just 
gone, the eager light dispell'd—(I too will soon be gone, 
dispell'd,) A haze—nirwana—rest and night—oblivion. 402 YOU LINGERING SPARSE LEAVES 
OF ME.You lingering sparse leaves of me on winter-nearing boughs, 
And I some well-shorn tree of field or orchard-row; You 
tokens diminute and lorn—(not now the flush of May, or 
July clover-bloom—no grain of August now;) You pallid banner-staves—you pennants 
valueless—you over- stay'd of time, Yet my soul-dearest leaves confirming 
all the rest, The faithfulest—hardiest—last. 402 NOT MEAGRE, LATENT BOUGHS
