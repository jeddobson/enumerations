see beyond is futile, I do not advise you to

woman and child convince, When the minted gold in the 
vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter, When warrantee deeds loafe 
in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions, I intend 
to reach them my hand, and make as much of 
them as I do of men and women like you.

rolling earth, and of words according, Were you thinking that 
those were the words, those upright lines? those curves, angles, 
dots? No, those are not the words, the substantial words 
are in the ground and sea, They are in the
