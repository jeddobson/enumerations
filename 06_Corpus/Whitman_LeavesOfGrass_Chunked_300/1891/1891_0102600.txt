DIVINE COMPLETE."[Sunday,–– – ––.–Went this forenoon to church. A college 
professor, Rev. Dr.——, gave us a fine sermon, during which 
I caught the above words; but the minister included in 
his "rounded catalogue" letter and spirit, only the esthetic things, 
and entirely ignored what I name in the following:]The devilish 
and the dark, the dying and diseas'd, The countless (nineteen-twentieths) 
low and evil, crude and savage, The crazed, prisoners in 
jail, the horrible, rank, malignant, Venom and filth, serpents, the 
ravenous sharks, liars, the disso- lute; (What is the part 
the wicked and the loathesome bear within earth's orbic scheme?) 
Newts, crawling things in slime and mud, poisons, The barren 
soil, the evil men, the slag and hideous rot. 420 
MIRAGES. ( Noted verbatim after a supper-talk out doors in 
Nevada with two old miners. )MORE experiences and sights, stranger, 
than you'd think for; Times again, now mostly just after 
sunrise or before sunset, Sometimes in spring, oftener in autumn, 
perfectly clear weather, in plain sight, Camps far or near, 
the crowded streets of cities and the shop- fronts, (Account 
for it or not—credit or not—it is all true, And 
my mate there could tell you the like—we have often 
con- fab'd about it,) People and scenes, animals, trees, colors 
and lines, plain as could be, Farms and dooryards of 
home, paths border'd with box, lilacs in corners, Weddings in 
churches, thanksgiving dinners, returns of long- absent sons, Glum funerals, 
the crape-veil'd mother and the daughters, Trials in courts, jury 
and judge, the accused in the box, Contestants, battles, crowds, 
bridges, wharves, Now and then mark'd faces of sorrow or 
joy, (I could pick them out this moment if I 
saw them again,) Show'd to me just aloft to the 
right in the sky-edge, Or plainly there to the left
