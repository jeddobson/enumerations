in the forehead, wide between the ears, Limbs glossy and 
supple, tail dusting the ground, Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, 
ears finely cut, flexibly moving. His nostrils dilate as my

sleeps by the bayou, Where the black bear is searching 
for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud 
with his paddle-shaped tail; Over the growing sugar, over the 
yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist
