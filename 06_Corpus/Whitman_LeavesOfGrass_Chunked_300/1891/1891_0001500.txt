for upon the earth, (appearing at inter- vals,) How dear 
and dreadful they are to the earth, How they inure 
to themselves as much as to anyâ€”what a paradox appears 
their age, How people respond to them, yet know them 
not, How there is something relentless in their fate all 
times, How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation 
and re- ward, And how the same inexorable price must 
still be paid for the same great purchase. TO THE 
STATES.TO the States or any one of them, or any 
city of the States, Resist much, obey little, Once unquestioning 
obedience, once fully enslaved, Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, 
city of this earth, ever after- ward resumes its liberty. 
ON JOURNEYS THROUGH THE STATES.ON journeys through the States we 
start, (Ay through the world, urged by these songs, Sailing 
henceforth to every land, to every sea,) We willing learners 
of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all. We 
have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on, And 
have said, Why should not a man or woman do 
as much as the seasons, and effuse as much? We 
dwell a while in every city and town, We pass 
through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the Mississippi, 
and the Southern States, We confer on equal terms with 
each of the States, We make trial of ourselves and 
invite men and women to hear, We say to ourselves, 
Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body and the 
soul, Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, 
chaste, mag- netic, And what you effuse may then return 
as the seasons return, And may be just as much 
as the seasons. TO A CERTAIN CANTATRICE.HERE, take this gift,
