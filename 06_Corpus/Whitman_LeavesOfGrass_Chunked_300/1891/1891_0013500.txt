plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach, In 
vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones, In 
vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes, In 
vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters 
lying low, In vain the buzzard houses herself with the

the whole earth. So they show their relations to me

they evince them plainly in their possession. I wonder where 
they get those tokens, Did I pass that way huge

and now and forever, Gathering and showing more always and 
with velocity, Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these 
among them, Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my 
remembrancers, Picking out here one that I love, and now 
go with him on brotherly terms. A gigantic beauty of 
a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses, Head high
