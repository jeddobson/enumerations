woman! She looks out from her quaker cap, her face 
is clearer and more beautiful than the sky. She sits 
in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse, 
The sun just shines on her old white head. Her 
ample gown is of cream-hued linen, Her grandsons raised the 
flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with the distaff and 
the wheel. The melodious character of the earth, The finish 
beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to 
go, The justified mother of men. THE MYSTIC TRUMPETER.1HARK, some 
wild trumpeter, some strange musician, Hovering unseen in air, vibrates 
capricious tunes to-night. I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I 
catch thy notes, Now pouring, whirling like a tempest round 
me, Now low, subdued, now in the distance lost. 2Come 
nearer bodiless one, haply in thee resounds Some dead composer, 
haply thy pensive life Was fill'd with aspirations high, unform'd 
ideals, Waves, oceans musical, chaotically surging, That now ecstatic ghost, 
close to me bending, thy cornet echoing, pealing, Gives out 
to no one's ears but mine, but freely gives to 
mine, That I may thee translate. 3Blow trumpeter free and 
clear, I follow thee, While at thy liquid prelude, glad, 
serene, The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of 
day withdraw, A holy calm descends like dew upon me, 
I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise, 
I scent the grass, the moist air and the roses; 
Thy song expands my numb'd imbonded spirit, thou freest, launchest 
me, Floating and basking upon heaven's lake. 4Blow again trumpeter! 
and for my sensuous eyes, Bring the old pageants, show 
the feudal world. What charm thy music works! thou makest 
pass before me, Ladies and cavaliers long dead, barons are 
in their castle halls, the troubadours are singing, Arm'd knights
