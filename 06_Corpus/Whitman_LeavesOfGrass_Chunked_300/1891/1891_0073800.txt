Meyerbeer's Huguenots, the Prophet, or Robert, Gounod's Faust, or Mozart's 
Don Juan. I hear the dance-music of all nations, The 
waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss, The 
bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets. I see religious 
dances old and new, I hear the sound of the 
Hebrew lyre, I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross 
on high, to the martial clang of cymbals, I hear 
dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic shouts, as they spin 
around turning always towards Mecca, I see the rapt religious 
dances of the Persians and the Arabs, Again, at Eleusis,

of flageolets throwing and catching their weapons, As they fall 
on their knees and rise again. I hear from the 
Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling, I see the worshippers within, 
nor form nor sermon, argument nor word, But silent, strange, 
devout, rais'd, glowing heads, ecstatic faces. I hear the Egyptian 
harp of many strings, The primitive chants of the Nile 
boatmen, The sacred imperial hymns of China, To the delicate 
sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone,) Or 
to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina, 
A band of bayaderes. 5Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe 
seizing inflates me, To organs huge and bands I hear 
as from vast concourses of voices, Luther's strong hymn, Eine 
feste Burg ist unser Gott, Rossini's Stabat Mater dolorosa, Or 
floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color'd windows, 
The passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis. Composers! mighty
