ages that men and women like us grew up and 
travel'd their course and pass'd on, What vast-built cities, what 
orderly republics, what pastoral tribes and nomads, What histories, rulers, 
heroes, perhaps transcending all others, What laws, customs, wealth, arts, 
traditions, What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and 
phrenology, What of liberty and slavery among them, what they 
thought of death and the soul, Who were witty and 
wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and undevelop'd, Not 
a mark, not a record remainsâ€”and yet all remains. O 
I know that those men and women were not for 
nothing, any more than we are for nothing, I know 
that they belong to the scheme of the world every 
bit as much as we now belong to it. Afar 
they stand, yet near to me they stand, Some with 
oval countenances learn'd and calm, Some naked and savage, some 
like huge collections of insects, Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, 
tribes, horsemen, Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on 
farms, laboring, reaping, filling barns, Some traversing paved avenues, amid 
temples, palaces, factories, libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments. Are 
those billions of men really gone? Are those women of 
the old experience of the earth gone? Do their lives, 
cities, arts, rest only with us? Did they achieve nothing 
for good for themselves? I believe of all those men 
and women that fill'd the unnamed lands, every one exists 
this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us, In exact 
proportion to what he or she grew from in life, 
and out of what he or she did, felt, became, 
loved, sinn'd, in life. I believe that was not the 
end of those nations or any person of them, any 
more than this shall be the end of my nation,
