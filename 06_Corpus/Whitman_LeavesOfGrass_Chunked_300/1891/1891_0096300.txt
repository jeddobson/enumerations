OF THAT BLITHE THROAT OF THINE.[More than eighty-three degrees north—about 
a good day's steaming distance to the Pole by one 
of our fast oceaners in clear water—Greely the explorer heard 
thesong of a single snow-bird merrily sounding over the desolation.]Of 
that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank, 
I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird—let me too welcome chilling 
drifts, E'en the profoundest chill, as now—a torpid pulse, a 
brain un- nerv'd, Old age land-lock'd within its winter bay—(cold, 
cold, O cold!) These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my 
frozen feet, For them thy faith, thy rule I take, 
and grave it to the last; Not summer's zones alone—not 
chants of youth, or south's warm tides alone, But held 
by sluggish floes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus 
of years, These with gay heart I also sing. 394 
BROADWAY.What hurrying human tides, or day or night! What passions, 
winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters! What whirls of evil, 
bliss and sorrow, stem thee! What curious questioning glances—glints of 
love! Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration! Thou portal—thou arena—thou 
of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups! (Could but thy 
flagstones, curbs, façades, tell their inimitable tales; Thy windows rich, 
and huge hotels—thy side-walks wide;) Thou of the endless sliding, 
mincing, shuffling feet! Thou, like the parti-colored world itself—like infinite, 
teeming, mocking life! Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson! 
394 TO GET THE FINAL LILT OF SONGS.To get the 
final lilt of songs, To penetrate the inmost lore of 
poets—to know the mighty ones, Job, Homer, Eschylus, Dante, Shakspere, 
Tennyson, Emerson; To diagnose the shifting-delicate tints of love and 
pride and doubt—to truly understand, To encompass these, the last 
keen faculty and entrance-price, Old age, and what it brings 
from all its past experiences. 395 OLD SALT KOSSABONE.Far back,
