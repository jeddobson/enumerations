more than India! O secret of the earth and sky! 
Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks 
and rivers! Of you O woods and fields! of you 
strong mountains of my land! Of you O prairies! of 
you gray rocks! O morning red! O clouds! O rain 
and snows! O day and night, passage to you! O 
sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter! 
Passage to you! Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in 
my veins! Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor! Cut

not grovel'd here long enough, eating and drinking like mere 
brutes? Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books 
long enough? Sail forth—steer for the deep waters only, Reckless 
O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me, 
For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared 
to go, And we will risk the ship, ourselves and 
all. O my brave soul! O farther farther sail! O 
daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas 
of God? O farther, farther, farther sail! 323 PRAYER OF

rebellious brows, twelve dreary months, Sore, stiff with many toils, 
sicken'd and nigh to death, I take my way along 
the island's edge, Venting a heavy heart. I am too 
full of woe! Haply I may not live another day; 
I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink 
or sleep, Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once 
more to Thee, Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, 
commune with Thee, Report myself once more to Thee. Thou
