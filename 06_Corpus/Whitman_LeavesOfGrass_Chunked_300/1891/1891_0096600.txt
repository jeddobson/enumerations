related on my mother's side, Old Salt Kossabone, I'll tell 
you how he died: (Had been a sailor all his 
life—was nearly 90—lived with his married grandchild, Jenny; House on 
a hill, with view of bay at hand, and distant 
cape, and stretch to open sea;) The last of afternoons, 
the evening hours, for many a year his regular custom, 
In his great arm chair by the window seated, (Sometimes,

call, Ernani's, sweet Gennaro's, I fold thenceforth, or seek to 
fold, within my chants transmuting, Freedom's and Love's and Faith's 
unloos'd cantabile, (As perfume's, color's, sunlight's correlation:) From these, for 
these, with these, a hurried line, dead tenor, A wafted 
autumn leaf, dropt in the closing grave, the shovel'd earth, 
To memory of thee. 396 CONTINUITIES.[From a talk I had
