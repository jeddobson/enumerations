the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of 
the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long, 
The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced 
are to go on in their turns, and the far 
behind are to come on in their turns, The diverse 
shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and 
unite â€”they unite now. 8The sleepers are very beautiful as 
they lie unclothed, They flow hand in hand over the 
whole earth from east to west as they lie unclothed, 
The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European 
and American are hand in hand, Learn'd and unlearn'd are 
hand in hand, and male and female are hand in 
hand, The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare 
breast of her lover, they press close without lust, his 
lips press her neck, The father holds his grown or 
ungrown son in his arms with meas- ureless love, and 
the son holds the father in his arms with measureless 
love, The white hair of the mother shines on the 
white wrist of the daughter, The breath of the boy 
goes with the breath of the man, friend is inarm'd 
by friend, The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher 
kisses the scholar, the wrong'd is made right, The call 
of the slave is one with the master's call, and 
the master salutes the slave, The felon steps forth from 
the prison, the insane becomes sane, the suffering of sick 
persons is reliev'd, The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat 
that was unsound is sound, the lungs of the consumptive 
are resumed, the poor distress'd head is free, The joints 
of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother 
than ever, Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,
