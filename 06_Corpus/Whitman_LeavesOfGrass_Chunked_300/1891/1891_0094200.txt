head to foot, Delicious, enough. Enough O deed impromptu and 
secret, Enough O gliding present—enough O summ'd-up past. Dear friend 
whoever you are take this kiss, I give it especially 
to you, do not forget me, I feel like one 
who has done work for the day to retire awhile, 
I receive now again of my many translations, from my
