alone, Earth's résumé entire floats on thy keel O ship, 
is steadied by thy spars, With thee Time voyages in 
trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim with thee, With 
all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou bear'st 
the other continents, Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the 
destination-port triumphant; Steer then with good strong hand and wary

light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire 
globe, But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly 
to comprehend thee, I but thee name, thee prophesy, as 
now, I merely thee ejaculate! Thee in thy future, Thee
