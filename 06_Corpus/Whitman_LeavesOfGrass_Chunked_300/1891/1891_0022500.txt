clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, The slow return from the fire, 
the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the 
listening on the alert, The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the 
bent head, the curv'd neck and the counting; Such-like I 
loveâ€”I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's breast 
with the little child, Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with 
wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, 
count. 3I knew a man, a common farmer, the father 
of five sons, And in them the fathers of sons, 
and in them the fathers of sons. This man was 
of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, The shape of 
his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair 
and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the 
richness and breadth of his manners, These I used to 
go and visit him to see, he was wise also, 
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years 
old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, They 
and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved 
him, They did not love him by allowance, they loved 
him with personal love, He drank water only, the blood 
show'd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, 
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his 
boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him 
by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by 
men that loved him, When he went with his five 
sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would 
pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of 
the gang, You would wish long and long to be 
with him, you would wish to sit by him in 
the boat that you and he might touch each other.
