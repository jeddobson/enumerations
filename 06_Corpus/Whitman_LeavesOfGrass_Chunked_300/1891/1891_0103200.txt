than they. 421 UNSEEN BUDS.UNSEEN buds, infinite, hidden well, Under 
the snow and ice, under the darkness, in every square 
or cubic inch, Germinal, exquisite, in delicate lace, microscopic, unborn, 
Like babes in wombs, latent, folded, compact, sleeping; Billions of 
billions, and trillions of trillions of them waiting, (On earth 
and in the sea—the universe—the stars there in the heavens,) 
Urging slowly, surely forward, forming endless, And waiting ever more, 
forever more behind. GOOD-BYE MY FANCY! GOOD-BYE my Fancy! Farewell 
dear mate, dear love! I'm going away, I know not 
where, Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever 
see you again, So Good-bye my Fancy. Now for my 
last—let me look back a moment; The slower fainter ticking 
of the clock is in me, Exit, nightfall, and soon 
the heart-thud stopping. Long have we lived, joy'd, caress'd together; 
Delightful!—now separation—Good-bye my Fancy. Yet let me not be too 
hasty, Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really 
blended into one; Then if we die we die together, 
(yes, we'll remain one,) If we go anywhere we'll go 
together to meet what happens, May-be we'll be better off 
and blither, and learn something, May-be it is yourself now 
really ushering me to the true songs, (who knows?) May-be 
it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning—so now 
finally, Good-bye—and hail! my Fancy.
