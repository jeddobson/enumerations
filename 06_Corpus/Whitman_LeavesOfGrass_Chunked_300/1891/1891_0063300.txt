of the depths the storm's abysmic waves, who knows whence? 
Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and 
tatter'd sail.)Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, 
I bring, A windrow-drift of weeds and shells. O little 
shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless, Will you not 
little shells to the tympans of temples held, Murmurs and 
echoes still call up, eternity's music faint and far, Wafted 
inland, sent from Atlantica's rim, strains for the soul of 
the prairies, Whisper'd reverberations, chords for the ear of the 
West joyously sounding, Your tidings old, yet ever new and 
untranslatable, Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life, 
(For not my life and years alone I give—all, all 
I give,) These waifs from the deep, cast high and 
dry, Wash'd on America's shores? THE RETURN OF THE HEROES.1FOR 
the lands and for these passionate days and for myself, 
Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn 
fields, Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee, Answering 
the pulses of thy sane and equable heart, Tuning a 
verse for thee. O earth that hast no voice, confide 
to me a voice, O harvest of my lands—O boundless 
summer growths, O lavish brown parturient earth—O infinite teeming womb, 
A song to narrate thee. 2Ever upon this stage, Is 
acted God's calm annual drama, Gorgeous processions, songs of birds, 
Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul, The 
heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong 
waves, The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees, 
The liliput countless armies of the grass, The heat, the 
showers, the measureless pasturages, The scenery of the snows, the 
winds' free orchestra, The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the 
clear cerulean and the silvery fringes, The high dilating stars,
