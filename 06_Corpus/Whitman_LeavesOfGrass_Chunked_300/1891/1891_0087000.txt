instrument thou playest, Thou melt'st my heart, my brain—thou movest, 
drawest, chan- gest them at will; And now thy sullen 
notes send darkness through me, Thou takest away all cheering 
light, all hope, I see the enslaved, the overthrown, the 
hurt, the opprest of the whole earth, I feel the

purged—nothing but joy left! The ocean fill'd with joy—the atmosphere 
all joy! Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in 
the ecstasy of life! Enough to merely be! enough to 
breathe! Joy! joy! all over joy! TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN 
WINTER.THEE for my recitative, Thee in the driving storm even 
as now, the snow, the winter-day declining, Thee in thy 
panoply, thy measur'd dual throbbing and thy beat convulsive, Thy 
black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel, Thy ponderous 
side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating, shuttling at thy sides, 
Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar, now tapering in
