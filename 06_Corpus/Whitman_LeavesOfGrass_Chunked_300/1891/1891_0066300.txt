stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)The battle 
rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and 
retreat, The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs, The prison, 
scaffold, garroté, handcuffs, iron necklace and lead- balls do their 
work, The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres, 
The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick 
in distant lands, The cause is asleep, the strongest throats 
are choked with their own blood, The young men droop 
their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet; But for 
all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, 
nor the infidel enter'd into full possession. When liberty goes 
out of a place it is not the first to 
go, nor the second or third to go, It waits 
for all the rest to go, it is the last. 
When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs, 
And when all life and all the souls of men 
and women are dis- charged from any part of the 
earth, Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty 
be discharged from that part of the earth, And the 
infidel come into full possession. Then courage European revolter, revoltress! 
For till all ceases neither must you cease. I do 
not know what you are for, (I do not know 
what I am for myself, nor what any thing is 
for,) But I will search carefully for it even in 
being foil'd, In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment—for they too are 
great. Did we think victory great? So it is—but now 
it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that 
defeat is great, And that death and dismay are great.
