hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I watch'd, 
I stood very near you old man when cool and 
indifferent, but trembling with age and your unheal'd wounds you 
mounted the scaffold;) I would sing in my copious song

Year of comets and meteors transient and strange—lo! even here 
one equally transient and strange! As I flit through you
