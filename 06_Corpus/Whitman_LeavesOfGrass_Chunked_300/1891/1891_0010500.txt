were time lost listening to me. I do not snivel 
that snivel the world over, That months are vacuums and 
the ground but wallow and filth. Whimpering and truckling fold 
with powders for invalids, con- formity goes to the fourth-remov'd, 
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.

own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years, 
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness 
I can wait. My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in
