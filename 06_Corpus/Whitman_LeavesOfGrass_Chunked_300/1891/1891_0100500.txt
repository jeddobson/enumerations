seem'd to resort in unusual numbers. Especially at the beginning 
of the day, and again at the ending, I was 
sure to get there the most copious bird-concerts. I repair'd 
there frequently at sunrise—and also at sunset, or just before 
. . . Once the question arose in me: Which 
is the best singing, the first or the lattermost? The 
first always exhilerated, and perhaps seem'd more joyous and stronger; 
but I always felt the sunset or late afternoon sounds 
more penetrating and sweeter—seem'd to touch the soul—often the evening 
thrushes, two or three of them, responding and perhaps blending. 
Though I miss'd some of the mornings, I found myself 
getting to be quite strictly punctual at the evening utterances. 
ANOTHER NOTE.—"He went out with the tide and the sunset," 
was a phrase I heard from a surgeon describing an 
old sailor's death under peculiarly gentle conditions. During the Secession 
War, 1863 and '4, visiting the Army Hospitals around Washington, 
I form'd the habit, and continued it to the end, 
whenever the ebb or flood tide began the latter part 
of day, of punctually visiting those at that time populous 
wards of suffering men. Somehow (or I thought it so) 
the effect of the hour was palpable. The badly wounded 
would get some ease, and would like to talk a 
little, or be talk'd to. Intellectual and emotional natures would 
be at their best: Deaths were always easier; medicines seem'd 
to have better effect when given then, and a lulling 
atmosphere would pervade the wards. Similar influences, similar circumstances and 
hours, day-close, after great battles, even with all their horrors. 
I had more than once the same experience on the 
fields cover'd with fallen or dead. 412 TO THE PENDING 
YEAR.HAVE I no weapon-word for thee—some message brief and fierce?
