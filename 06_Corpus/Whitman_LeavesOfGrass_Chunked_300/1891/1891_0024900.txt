once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like 
me, are our lusty lurking masculine poems,) Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, 
love-yielding, love-climbers, and the climbing sap, Arms and hands of

The vex'd corrosion so pensive and so painful, The torment, 
the irritable tide that will not be at rest, The 
like of the same I feel, the like of the
