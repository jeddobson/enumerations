Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls, the keepers round, 
Plenteous, well-armed, watching with vigilant eyes,) Calmly a lady walk'd 
holding a little innocent child by either hand, Whom seating 
on their stools beside her on the platform, She, first 
preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude, In 
voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn. A 
soul confined by bars and bands, Cries, help! O help! 
and wrings her hands, Blinded her eyes, bleeding her breast,

hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute, With deep 
half-stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow'd and moved 
to weeping, And youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home, The 
mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy childhood, 
The long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence; A wondrous minute then—but
