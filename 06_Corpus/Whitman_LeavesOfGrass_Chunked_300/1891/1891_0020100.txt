sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on 
the banjo, Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted 
with small-pox over all latherers, And those well-tann'd to those 
that keep out of the sun. I teach straying from 
me, yet who can stray from me? I follow you 
whoever you are from the present hour, My words itch 
at your ears till you understand them. I do not 
say these things for a dollar or to fill up 
the time while I wait for a boat, (It is 
you talking just as much as myself, I act as 
the tongue of you, Tied in your mouth, in mine 
it begins to be loosen'd.)I swear I will never again 
mention love or death inside a house, And I swear 
I will never translate myself at all, only to him 
or her who privately stays with me in the open 
air. If you would understand me go to the heights 
or water-shore, The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a 
drop or motion of waves a key, The maul, the 
oar, the hand-saw, second my words. No shutter'd room or 
school can commune with me, But roughs and little children 
better than they. The young mechanic is closest to me, 
he knows me well, The woodman that takes his axe 
and jug with him shall take me with him all 
day, The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at 
the sound of my voice, In vessels that sail my 
words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love 
them. The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine, 
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, 
and I do not fail them, On that solemn night 
(it may be their last) those that know me seek
