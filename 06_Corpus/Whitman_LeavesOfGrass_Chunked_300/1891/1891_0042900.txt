the bloody foam. O the old manhood of me, my 
noblest joy of all! My children and grand-children, my white 
hair and beard, My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the 
long stretch of my life. O ripen'd joy of womanhood! 
O happiness at last! I am more than eighty years 
of age, I am the most venerable mother, How clear 
is my mind—how all people draw nigh to me! What 
attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more than 
the bloom of youth? What beauty is this that descends 
upon me and rises out of me? O the orator's 
joys! To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of 
the voice out from the ribs and throat, To make 
the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself, To lead 
America—to quell America with a great tongue. O the joy 
of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity through 
materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them, My 
soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, 
touch, reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,The real life 
of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh, 
My body done with materials, my sight done with my 
material eyes, Proved to me this day beyond cavil that 
it is not my material eyes which finally see, Nor 
my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, 
procreates. O the farmer's joys! Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's, 
Kan- sian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys! To rise at peep of 
day and pass forth nimbly to work, To plough land 
in the fall for winter-sown crops, To plough land in 
the spring for maize, To train orchards, to graft the 
trees, to gather apples in the fall. O to bathe 
in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,
