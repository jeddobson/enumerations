lately with a German spiritualist.]Nothing is ever really lost, or 
can be lost, No birth, identity, form—no object of the 
world. Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing; Appearance 
must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain. Ample 
are time and space—ample the fields of Nature. The body, 
sluggish, aged, cold—the embers left from earlier fires, The light 
in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again; The 
sun now low in the west rises for mornings and

to the future:) Yonnondio! Yonnondio!—unlimn'd they disappear; To-day gives place, 
and fades—the cities, farms, factories fade; A muffled sonorous sound, 
a wailing word is borne through the air for a 
moment, Then blank and gone and still, and utterly lost. 
396 LIFE.Ever the undiscouraged, resolute, struggling soul of man; (Have 
former armies fail'd? then we send fresh armies—and fresh again;) 
Ever the grappled mystery of all earth's ages old or 
new; Ever the eager eyes, hurrahs, the welcome-clapping hands, the 
loud applause; Ever the soul dissatisfied, curious, unconvinced at last;
