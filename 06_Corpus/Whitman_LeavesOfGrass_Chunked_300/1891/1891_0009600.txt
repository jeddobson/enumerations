round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe, 
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees, 
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or 
through those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of 
the Arkansas, Torches shine in the dark that hangs on 
the Chattahooche or Altamahaw, Patriarchs sit at supper with sons 
and grandsons and great-grand- sons around them, In walls of 
adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their 
day's sport, The city sleeps and the country sleeps, The 
living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their 
time, The old husband sleeps by his wife and the 
young husband sleeps by his wife; And these tend inward 
to me, and I tend outward to them, And such 
as it is to be of these more or less 
I am, And of these one and all I weave 
the song of myself. 16I am of old and young, 
of the foolish as much as the wise, Regardless of 
others, ever regardful of others, Maternal as well as paternal, 
a child as well as a man, Stuff'd with the 
stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff that 
is fine, One of the Nation of many nations, the 
smallest the same and the largest the same, A Southerner 
soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down 
by the Oconee I live, A Yankee bound my own 
way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on 
earth and the sternest joints on earth, A Kentuckian walking 
the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a 
Louisianian or Georgian, A boatman over lakes or bays or 
along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye; At home on Kanadian 
snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off
