head slues round on my neck, Music rolls, but not 
from the organ, Folks are around me, but they are 
no household of mine. Ever the hard unsunk ground, Ever 
the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, 
ever the air and the ceaseless tides, Ever myself and 
my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real, Ever the old inexplicable query, 
ever that thorn'd thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts, 
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the 
sly one hides and bring him forth, Ever love, ever 
the sobbing liquid of life, Ever the bandage under the 
chin, ever the trestles of death. Here and there with 
dimes on the eyes walking, To feed the greed of 
the belly the brains liberally spooning, Tickets buying, taking, selling, 
but in to the feast never once going. Many sweating, 
ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for pay- ment receiving, 
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming. 
This is the city and I am one of the 
citizens, Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, 
newspapers, schools, The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, 
stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate. The little plentiful 
manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd coats, I am 
aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or 
fleas,) I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and 
shallowest is deathless with me, What I do and say 
the same waits for them, Every thought that flounders in 
me the same flounders in them. I know perfectly well 
my own egotism, Know my omnivorous lines and must not 
write any less, And would fetch you whoever you are 
flush with myself. Not words of routine this song of 
mine, But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer
