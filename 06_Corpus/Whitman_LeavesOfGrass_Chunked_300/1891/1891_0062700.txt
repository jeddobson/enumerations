see if I am not as majestic as they, I 
will see if I am not as subtle and real 
as they, I will see if I am to be 
less generous than they, I will see if I have 
no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning, I 
will see if the fishes and birds are to be 
enough for themselves, and I am not to be enough 
for myself. I match my spirit against yours you orbs, 
growths, mountains, brutes, Copious as you are I absorb you 
all in myself, and become the master myself, America isolated 
yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself? These 
States, what are they except myself? I know now why 
the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my 
sake, I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, 
rude forms. (Mother, bend down, bend close to me your 
face, I know not what these plots and wars and 
deferments are for, I know not fruition's success, but I 
know that through war and crime your work goes on, 
and must yet go on.)19Thus by blue Ontario's shore, While 
the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward 
me, I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm 
of my theme was upon me, Till the tissues that 
held me parted their ties upon me. And I saw 
the free souls of poets, The loftiest bards of past 
ages strode before me, Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, 
were disclosed to me. 20O my rapt verse, my call, 
mock me not! Not for the bards of the past, 
not to invoke them have I launch'd you forth, Not 
to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores, 
Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.
