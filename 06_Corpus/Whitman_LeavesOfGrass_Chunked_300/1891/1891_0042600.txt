the rude high roof, the ample and shadow'd space, The 
furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running. O to 
resume the joys of the soldier! To feel the presence 
of a brave commanding officer—to feel his sympathy! To behold 
his calmness—to be warm'd in the rays of his smile! 
To go to battle—to hear the bugles play and the 
drums beat! To hear the crash of artillery—to see the 
glittering of the bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun! To 
see men fall and die and not complain! To taste 
the savage taste of blood—to be so devilish! To gloat 
so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy. O 
the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again! 
I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the 
Atlantic breezes fan- ning me, I hear the cry again 
sent down from the mast-head, There—she blows! Again I spring 
up the rigging to look with the rest—we descend, wild 
with excitement, I leap in the lower'd boat, we row 
toward our prey where he lies, We approach stealthy and 
silent, I see the mountainous mass, lethargic, basking, I see 
the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from 
his vigorous arm; O swift again far out in the 
ocean the wounded whale, settling, running to windward, tows me, 
Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close 
again, I see a lance driven through his side, press'd 
deep, turn'd in the wound, Again we back off, I 
see him settle again, the life is leaving him fast, 
As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim 
in circles narrower and narrower, swiftly cutting the water—I see 
him die, He gives one convulsive leap in the centre 
of the circle, and then falls flat and still in
