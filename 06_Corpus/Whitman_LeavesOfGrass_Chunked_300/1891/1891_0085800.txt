to be, cringing for it, Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what 
lets it wrig to its hole. This face is a 
dog's snout sniffing for garbage, Snakes nest in that mouth, 
I hear the sibilant threat. This face is a haze 
more chill than the arctic sea, Its sleepy and wabbling 
icebergs crunch as they go. This is a face of

The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen 
tenement, And I shall look again in a score or 
two of ages, And I shall meet the real landlord 
perfect and unharm'd, every inch as good as myself. 4The
