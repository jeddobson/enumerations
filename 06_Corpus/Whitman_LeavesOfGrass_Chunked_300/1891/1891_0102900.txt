or demarcate, or pick out evils from their formid- able 
masses (even to expose them,) But add, fuse, complete, extend—and 
celebrate the immortal and the good. Haughty this song, its 
words and scope, To span vast realms of space and 
time, Evolution—the cumulative—growths and generations. Begun in ripen'd youth and 
steadily pursued, Wandering, peering, dallying with all—war, peace, day and

And grand their laws, so multiform, puzzling, evolutionary; But grander 
far the unseen soul of me, comprehending, endow- ing all 
those, Lighting the light, the sky and stars, delving the 
earth, sailing the sea, (What were all those, indeed, without
