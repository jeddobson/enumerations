people made of wood and stone? Or that there be 
no justice in destiny or time? O Liberty! O mate 
for me! Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the 
axe, in reserve, to fetch them out in case of 
need, Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd, 
Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic, Here
