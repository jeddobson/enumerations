and the voices of children and women, The many-moving sea-tides, 
and I saw the ships how they sail'd, And the 
summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with 
labor, And the infinite separate houses, how they all went 
on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, 
And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities 
pent —lo, then and there, Falling upon them all and 
among them all, enveloping me with the rest, Appear'd the 
cloud, appear'd the long black trail, And I knew death, 
its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. Then with 
the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, 
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of 
me, And I in the middle as with companions, and 
as holding the hands of companions, I fled forth to 
the hiding receiving night that talks not, Down to the 
shores of the water, the path by the swamp in 
the dimness, To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines 
so still. And the singer so shy to the rest 
receiv'd me, The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades 
three, And he sang the carol of death, and a 
verse for him I love. From deep secluded recesses, From 
the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, Came 
the carol of the bird. And the charm of the 
carol rapt me, As I held as if by their 
hands my comrades in the night, And the voice of 
my spirit tallied the song of the bird. Come lovely 
and soothing death,Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,In the 
day, in the night, to all, to each,Sooner or later 
delicate death.Prais'd be the fathomless universe,For life and joy, and 
for objects and knowledge curious,And for love, sweet love—but praise!
