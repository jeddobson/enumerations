in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path; Down in 
Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving mules or oxen 
before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks and wharves; 
Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with 
equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride; In arriere 
the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the calumet, the 
pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorse- ment, The sachem blowing

air in the centre of the room, darting athwart, up 
and down, casting swift shadows in specks on the opposite 
wall where the shine is; The athletic American matron speaking 
in public to crowds of listeners, Males, females, immigrants, combinations,
