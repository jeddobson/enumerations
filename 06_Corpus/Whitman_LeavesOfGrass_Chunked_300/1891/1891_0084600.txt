in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd mind, 
thy soaring spirit, Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, 
ablaze, swift-moving, fructifying all, Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and 
joy, in endless great hilarity, Scattering for good the cloud 
that hung so long, that weigh'd so long upon the 
mind of man, The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain 
decadence of man; Thee in thy larger, saner brood of 
female, male—thee in thy athletes, moral, spiritual, South, North, West,

all-enclosing worship—thee in no single bible, saviour, merely, Thy saviours

thy democratic fêtes en-masse, thy high original festivals, operas, lecturers, 
preachers, Thee in thy ultimata, (the preparations only now completed, 
the edifice on sure foundations tied,) Thee in thy pinnacles, 
intellect, thought, thy topmost rational joys, thy love and godlike 
aspiration, In thy resplendent coming literati, thy full-lung'd orators, thy 
sacerdotal bards, kosmic savans, These! these in thee, (certain to 
come,) to-day I prophesy. 6Land tolerating all, accepting all, not 
for the good alone, all good for thee, Land in 
the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself, 
Under the rule of God to be a rule unto
