course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kana- da's woods, O'er all 
the globe that turns its face to thee shining in 
space, Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas, 
Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers 
givest so liberally, Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, 
with but a fleeting ray out of thy million millions, 
Strike through these chants. Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle 
and thy strength for these, Prepare the later afternoon of 
me myself—prepare my lengthen- ing shadows, Prepare my starry nights. 
FACES.1SAUNTERING the pavement or riding the country by-road, lo, such 
faces! Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality, The spiritual-prescient 
face, the always welcome common benevo- lent face, The face 
of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural 
law- yers and judges broad at the back-top, The faces 
of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved 
blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens, The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning 
artist's face, The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the 
handsome detested or despised face, The sacred faces of infants, 
the illuminated face of the mother of many children, The 
face of an amour, the face of veneration, The face 
as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock, 
The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated 
face, A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper, 
A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and 
knife of the gelder. Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing 
the ceaseless ferry, faces and faces and faces, I see 
them and complain not, and am content with all. 2Do 
you suppose I could be content with all if I 
thought them their own finalè? This now is too lamentable 
a face for a man, Some abject louse asking leave
