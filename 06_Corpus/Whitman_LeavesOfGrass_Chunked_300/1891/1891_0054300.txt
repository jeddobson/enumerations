of the same come limping, Some appear wooden-legged, and some 
appear bandaged and bloodless. Why this is indeed a show—it 
has called the dead out of the earth! The old 
graveyards of the hills have hurried to see! Phantoms! phantoms 
countless by flank and rear! Cock'd hats of mothy mould—crutches 
made of mist! Arms in slings—old men leaning on young 
men's shoulders. What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all 
this chattering of bare gums? Does the ague convulse your 
limbs? do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level 
them? If you blind your eyes with tears you will 
not see the President's marshal, If you groan such groans 
you might balk the government cannon. For shame old maniacs—bring 
down those toss'd arms, and let your white hair be, 
Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them 
from the windows, See how well dress'd, see how orderly 
they conduct themselves. Worse and worse—can't you stand it? are 
you retreating? Is this hour with the living too dead 
for you? Retreat then—pell-mell! To your graves—back—back to the hills 
old limpers! I do not think you belong here anyhow. 
But there is one thing that belongs here—shall I tell 
you what it is, gentlemen of Boston? I will whisper 
it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to 
England, They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go 
with a cart to the royal vault, Dig out King 
George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave- clothes, box 
up his bones for a journey, Find a swift Yankee 
clipper—here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper, Up with your 
anchor—shake out your sails—steer straight toward Boston bay. Now call 
for the President's marshal again, bring out the govern- ment 
cannon, Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession,
