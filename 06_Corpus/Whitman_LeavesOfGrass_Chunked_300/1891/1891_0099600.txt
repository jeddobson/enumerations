chirps—lingering-dying ones probably (undoubtedly)—which now I may as well gather 
and put in fair type while able to see correctly—(for 
my eyes plainly warn me they are dimming, and my 
brain more and more palpably neglects or refuses, month after 
month, even slight tasks or revisions.) In fact, here I 
am these current years 1890 and '91, (each successive fortnight 
getting stiffer and stuck deeper) much like some hard-cased dilapidated
