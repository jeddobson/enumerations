pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen, How the ash writhes 
under those muscular arms! There by the furnace, and there 
by the anvil, Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges, 
Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous

upon thy splinter'd staff, Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's 
breast with desperate hands, Savagely struggled for, for life or
