one—as sailing in a ship? *Navesink—a sea-side mountain, lower entrance 
of New York Bay. LAST OF EBB, AND DAYLIGHT WANING.Last 
of ebb, and daylight waning, Scented sea-cool landward making, smells 
of sedge and salt incoming, With many a half-caught voice 
sent up from the eddies, Many a muffled confession—many a 
sob and whisper'd word, As of speakers far or hid. 
How they sweep down and out! how they mutter! Poets 
unnamed—artists greatest of any, with cherish'd lost designs, Love's unresponse—a 
chorus of age's complaints—hope's last words, Some suicide's despairing cry,

lives, gaily the outward bound, gaily the inward bound, Flaunting 
from many a spar the flag I love. BY THAT 
LONG SCAN OF WAVES.By that long scan of waves, myself 
call'd back, resumed upon myself, In every crest some undulating 
light or shade—some retrospect, Joys, travels, studies, silent panoramas—scenes ephemeral, 
The long past war, the battles, hospital sights, the wounded 
and the dead, Myself through every by-gone phase—my idle youth—old
