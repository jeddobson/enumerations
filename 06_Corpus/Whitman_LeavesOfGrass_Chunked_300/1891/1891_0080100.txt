workmen, Each after his kind. Cold dash of waves at 
the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river, half-frozen mud 
in the streets, A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short 
last daylight of December, A hearse and stages, the funeral 
of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers. Steady
