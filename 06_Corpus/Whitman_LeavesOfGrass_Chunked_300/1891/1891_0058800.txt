sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this 
for his dear sake, Lilac and star and bird twined 
with the chant of my soul, There in the fragrant 
pines and the cedars dusk and dim. O CAPTAIN! MY 
CAPTAIN!O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The 
ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is 
won, The port is near, the bells I hear, the 
people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the 
vessel grim and daring; But O heart! heart! heart! O 
the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my 
Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. O Captain! my Captain! 
rise up and hear the bells; Rise up—for you the 
flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, For you bouquets 
and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, For you they 
call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! 
dear father! This arm beneath your head! It is some 
dream that on the deck, You've fallen cold and dead. 
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and 
still, My father does not feel my arm, he has 
no pulse nor will, The ship is anchor'd safe and 
sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the 
victor ship comes in with object won; Exult O shores, 
and ring O bells! But I with mournful tread, Walk 
the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. HUSH'D 
BE THE CAMPS TO-DAY.( May 4, 1865. )HUSH'D be the 
camps to-day, And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons, 
And each with musing soul retire to celebrate, Our dear 
commander's death. No more for him life's stormy conflicts, Nor 
victory, nor defeat—no more time's dark events, Charging like ceaseless 
clouds across the sky. But sing poet in our name,
