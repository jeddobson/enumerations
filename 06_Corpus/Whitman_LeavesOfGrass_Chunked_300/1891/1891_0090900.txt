all lands; What whispers are these O lands, running ahead 
of you, passing under the seas? Are all nations communing? 
is there going to be but one heart to the 
globe? Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns 
grow dim, The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps

squads of twos or threes or single ones they come, 
And silently gather round me. Now sound no note O

spirited horses, With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by 
their thighs, (ah my brave horsemen! My handsome tan-faced horsemen! 
what life, what joy and pride, With all the perils 
were yours.)Nor you drummers, neither at reveill√© at dawn, Nor 
the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled
