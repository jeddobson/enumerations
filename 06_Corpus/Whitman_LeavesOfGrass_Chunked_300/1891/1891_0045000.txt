return that show of blacken'd, mutilated corpses! That hell unpent 
and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for 
lop- tongued wolves, not reasoning men, And in its stead 
speed industry's campaigns, With thy undaunted armies, engineering, Thy pennants 
labor, loosen'd to the breeze, Thy bugles sounding loud and 
clear. Away with old romance! Away with novels, plots and 
plays of foreign courts, Away with love-verses sugar'd in rhyme, 
the intrigues, amours of idlers, Fitted for only banquets of 
the night where dancers to late music slide, The unhealthy 
pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few, With perfumes, heat and 
wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers. To you ye reverent sane 
sisters, I raise a voice for far superber themes for 
poets and for art, To exalt the present and the 
real, To teach the average man the glory of his 
daily walk and trade, To sing in songs how exercise 
and chemical life are never to be baffled, To manual 
work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig, To 
plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers, For 
every man to see to it that he really do 
something, for every woman too; To use the hammer and 
the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,) To cultivate a turn for 
carpentering, plastering, painting, To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, 
porter, To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the 
washing, cook- ing, cleaning, And hold it no disgrace to 
take a hand at them themselves. I say I bring 
thee Muse to-day and here, All occupations, duties broad and 
close, Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation, The 
old, old practical burdens, interests, joys, The family, parentage, childhood, 
husband and wife, The house-comforts, the house itself and all 
its belongings, Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,
