worthy to meet me, And I charge you that you 
be patient and perfect till I come. Till then I 
salute you with a significant look that you do not 
forget me. I WAS LOOKING A LONG WHILE.I WAS looking 
a long while for Intentions, For a clew to the 
history of the past for myself, and for these chants—and 
now I have found it, It is not in those 
paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither accept nor 
reject,) It is no more in the legends than in 
all else, It is in the present—it is this earth 
to-day, It is in Democracy—(the purport and aim of all 
the past,) It is the life of one man or 
one woman to-day—the average man of to-day, It is in 
languages, social customs, literatures, arts, It is in the broad 
show of artificial things, ships, machinery, poli- tics, creeds, modern 
improvements, and the interchange of nations, All for the modern—all 
for the average man of to-day. THOUGHT.OF persons arrived at 
high positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholar- ships, and the like; (To 
me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away 
from them, except as it results to their bodies and 
souls, So that often to me they appear gaunt and 
naked, And often to me each one mocks the others, 
and mocks himself or herself, And of each one the 
core of life, namely happiness, is full of the rotten 
excrement of maggots, And often to me those men and 
women pass unwittingly the true realities of life, and go 
toward false realities, And often to me they are alive 
after what custom has served them, but nothing more, And 
often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walk- 
ing the dusk.) MIRACLES.WHY, who makes much of a miracle?
