be with no one else so well as they love 
to be with me, By day to work with me, 
and by night to sleep with me. Another time in 
warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots 
where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the 
buoys,) O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the

the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers, The ships 
sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft and the raftsmen

the stream of smoke when they cook supper at evening. 
(O something pernicious and dread! Something far away from a

Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)O to work 
in mines, or forging iron, Foundry casting, the foundry itself,
