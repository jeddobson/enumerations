yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet, Shall mediate to 
the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them, God and 
eid贸lons. And thee my soul, Joys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations, Thy 
yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet, Thy mates, 
eid贸lons. Thy body permanent, The body lurking there within thy 
body, The only purport of the form thou art, the 
real I myself, An image, an eid贸lon. Thy very songs 
not in thy songs, No special strains to sing, none 
for itself, But from the whole resulting, rising at last 
and floating, A round full-orb'd eid贸lon. FOR HIM I SING.FOR 
him I sing, I raise the present on the past, 
(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present 
on the past,) With time and space I him dilate 
and fuse the immortal laws, To make himself by them 
the law unto himself. WHEN I READ THE BOOK.WHEN I 
read the book, the biography famous, And is this then 
(said I) what the author calls a man's life? And

of my life, Why even I myself I often think 
know little or nothing of my real life, Only a 
few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections I 
seek for my own use to trace out here.) BEGINNING 
MY STUDIES.BEGINNING my studies the first step pleas'd me so 
much, The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of 
motion, The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love, 
The first step I say awed me and pleas'd me 
so much, I have hardly gone and hardly wish'd to 
go any farther, But stop and loiter all the time 
to sing it in ecstatic songs. BEGINNERS.HOW they are provided
