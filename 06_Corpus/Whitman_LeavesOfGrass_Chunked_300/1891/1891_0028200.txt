out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off 
a live-oak in Florida as it hung trailing down, Here, 
some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage, 
And here what I now draw from the water, wading 
in the pond- side, (O here I last saw him 
that tenderly loves me, and returns again never to separate 
from me, And this, O this shall henceforth be the 
token of comrades, this calamus-root shall, Interchange it youths with 
each other! let none render it back!) And twigs of 
maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut, And 
stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar, These 
I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits, Wandering, 
point to or touch as I pass, or throw them 
loosely from me, Indicating to each one what he shall 
have, giving something to each; But what I drew from 
the water by the pond-side, that I reserve, I will 
give of it, but only to them that love as 
I myself am capable of loving. NOT HEAVING FROM MY 
RIBB'D BREAST ONLY.NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only, Not 
in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself, Not 
in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs, Not in many an oath 
and promise broken, Not in my wilful and savage soul's 
volition, Not in the subtle nourishment of the air, Not 
in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists, 
Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will 
one day cease, Not in many a hungry wish told 
to the skies only, Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown 
from me when alone far in the wilds, Not in 
husky pantings through clinch'd teeth, Not in sounded and resounded 
words, chattering words, echoes, dead words, Not in the murmurs
