the placid beckoning stars, The moving flocks and herds, the 
plains and emerald meadows, The shows of all the varied 
lands and all the growths and products. 3Fecund America—to-day, Thou

With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and 
your muskets; How elate I stood and watch'd you, where
