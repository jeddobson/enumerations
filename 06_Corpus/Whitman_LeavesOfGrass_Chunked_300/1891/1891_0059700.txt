all hazards, Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true 
use of precedents, Does not repel them or the past 
or what they have produced under their forms, Takes the 
lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the 
house, Perceives that it waits a little while in the 
door, that it was fittest for its days, That its 
life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who

Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity, the 
soul loves. 6Land of lands and bards to corroborate! Of

Built of the common stock, having room for far and 
near, Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land, 
Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its 
neck with incomparable love, Plunging his seminal muscle into its 
merits and demerits, Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, 
vocal in him, Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in 
him, Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia, Niagara, 
Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him, If the Atlantic coast 
stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretch- ing with 
them North or South, Spanning between them East and West,
