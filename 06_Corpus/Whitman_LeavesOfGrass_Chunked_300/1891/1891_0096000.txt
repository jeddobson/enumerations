out through wrath, fears, dark dismays, and many a long 
suspense; All past—and since, in countless graves receding, mellowing, Victor's 
and vanquish'd—Lincoln's and Lee's—now thou with them, Man of the 
mighty days—and equal to the days! Thou from the prairies!—tangled 
and many-vein'd and hard has been thy part, To admiration 
has it been enacted! 393 RED JACKET (FROM ALOFT.)[Impromptu on 
Buffalo City's monument to, and re-burial of the old Iroquois 
orator, October 9, 1884.]Upon this scene, this show, Yielded to-day 
by fashion, learning, wealth, (Nor in caprice alone—some grains of 
deepest meaning,) Haply, aloft, (who knows?) from distant sky-clouds' blended 
shapes, As some old tree, or rock or cliff, thrill'd 
with its soul, Product of Nature's sun, stars, earth direct—a 
towering human form, In hunting-shirt of film, arm'd with the 
rifle, a half-ironical smile curving its phantom lips, Like one 
of Ossian's ghosts looks down. 393 WASHINGTON'S MONUMENT, FEBRUARY, 1885.Ah, 
not this marble, dead and cold: Far from its base 
and shaft expanding—the round zones circling, comprehending, Thou, Washington, art 
all the world's, the continents' entire— not yours alone, America, 
Europe's as well, in every part, castle of lord or 
laborer's cot, Or frozen North, or sultry South—the African's—the Arab's 
in his tent, Old Asia's there with venerable smile, seated 
amid her ruins; (Greets the antique the hero new? 'tis 
but the same—the heir legitimate, continued ever, The indomitable heart 
and arm—proofs of the never-broken line, Courage, alertness, patience, faith, 
the same—e'en in defeat de- feated not, the same:) Wherever 
sails a ship, or house is built on land, or 
day or night, Through teeming cities' streets, indoors or out, 
factories or farms, Now, or to come, or past—where patriot 
wills existed or exist, Wherever Freedom, pois'd by Toleration, sway'd 
by Law, Stands or is rising thy true monument. 394
