apparition of the sky, From our countenances, mine and yours, 
faithfully returning them, Every day in public appearing without fail, 
but never twice with the same companions. Embracing man, embracing 
all, proceed the three hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the 
sun; Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and 
sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they. 
Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading, Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever 
withstanding, passing, carrying, The soul's realization and determination still inheriting, 
The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing, 
No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking, 
Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing, Of all able and 
ready at any time to give strict account, The divine 
ship sails the divine sea. 2Whoever you are! motion and 
reflection are especially for you, The divine ship sails the 
divine sea for you. Whoever you are! you are he 
or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid, 
You are he or she for whom the sun and 
moon hang in the sky, For none more than you 
are the present and the past, For none more than 
you is immortality. Each man to himself and each woman 
to herself, is the word of the past and present, 
and the true word of immortality; No one can acquire 
for another—not one, Not one can grow for another—not one. 
The song is to the singer, and comes back most 
to him, The teaching is to the teacher, and comes 
back most to him, The murder is to the murderer, 
and comes back most to him, The theft is to 
the thief, and comes back most to him, The love 
is to the lover, and comes back most to him, 
The gift is to the giver, and comes back most
