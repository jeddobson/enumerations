is life, Here is what has come to the surface 
after so many throes and convulsions. How curious! how real! 
Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun. See revolving the 
globe, The ancestor-continents away group'd together, The present and future 
continents north and south, with the isthmus between. See, vast 
trackless spaces, As in a dream they change, they swiftly 
fill, Countless masses debouch upon them, They are now cover'd 
with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known. See, projected through 
time, For me an audience interminable. With firm and regular 
step they wend, they never stop, Successions of men, Americanos, 
a hundred millions, One generation playing its part and passing 
on, Another generation playing its part and passing on in 
its turn, With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me 
to listen, With eyes retrospective towards me. 3Americanos! conquerors! marches 
humanitarian! Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses! For you a programme 
of chants. Chants of the prairies, Chants of the long-running 
Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea, Chants of Ohio, 
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, Chants going forth from 
the centre from Kansas, and thence equi- distant, Shooting in 
pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all. 4Take my leaves 
America, take them South and take them North, Make welcome 
for them everywhere, for they are your own off- spring, 
Surround them East and West, for they would surround you, 
And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect 
lovingly with you. I conn'd old times, I sat studying 
at the feet of the great masters, Now if eligible 
O that the great masters might return and study me. 
In the name of these States shall I scorn the 
antique? Why these are the children of the antique to 
justify it. 5Dead poets, philosophs, priests, Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments
