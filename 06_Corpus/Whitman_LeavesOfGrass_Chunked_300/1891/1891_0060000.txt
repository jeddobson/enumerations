and touching whatever is between them, Growths growing from him 
to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, 
chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia, Tangles as tangled in him 
as any canebrake or swamp, He likening sides and peaks 
of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent ice, Off him 
pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie, Through him 
flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish- hawk, mocking-bird, 
night-heron, and eagle, His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed 
to good and evil, Surrounding the essences of real things, 
old times and present times, Surrounding just found shores, islands, 
tribes of red aborigines, Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature 
and muscle, The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, 
peace, the formation of the Constitution, The separate States, the 
simple elastic scheme, the immigrants, The Union always swarming with 
blatherers and always sure and impregnable, The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, 
clearings, wild animals, hunt- ers, trappers, Surrounding the multiform agriculture, 
mines, temperature, the gestation of new States, Congress convening every 
Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts, 
Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, espe- cially 
the young men, Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the 
gait they have of persons who never knew how it 
felt to stand in the presence of superiors, The freshness 
and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of 
their phrenology, The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness 
when wrong'd, The fluency of their speech, their delight in 
music, their curiosity, good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite 
make, The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness, The 
perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid 
move- ment of the population, The superior marine, free commerce, 
fisheries, whaling, gold-dig- ging, Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines
