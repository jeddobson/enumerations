these broad majestic days of peace, (For the war, the 
struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific Ideal, Against vast 
odds erewhile having gloriously won, Now thou stridest on, yet

slave on the face of the earth, The rapt promises 
and luminè of seers, the spiritual world, these centuries-lasting songs, 
And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid 
announce- ments of any. A CLEAR MIDNIGHT.THIS is thy hour

Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou 
lovest best, Night, sleep, death and the stars. 370 SONGS
