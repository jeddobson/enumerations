by subtle analogies all other theories, The theory of a 
city, a poem, and of the large politics of these 
States; Who believes not only in our globe with its 
sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns 
and moons, Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, 
not for a day but for all time, sees races,

river, also the western prairie-scent, And exudes it all again. 
WHO LEARNS MY LESSON COMPLETE?WHO learns my lesson complete? Boss, 
journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist, The stupid and the wise 
thinker, parents and offspring, merchant, clerk, porter and customer, Editor,

salaams. I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things 
and the reasons of things, They are so beautiful I 
nudge myself to listen. I cannot say to any person 
what I hear—I cannot say it to myself —it is 
very wonderful. It is no small matter, this round and 
delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit for ever 
and ever, without one jolt or the untruth of a 
single second, I do not think it was made in 
six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten billions
