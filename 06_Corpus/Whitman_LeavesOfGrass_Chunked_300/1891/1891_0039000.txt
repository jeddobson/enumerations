for me, and your body for you, be hung out 
divinest aromas, Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample 
and sufficient rivers, Expand, being than which none else is 
perhaps more spiritual, Keep your places, objects than which none 
else is more lasting. You have waited, you always wait, 
you dumb, beautiful ministers, We receive you with free sense 
at last, and are insatiate hence- forward, Not you any 
more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves 
from us, We use you, and do not cast you 
aside—we plant you perma- nently within us, We fathom you 
not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, You furnish 
your parts toward eternity, Great or small, you furnish your 
parts toward the soul. 134 SONG OF THE ANSWERER.1NOW list 
to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the 
Answerer, To the cities and farms I sing as they 
spread in the sunshine before me. A young man comes 
to me bearing a message from his brother, How shall 
the young man know the whether and when of his 
brother? Tell him to send me the signs. And I 
stand before the young man face to face, and take 
his right hand in my left hand and his left 
hand in my right hand, And I answer for his 
brother and for men, and I answer for him that 
answers for all, and send these signs. Him all wait 
for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive 
and final, Him they accept, in him lave, in him 
perceive themselves as amid light, Him they immerse and he 
immerses them. Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, 
people, animals, The profound earth and its attributes and the 
unquiet ocean, (so tell I my morning's romanza,) All enjoyments
