separate Nature so unnatural? What is this earth to our 
affections? (unloving earth, without a throb to answer ours, Cold 
earth, the place of graves.)Yet soul be sure the first 
intent remains, and shall be carried out, Perhaps even now 
the time has arrived. After the seas are all cross'd, 
(as they seem already cross'd,) After the great captains and 
engineers have accomplish'd their work, After the noble inventors, after 
the scientists, the chemist, the geologist, ethnologist, Finally shall come 
the poet worthy that name, The true son of God 
shall come singing his songs. Then not your deeds only 
O voyagers, O scientists and inventors, shall be justified, All 
these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth'd, All 
affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be 
told, All these separations and gaps shall be taken up 
and hook'd and link'd together, The whole earth, this cold, 
impassive, voiceless earth, shall be completely justified, Trinitas divine shall 
be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the true son of 
God, the poet, (He shall indeed pass the straits and 
conquer the mountains, He shall double the cape of Good 
Hope to some purpose,) Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd 
and diffused no more, The true son of God shall 
absolutely fuse them. 6Year at whose wide-flung door I sing! 
Year of the purpose accomplish'd! Year of the marriage of 
continents, climates and oceans! (No mere doge of Venice now 
wedding the Adriatic,) I see O year in you the 
vast terraqueous globe given and giving all, Europe to Asia, 
Africa join'd, and they to the New World, The lands, 
geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival garland, As brides 
and bridegrooms hand in hand. Passage to India! Cooling airs 
from Caucasus far, soothing cradle of man, The river Euphrates
