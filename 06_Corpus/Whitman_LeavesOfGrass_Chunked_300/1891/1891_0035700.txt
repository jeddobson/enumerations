that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? Here 
is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is apropos; 
Do you know what it is as you pass to 
be loved by strangers? Do you know the talk of

The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd 
gates, ever provoking questions, These yearnings why are they? these 
thoughts in the darkness why are they? Why are there

sunlight expands my blood? Why when they leave me do 
my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? Why are

and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as 
I pass;) What is it I interchange so suddenly with 
strangers? What with some driver as I ride on the

seine by the shore as I walk by and pause?

man's good-will? what gives them to be free to mine? 
8The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness, 
I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all 
times, Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged. 
Here rises the fluid and attaching character, The fluid and 
attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and 
woman, (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and 
sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than 
it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)Toward the 
fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love 
of young and old, From it falls distill'd the charm
