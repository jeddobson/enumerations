As to me I know of nothing else but miracles, 
Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan, Or dart my 
sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky, Or 
wade with naked feet along the beach just in the 
edge of the water, Or stand under trees in the 
woods, Or talk by day with any one I love, 
or sleep in the bed at night with any one 
I love, Or sit at table at dinner with the 
rest, Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the 
car, Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a 
summer forenoon, Or animals feeding in the fields, Or birds, 
or the wonderfulness of insects in the air, Or the 
wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet 
and bright, Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the 
new moon in spring; These with the rest, one and 
all, are to me miracles, The whole referring, yet each 
distinct and in its place. To me every hour of 
the light and dark is a miracle, Every cubic inch 
of space is a miracle, Every square yard of the 
surface of the earth is spread with the same, Every 
foot of the interior swarms with the same. To me 
the sea is a continual miracle, The fishes that swim—the 
rocks—the motion of the waves— the ships with men in 
them, What stranger miracles are there? SPARKLES FROM THE WHEEL.WHERE 
the city's ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day, Withdrawn 
I join a group of children watching, I pause aside 
with them. By the curb toward the edge of the 
flagging, A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great 
knife, Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, 
by foot and knee, With measur'd tread he turns rapidly,
