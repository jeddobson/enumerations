break. My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach, 
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and 
volumes of worlds. Speech is the twin of my vision, 
it is unequal to measure itself, It provokes me forever, 
it says sarcastically, Walt you contain enough, why don't you 
let it out then? Come now I will not be 
tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation, Do you not 
know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded? 
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost, The dirt receding before 
my prophetical screams, I underlying causes to balance them at 
last, My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with 
the meaning of all things, Happiness, (which whoever hears me 
let him or her set out in search of this 
day.)My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from 
me what I really am, Encompass worlds, but never try 
to encompass me, I crowd your sleekest and best by 
simply looking toward you. Writing and talk do not prove 
me, I carry the plenum of proof and every thing 
else in my face, With the hush of my lips 
I wholly confound the skeptic. 26Now I will do nothing 
but listen, To accrue what I hear into this song, 
to let sounds contribute toward it. I hear bravuras of 
birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of 
sticks cooking my meals, I hear the sound I love, 
the sound of the human voice, I hear all sounds 
running together, combined, fused or following, Sounds of the city 
and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day 
and night, Talkative young ones to those that like them, 
the loud laugh of work-people at their meals, The angry 
base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,
