(Have I fought out and done indeed the battle?) Is 
there no shot left, For all thy affectations, lisps, scorns, 
manifold silliness? Nor for myself—my own rebellious self in thee? 
Down, down, proud gorge!—though choking thee; Thy bearded throat and 
high-borne forehead to the gutter; Crouch low thy neck to 
eleemosynary gifts. 412 LONG, LONG HENCE.AFTER a long, long course, 
hundreds of years, denials, Accumulations, rous'd love and joy and 
thought, Hopes, wishes, aspirations, ponderings, victories, myriads of readers, Coating,

scout call'd up and forward—the general mounted and his aids 
around him—the new-brought word—the instantaneous order issued; The rifle crack—the 
cannon thud—the rushing forth of men from their tents; The 
clank of cavalry—the strange celerity of forming ranks— the slender 
bugle note; The sound of horses' hoofs departing—saddles, arms, accoutre- 
ments. NOTE.—CAMDEN, N. J., August 7, 1888.—Walt Whitman asks the 
New York Herald "to add his tribute to Sheridan:" "In
