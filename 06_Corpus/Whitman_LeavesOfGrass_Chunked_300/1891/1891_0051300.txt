swarming groups and the centre-figure of all, From the head 
of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of gold- color'd light, 
But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head 
without its nim- bus of gold-color'd light, From my hand 
from the brain of every man and woman it streams, 
effulgently flowing forever. O I could sing such grandeurs and 
glories about you! You have not known what you are, 
you have slumber'd upon yourself all your life, Your eyelids 
have been the same as closed most of the time, 
What you have done returns already in mockeries, (Your thrift, 
knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mock- eries, 
what is their return?)The mockeries are not you, Underneath them 
and within them I see you lurk, I pursue you 
where none else has pursued you, Silence, the desk, the 
flippant expression, the night, the accustom'd routine, if these conceal 
you from others or from yourself, they do not conceal 
you from me, The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the 
impure complexion, if these balk others they do not balk 
me, The pert apparel, the deform'd attitude, drunkenness, greed, pre- 
mature death, all these I part aside. There is no 
endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in 
you, There is no virtue, no beauty in man or 
woman, but as good is in you, No pluck, no 
endurance in others, but as good is in you, No 
pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for 
you. As for me, I give nothing to any one 
except I give the like care- fully to you, I 
sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, 
sooner than I sing the songs of the glory of 
you. Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!
