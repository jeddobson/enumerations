maestros! And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, 
bassi! To you a new bard caroling in the West, 
Obeisant sends his love. (Such led to thee O soul, 
All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee, But now 
it seems to me sound leads o'er all the rest.)I 
hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul's 
cathedral, Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, 
the symphonies, oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn, The Creation 
in billows of godhood laves me. Give me to hold 
all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,) Fill me with all 
the voices of the universe, Endow me with their throbbings, 
Nature's also, The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches 
and dances, Utter, pour in, for I would take them 
all! 6Then I woke softly,And pausing, questioning awhile the music 
of my dream, And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest 
in its fury, And all the songs of sopranos and 
tenors, And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor, And 
the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs, And 
all the artless plaints of love and grief and death, 
I said to my silent curious soul out of the 
bed of the slumber- chamber, Come, for I have found 
the clew I sought so long, Let us go forth 
refresh'd amid the day, Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, 
the real, Nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream. And I 
said, moreover, Haply what thou hast heard O soul was 
not the sound of winds, Nor dream of raging storm, 
nor sea-hawk's flapping wings nor harsh scream, Nor vocalism of 
sun-bright Italy, Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of 
voices, nor layers of harmonies, Nor strophes of husbands and 
wives, nor sound of marching soldiers, Nor flutes, nor harps,
