around; I believe in those winged purposes, And acknowledge, red, 
yellow, white, playing within me,And consider green and violet, and 
the tufted crown, intentional,And do not call the tortoise unworthy 
because she is not something else,And the mocking-bird in the 
swamp never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to 
me,And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out

in the organ-loft, The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue 
of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,The married and 
unmarried children ride home to their thanksgiving dinner,The pilot seizes 
the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,The mate
