one word or deed—not venereal sore, dis- coloration, privacy of 
the onanist, putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal, 
murder, seduction, prostitution, but has results beyond death, as really 
as before death.Charity and personal force are the only invest- 
ments worth anything.No specification is necessary—all that a male or 
female does, that is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much 
profit to him or her in the unshakable order of 
the universe, and through the whole scope of it forever.Who 
has been wise, receives interest, Savage, felon, President, judge, prostitute,

and all of the present, and all of the future,All 
the brave actions of war and peace, All help given

the sick, and to shunned persons,All furtherance of fugitives, and 
of the escape of slaves,All self-denial that stood steady and 
aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of 
the boats,All offering of substance or life for the good 
old cause, or for a friend's sake, or opinion's sake,All 
pains of enthusiasts, scoffed at by their neigh- bors,All the 
limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,All honest men 
baffled in strifes recorded or unre- corded,All the grandeur and 
good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,All the good 
of the hundreds of ancient nations unknown to us by 
name, date, location,All that was ever manfully begun, whether it 
suc- ceeded or no,All suggestions of the divine mind of 
man, or the divinity of his mouth, or the shaping 
of his great hands;All that is well thought or said 
this day on any part of the globe—or on any
