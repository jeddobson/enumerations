host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?The 
sky up there—yet here, or next door, or across the 
way?The saints and sages in history—but you your- self?Sermons, creeds, 
theology—but the human brain, and what is called reason, and 
what is called love, and what is called life?I do 
not despise you, priests, My faith is the greatest of 
faiths, and the least of faiths,Enclosing all worship ancient and

on pavement and land, and outside of pavement and land,Belonging 
to the winders of the circuit of circuits.One of that 
centripetal and centrifugal gang, I turn and talk like a 
man leaving charges be- fore a journey.Down-hearted doubters, dull and 
excluded, Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dis- heartened, atheistical,I know 
every one of you, I know the unspoken interrogatories,By experience 
I know them. How the flukes splash! How they contort, 
rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!Be at 
peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,I take my
