to me are unspeakably perfect miracles. To me the sea

THERE was a child went forth every day, And the 
first object he looked upon and re- ceived with wonder, 
pity, love, or dread, that object he became,And that object

passed, and the quarrelsome boys, and the tidy and fresh-cheeked 
girls, and the bare-foot negro boy and girl,And all the 
changes of city and country, wherever he went.His own parents—he 
that had propelled the father-stuff at night and fathered him,
