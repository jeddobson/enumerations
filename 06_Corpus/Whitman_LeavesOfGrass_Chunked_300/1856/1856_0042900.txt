I become the other dreamers. I am a dance—Play up, 
there! the fit is whirling me fast!I am the ever-laughing—it 
is new moon and twilight,I see the hiding of douceurs, 
I see nimble ghosts whichever way I look,Cache, and cache

would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are 
journeying.Be careful, darkness! already, what was it touched me?I thought 
my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,I
