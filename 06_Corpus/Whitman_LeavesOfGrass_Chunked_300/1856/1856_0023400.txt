away from the axe,Both blade and helve are clean, They 
spirt no more the blood of European nobles, —they clasp 
no more the necks of queens.I see the headsman withdraw 
and become use- less,I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, 
I see no longer any axe upon it,I see the 
mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own 
race, the newest largest race.America! I do not vaunt my 
love for you, I have what I have. The axe 
leaps! The solid forest gives fluid utterances, They tumble forth, 
they rise and form, Hut, tent, landing, survey, Flail, plough, 
pick, crowbar, spade, Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel, 
gable,Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibi- tion-house, library,Cornice, trellis, pilaster, 
balcony, window, shutter, turret, porch,Hoe, rake, pitch-fork, pencil, wagon, staff, 
saw, jackplane, mallet, wedge, rounce,Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, 
sash, floor, Work-box, chest, stringed instrument, boat, frame, and what 
not,Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,Long 
stately rows in avenues, hospitals for or- phans or for 
the poor or sick,Manhattan steamboats and clippers, taking the measure 
of all seas.The shapes arise! Shapes of the using of 
axes anyhow, and the users, and all that neighbors them,Cutters 
down of wood, and haulers of it to the Penobscot, 
or St. John's, or Kennebec,Dwellers in cabins among the Californian 
moun- tains, or by the little lakes,Dwellers south on the 
banks of the Gila or Rio Grande—friendly gatherings, the characters 
and fun,Dwellers up north in Minnesota and by the Yellowstone 
river, dwellers on coasts and off coasts,Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen 
breaking pas- sages through the ice.The shapes arise! Shapes of 
factories, arsenals, foundries, markets, Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of 
railroads, Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frame- works, 
girders, arches,Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake craft,
