glare and dense shadows;The forger at his forge-furnace, and the 
user of iron after him,The maker of the axe large 
and small, and the welder and temperer,The chooser breathing his 
breath on the cold steel and trying the edge with

you think endures? Do you think the greatest city endures? 
Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or 
the best built steam-ships?Or hotels of granite and iron? or 
any chef- d'oeuvres of engineering, forts, armaments?Away! These are not
