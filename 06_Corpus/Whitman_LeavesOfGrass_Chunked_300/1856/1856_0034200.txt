equable showers!You animals moving serenely over the earth! You birds 
that wing yourselves through the air! you insects!You sprouting growths 
from the farmers' fields! you stalks and weeds by the

you,You express me better than I can express myself, You 
shall be more to me than my poem. I think 
heroic deeds were all conceived in the open air,I think 
I could stop here myself, and do miracles, I think
