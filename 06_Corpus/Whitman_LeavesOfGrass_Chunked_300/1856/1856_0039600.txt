the master among philosophs,Time, always without flaw, indicates itself in 
parts,What always indicates the poet, is the crowd of the 
pleasant company of singers, and their words,The words of the 
singers are the hours or min- utes of the light 
or dark—but the words of the maker of poems are 
the complete light and dark,The maker of poems settles justice, 
reality, im- mortality,His insight and power encircle things and the 
human race,He is the glory and extract, thus far, of

words of poems are the tuft and final applause of 
science.Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, 
rudeness of body, withdrawn- ness, gaiety, sun-tan, air-sweetness—such are the 
words of poems.The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of 
poems, The builder, geometer, mathematician, astronomer, melodist, philosoph, chemist, anatomist, 
spiritualist, language-searcher, geologist, phrenologist, artist—all these underlie the maker of 
poems.The words of poems give you more than poems, They 
give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war, 
peace, behaviour, histories, essays, romances, and every thing else,They balance
