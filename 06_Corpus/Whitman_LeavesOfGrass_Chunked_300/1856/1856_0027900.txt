builders, and brings its own styles. Mighty bards have done 
their work, and passed to other spheres,One work forever remains, 
the work of surpassing all they have done.America, curious toward 
foreign characters, stands sternly by its own,Stands removed, spacious, composite, 
sound, Sees itself promulger of men and women, initiates the 
true use of precedents,Does not repel them or the past, 
or what they have produced under their forms, or amid 
other politics, or amid the idea of castes, or the 
old religions,Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly 
borne from the eating and sleeping rooms of the house,Perceives

descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches, and 
that he shall be fit- test for his days.Any period, 
one nation must lead, One land must be the promise 
and reliance of the future.These States are the amplest poem, 
Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation 
of nations,Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast 
doings of the day and night,Here is what moves in 
magnificent masses, care- lessly faithful of particulars,Here are the roughs, 
beards, friendliness, com- bativeness, the soul loves,Here the flowing trains, 
here the crowds, equality, diversity, the soul loves.Race of races, 
and bards to corroborate! Of them, standing among them, one 
lifts to the light his west-bred face,To him the hereditary 
countenance bequeathed, both mother's and father's,His first parts substances, earth, 
water, animals, trees, Built of the common stock, having room 
for far and near,Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating 
this land,Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on 
its neck with incomparable love,Plunging his semitic muscle into its 
merits and demerits,Making its geography, cities, beginnings, events, glories, defections,
