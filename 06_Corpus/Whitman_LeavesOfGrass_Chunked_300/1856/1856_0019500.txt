they are not divine,I say they have all grown out 
of you, and may grow out of you still,It is 
not they who give the life, it is you who 
give the life,Leaves are not more shed from the trees, 
or trees from the earth, than they are shed out

or gray stone? or the lines of the arches and 
cornices?All music is what awakes from you, when you are 
reminded by the instruments,It is not the violins and the 
cornetsâ€”it is not the oboe nor the beating drums, nor 
the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet ro-

the women's chorus,It is nearer and farther than they. Will 
the whole come back then? Can each see signs of 
the best by a look in the looking-glass? is there
