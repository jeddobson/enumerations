is the touch of my lips to yours, this is 
the murmur of yearning,This is the far-off depth and height 
reflecting my own face,This is the thoughtful merge of myself, 
and the outlet again.Do you guess I have some intricate 
purpose? Well, I have—for the April rain has, and the 
mica on the side of a rock has.Do you take 
it I would astonish? Does the daylight astonish? Does the 
early red- start, twittering through the woods?Do I astonish more 
than they? This hour I tell things in confidence, I 
might not tell everybody, but I will tell you. Who 
goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude? How is it I 
extract strength from the beef I eat? What is a 
man anyhow? What am I? What are you?All I mark 
as my own, you shall offset it with your own,Else 
it were time lost listening to me. I do not 
snivel that snivel the world over, That months are vacuums, 
and the ground but wallow and filth,That life is a 
suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end 
but threadbare crape and tears.Whimpering and truckling fold with powders 
for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth- removed,I cock my 
hat as I please, indoors or out.Shall I pray? Shall 
I venerate and be cere- monious?I have pried through the 
strata, analyzed to a hair, Counselled with doctors, calculated close, 
found no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.In 
all people I see myself—none more, not one a barleycorn 
less,And the good or bad I say of myself I 
say of them.And I know I am solid and sound, 
To me the converging objects of the universe per- petually 
flow,All are written to me, and I must get what 
the writing means.I know I am deathless, I know this
