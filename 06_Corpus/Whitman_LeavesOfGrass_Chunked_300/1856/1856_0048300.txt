am I to you?To bear—to better—lacking these, of what avail 
am I?Accouche! Accouchez! Will you rot your own fruit in 
yourself there? Will you squat and stifle there? The earth 
does not argue, Is not pathetic, has no arrangements, Does 
not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,Makes no discriminations, has no 
conceivable failures,Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out, Of all 
the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.The earth

the voyage we pursue does not fail.Of the interminable sisters, 
Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters, Of the centripetal and

fas- cinations of age,Sits she whom I too love like 
the rest, sits undis- turbed,Holding up in her hand what 
has the character of a mirror, her eyes glancing back 
from it,Glancing thence as she sits, inviting none, denying none,Holding 
a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.Seen 
at hand, or seen at a distance, Duly the twenty-four 
appear in public every day, Duly approach and pass with 
their companions, or a companion,Looking from no countenances of their 
own, but from the countenances of those who are with 
them,From the countenances of children or women, or the manly
