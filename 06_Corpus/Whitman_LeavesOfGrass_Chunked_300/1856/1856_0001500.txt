companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as 
myself;They do not know how immortal, but I know. Every 
kind for itself and its own—for me mine, male and 
female,For me those that have been boys and that love 
women,For me the man that is proud, and feels how 
it stings to be slighted,For me the sweetheart and the

enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,The excited crowd, 
the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to 
the centre of the crowd,The impassive stones that receive and 
return so many echoes,The souls moving along—are they invisible, while 
the least of the stones is visible?What groans of over-fed
