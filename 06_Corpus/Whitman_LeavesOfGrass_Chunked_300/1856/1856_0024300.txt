clean-breathed,Ample-limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred and eighty pounds, 
full-blooded, six feet high, forty inches round the breast and 
back,Countenance sun-burnt, bearded, calm, unrefined, Reminder of animals, meeter of 
savage and gen- tleman on equal terms,Attitudes lithe and erect, 
costume free, neck open, of slow movement on foot,Passer of

try their strength against his.The shapes arise! Shapes of America, 
shapes of centuries, Shapes of those that do not joke

other shapes, Shapes of a hundred Free States, begetting another 
hundred north and south,Shapes of the turbulent manly cities, Shapes 
of the untamed breed of young men and natural persons,Shapes 
of women fit for These States, Shapes of the composition 
of all the varieties of the earth,Shapes of the friends 
and home-givers of the whole earth,Shapes bracing the whole earth, 
and braced with the whole earth. 161 6 â€” Poem

delight in them,Great are Adam and Eve, I too look 
back and accept them,Great the risen and fallen nations, and 
their poets, women, sages, inventors, rulers, warriors, priests.Great is liberty! 
Great is equality! I am their follower,Helmsmen of nations, choose
