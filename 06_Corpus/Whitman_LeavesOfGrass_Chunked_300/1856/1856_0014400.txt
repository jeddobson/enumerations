to mankind, Be not curious about God, For I, who 
am curious about each, am not curious about God,No array 
of terms can say how much I am at peace 
about God, and about death.I hear and behold God in 
every object, yet I understand God not in the least,Nor 
do I understand who there can be more won- derful 
than myself.Why should I wish to see God better than 
this day?I see something of God each hour of the 
twenty- four, and each moment then,In the faces of men 
and women I see God, and in my own face 
in the glass,I find letters from God dropped in the 
street, and every one is signed by God's name,And I 
leave them where they are, for I know that others 
will punctually come forever and ever.And as to you death, 
and you bitter hug of mor- tality, it is idle 
to try to alarm me.To his work without flinching the 
accoucheur comes,I see the elder-hand, pressing, receiving, support- ing,I recline 
by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, mark the 
outlet, mark the relief and escape.And as to you corpse, 
I think you are good manure, but that does not 
offend me,I smell the white roses sweet-scented and grow- ing,I 
reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polished 
breasts of melons.And as to you life, I reckon you 
are the leavings of many deaths,No doubt I have died 
myself ten thousand times before.I hear you whispering there, O 
stars of heaven, O suns, O grass of graves, O 
perpetual trans- fers and promotions, if you do not say 
any- thing, how can I say anything?Of the turbid pool 
that lies in the autumn forest, Of the moon that 
descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,Toss, sparkles of day
