showing more always and with velocity,Infinite and omnigenous, and the 
like of these among them,Not too exclusive toward the reachers 
of my re- membrancers,Picking out here one that I love, 
choosing to go with him on brotherly terms.A gigantic beauty 
of a stallion, fresh and respon- sive to my caresses,Head 
high in the forehead, wide between the ears,Limbs glossy and

rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,Prospecting, 
gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,Scorched ankle-deep by 
the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,Where 
the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, 
where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,Where the rattle-snake 
suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter 
is feeding on fish,Where the alligator in his tough pimples 
sleeps by the bayou,Where the black bear is searching for
