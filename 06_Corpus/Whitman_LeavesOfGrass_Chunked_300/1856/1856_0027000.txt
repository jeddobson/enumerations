through the centuries what heroes may come from them?In them, 
and of them, natal love—in them the divine mystery, the 
same old beautiful mystery.Have you ever loved the body of 
a woman? Have you ever loved the body of a 
man? Your father, where is your father? Your mother, is 
she living? Have you been much with her? and has 
she been much with you?Do you not see that these 
are exactly the same to all, in all nations and 
times, all over the earth?If any thing is sacred, the 
human body is sacred, And the glory and sweet of 
a man is the token of manhood untainted,And in man 
or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful as 
the most beautiful face.Have you seen the fool that corrupted 
his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her 
own live body?For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot 
conceal themselves.O my body! I dare not desert the likes 
of you in other men and women, nor the likes 
of the parts of you!I believe the likes of you 
are to stand or fall with the likes of the 
soul,I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall
