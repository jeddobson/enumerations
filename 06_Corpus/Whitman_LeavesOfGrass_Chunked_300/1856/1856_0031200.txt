That the winds are really not infectious! That this is 
no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which is

clothes, the house, medicine, print, buying, selling, eating, drinking, suffering, 
begetting, dying,They receive these in their places, they find these 
or the like of these, eternal, for reasons,They find themselves
