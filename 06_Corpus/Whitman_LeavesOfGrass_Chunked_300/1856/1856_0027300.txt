hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side,Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of 
the back-bone, Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and out- ward round, 
man-balls, man-root,Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,Leg-fibres, 
knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the
