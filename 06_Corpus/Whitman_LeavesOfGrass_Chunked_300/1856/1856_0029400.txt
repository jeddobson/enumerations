the organic compact of the first day of the first 
year of the independence of The States?Have you possessed yourself 
of the Federal Con- stitution?Do you acknowledge liberty with audible 
and absolute acknowledgment, and set slavery at naught for life 
and death?Do you see who have left described processes and 
poems behind them, and assumed new ones?Are you faithful to 
things? Do you teach what- ever the land and sea, 
the bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, excesses, crimes, teach?Have 
you sped through customs, laws, popu- larities?Can you hold your 
hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce contentions?Are you not 
of some coterie? some school or religion?Are you done with 
reviews and criticisms of life? animating to life itself?Have you 
possessed yourself with the spirit of the maternity of These 
States?Have you sucked the nipples of the breasts of the 
mother of many children?Have you too the old, ever-fresh, forbearance 
and impartiality?Do you hold the like love for those hardening 
to maturity? for the last-born? little and big? and for 
the errant?What is this you bring my America? Is it 
uniform with my country? Is it not something that has 
been better told or done before?Have you imported this, or 
the spirit of it, in some ship?Is it a mere 
tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? Has it never dangled at 
the heels of the poets, politicians, literats, of enemies' lands?Does 
it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still 
here?Does it answer universal needs? Will it improve manners?Can your 
performance face the open fields and the sea-side?Will it absorb 
into me as I absorb food, air, nobility, meannessâ€”to appear 
again in my strength, gait, face?Have real employments contributed to 
it? original makers, not amanuenses?Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, 
facts, face to face?Does it respect me? America? the soul?
