know I have the best of time and space, and 
was never measured, and never will be measured.I tramp a 
perpetual journey, My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, 
and a staff cut from the woods,No friend of mine 
takes his ease in my chair, I have no chair, 
no church, no philosophy, I lead no man to a 
dinner-table, library, exchange, But each man and each woman of 
you I lead upon a knoll,My left hand hooks you 
round the waist, My right hand points to landscapes of 
continents, and a plain public road.Not I, not any one 
else, can travel that road for you,You must travel it 
for yourself. It is not far, it is within reach, 
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born, 
and did not know,Perhaps it is every where on water 
and on land.Shoulder your duds, I will mine, let us 
hasten forth,Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as 
we go.If you tire, give me both burdens and rest 
the chuff of your hand on my hip,And in due 
time you shall repay the same ser- vice to me,For 
after we start we never lie by again. This day 
before dawn I ascended a hill and looked at the 
crowded heaven,And I said to my spirit, When we become 
the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge 
of every thing in them, shall we be filled and 
satisfied then?And my spirit said No, we level that lift 
to pass and continue beyond.You are also asking me questions, 
and I hear you, I answer that I cannot answer, 
you must find out for yourself.Sit awhile wayfarer, Here are 
biscuits to eat, here is milk to drink, But as 
soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,
