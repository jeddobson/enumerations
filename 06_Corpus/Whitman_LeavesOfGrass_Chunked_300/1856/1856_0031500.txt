eternal, they do not find that the water and soil 
tend to endure forever — and they not endure.Whoever you 
are, now I place my hand upon you, that you 
be my poem,I whisper with my lips close to your 
ear, I have loved many women and men, but I 
love none better than you.O I have been dilatory and 
dumb, I should have made my way straight to you 
long ago,I should have blabbed nothing but you, I should 
have chanted nothing but you.I will leave all, and come 
and make the hymns of you;None have understood you, but 
I understand you, None have done justice to you, you 
have not done justice to yourself,None but have found you 
imperfect, I only find no imperfection in you,None but would 
subordinate you, I only am he who will never consent 
to subordinate you,I only am he who places over you 
no master, owner, better, god, beyond what waits intrin- sically 
in yourself.Painters have painted their swarming groups, and the centre 
figure of all,From the head of the centre figure spreading 
a nimbus of gold-colored light,But I paint myriads of heads, 
but paint no head without its nimbus of gold-colored light,From 
my hand, from the brain of every man and woman 
it streams, effulgently flowing forever.O I could sing such grandeurs 
and glories about you!You have not known what you are—you 
have slumbered upon yourself all your life,Your eye-lids have been 
as much as closed most of the time,What you have 
done returns already in mock- eries,Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if 
they do not return in mockeries, what is their return?The 
mockeries are not you, Underneath them, and within them, I 
see you lurk, I pursue you where none else has 
pursued you, Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night,
