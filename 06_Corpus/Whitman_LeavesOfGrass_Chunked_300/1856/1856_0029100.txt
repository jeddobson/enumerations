of the first year of These States,He concentres in the 
real body and soul, and in the pleasure of things,He 
possesses the superiority of genuineness over fiction and romance;As he 
emits himself, facts are showered over with light,The day-light is 
lit with more volatile light—the deep between the setting and 
rising sun goes deeper many fold,Each precise object, condition, combination,

many and stern questions.Who are you that would talk to 
America? Have you studied out my land, its idioms and
