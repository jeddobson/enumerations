and she that conceived him in her womb and birthed 
him—they gave this child more of themselves than that,They gave 
him afterward every day—they and of them became part of 
him.The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on the 
supper-table,The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, 
a wholesome odor falling off her per- son and clothes 
as she walks by,The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, 
unjust,The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the 
crafty lure,The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture—the 
yearning and swelling heart,Affection that will not be gainsayed—the sense 
of what is real—the thought if, after all, it should 
prove unreal,The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night- 
time, the curious whether and how,Whether that which appears so 
is so, or is it all flashes and specks?Men and 
women crowding fast in the streets—if they are not flashes 
and specks what are they?The streets themselves, and the facades 
of houses, the goods in the windows,Vehicles, teams, the tiered 
wharves, the huge crossing at the ferries,The village on the 
highland seen from afar at sun- set, the river between,Shadows, 
aureola and mist, light falling on roofs and gables of 
white or brown, three miles off,The schooner near-by sleepily dropping 
down the tide, the little boat slack-towed astern,The hurrying tumbling 
waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,The strata of colored clouds, the long 
bar of ma- roon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread 
of purity it lies motionless in,The horizon's edge, the flying 
sea-crow, the fra- grance of salt-marsh and shore-mud;These became part 
of that child who went forth every day, who now 
goes, and will always go forth every day,And these become 
of him or her that peruses them now. 286 26
