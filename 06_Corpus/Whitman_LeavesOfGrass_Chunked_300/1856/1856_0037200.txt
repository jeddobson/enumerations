domiciles there,Nothing for any one, but what is for him—near 
and far are for him,The ships in the offing, the 
perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if

he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that hoes in 
the sugar-field,And both understand him, and know that his speech 
is right.He walks with perfect ease in the capitol, He
