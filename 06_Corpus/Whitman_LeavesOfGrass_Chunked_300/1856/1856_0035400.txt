blood, thews, endurance,None may come to the trial till he 
or she bring courage and health.Come not here if you 
have already spent the best of yourself!Only those may come 
who come in sweet and determined bodies,No diseased person—no rum-drinker

storms of seas, Sailors of many a ship, walkers of 
many a mile of land,Habitues of many different countries, habitues 
of far-distant dwellings,Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, 
solitary toilers,Pausers and contemplaters of tufts, blossoms, shells of the 
shore,Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, 
bearers of children,Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers 
down of coffins,Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years—the curious
