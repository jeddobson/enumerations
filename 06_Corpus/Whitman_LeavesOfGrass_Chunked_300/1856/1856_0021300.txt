of the eucha- rist, or the lath and plast, procreate 
as effec- tually as the young silver-smiths or bakers, or 
the masons in their over-alls,When a university course convinces like 
a slum- bering woman and child convince,When the minted gold 
in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter,When warrantee deeds 
loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly companions,I intend 
to reach them my hand, and make as much of 
them as I do of men and women. 140 5 
— Broad-Axe Poem. BROAD-AXE, shapely, naked, wan! Head from the 
mother's bowels drawn!Wooded flesh and metal bone! limb only one 
and lip only one!Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve produced 
from a little seed sown!Resting, the grass amid and upon, 
To be leaned, and to lean on. Strong shapes, and 
attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades, sights and sounds,Long varied 
train of an emblem, dabs of music, Fingers of the 
organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ.Welcome 
are all earth's lands, each for its kind, Welcome are 
lands of pine and oak, Welcome are lands of the 
lemon and fig, Welcome are lands of gold, Welcome are 
lands of wheat and maize—welcome those of the grape,Welcome are 
lands of sugar and rice, Welcome the cotton-lands—welcome those of 
the white potato and sweet potato,Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, 
forests, prai- ries,Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings,Welcome 
the measureless grazing lands—wel- come the teeming soil of orchards, 
flax, honey, hemp,Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced 
lands,Lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit 
lands,Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores, 
Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc, Lands of iron! 
lands of the make of the axe! The log at 
the wood-pile, the axe supported by it, The sylvan hut,
