the dwelling.I am less the reminder of property or qualities, 
and more the reminder of life,And go on the square 
for my own sake and for others' sakes,And make short 
account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women 
fully equipped,And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with 
fugi- tives and them that plot and conspire.Walt Whitman, an 
American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, 
drinking, breed- ing,No sentimentalist, no stander above men and wo- 
men, or apart from them—no more modest than immodest.Unscrew the 
locks from the doors! Unscrew the doors themselves from their 
jambs! Whoever degrades another degrades me, and whatever is done 
or said returns at last to me,And whatever I do 
or say, I also return. Through me the afflatus surging 
and surging — through me the current and index.I speak 
the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,By God! 
I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart 
of on the same terms.Through me many long dumb voices, 
Voices of the interminable generations of slaves, Voices of prostitutes, 
and of deformed persons, Voices of the diseased and despairing, 
and of thieves and dwarfs,Voices of cycles of preparation and 
accretion, And of the threads that connect the stars, and 
of wombs, and of the fatherstuff,And of the rights of 
them the others are down upon,Of the trivial, flat, foolish, 
despised, Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung. 
Through me forbidden voices, Voices of sexes and lusts—voices veiled, 
and I remove the veil,Voices indecent, by me clarified and 
transfigured. I do not press my finger across my mouth, 
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the 
head and heart,Copulation is no more rank to me than 
death is. I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
