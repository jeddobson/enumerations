the limbs of the body, or the fibres of plants.Of 
all races and eras, These States, with veins full of 
poetical stuff, most need poets, and are to have the 
greatest, and use them the greatest,Their Presidents shall not be 
their common ref- eree so much as their poets shall.Of 
mankind, the poet is the equable man, Not in him, 
but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of 
their full returns,Nothing out of its place is good, nothing 
in its place is bad,He bestows on every object or 
quality its fit pro- portions, neither more nor less,He is 
the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key, He 
is the equalizer of his age and land He supplies 
what wants supplying—he checks what wants checking,In peace, out of 
him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building 
populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study of 
man, the soul, health, immortality, government,In war he is the 
best backer of the war—he fetches artillery as good as 
the engineer's, he can make every word he speaks draw 
blood;The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady 
faith,He is no arguer, he is judgment, He judges not 
as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round 
a helpless thing,As he sees the farthest he has the 
most faith, His thoughts are the hymns of the praise 
of things, In the dispute on God and eternity he 
is silent, He sees eternity less like a play with 
a prologue and denouement,He sees eternity in men and women—he 
does not see men and women as dreams or dots.An 
American literat fills his own place, He justifies science—did you 
think the demon- strable less divine than the mythical?He stands 
by liberty according to the compact of the first day
