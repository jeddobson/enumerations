arms, he urges himself with his legs,I see his white 
body, I see his undaunted eyes, I hate the swift-running 
eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks.What are 
you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled waves?Will you kill the courageous 
giant? Will you kill him in the prime of his 
middle age?Steady and long he struggles, He is baffled, banged, 
bruised—he holds out while his strength holds out,The slapping eddies 
are spotted with his blood — they bear him away, 
they roll him, swing him, turn him,His beautiful body is 
borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruised on 
rocks,Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse. 
I turn, but do not extricate myself, Confused, a past-reading, 
another, but with dark- ness yet.The beach is cut by 
the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,The tempest lulls—the moon comes 
floundering through the drifts.I look where the ship helplessly heads 
end on—I hear the burst as she strikes—I hear the 
howls of dismay—they grow fainter and fainter.I cannot aid with 
my wringing fingers, I can but rush to the surf, 
and let it drench me and freeze upon me.I search 
with the crowd—not one of the company is washed to 
us alive;In the morning I help pick up the dead 
and lay them in rows in a barn.Now of the 
old war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn, Washington stands inside the 
lines, he stands on the entrenched hills amid a crowd 
of officers,His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress 
the weeping drops, he lifts the glass perpetually to his 
eyes, the color is blanched from his cheeks,He sees the 
slaughter of the southern braves con- fided to him by 
their parents.The same, at last and at last, when peace 
is declared,He stands in the room of the old tavern—the
