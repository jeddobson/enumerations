or shall come, from its due emission, without fail, either 
now, or then, or henceforth.Every thing indicates—the smallest does, and 
the largest does,A necessary film envelops all, and envelops the 
soul for a proper time.Now I am curious what sight 
can ever be more stately and admirable to me than 
my mast- hemm'd Manhatta, my river and sun-set, and my 
scallop-edged waves of flood-tide, the sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the 
hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter,Curious what gods 
can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and 
with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by 
my nighest name as I approach,Curious what is more subtle 
than this which ties me to the woman or man 
that looks in my face,Which fuses me into you now, 
and pours my meaning into you.We understand, then, do we 
not? What I promised without mentioning it, have you not 
accepted?What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not 
accomplish is accom- plished, is it not?What the push of 
reading could not start is started by me personally, is 
it not?Flow on, river! Flow with the flood-tide, and ebb 
with the ebb-tide!Frolic on, crested and scallop-edged waves! Gorgeous clouds 
of the sun-set, drench with your splendor me, or the 
men and women genera- tions after me!Cross from shore to 
shore, countless crowds of passengers!Stand up, tall masts of Manahatta!—stand 
up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!Bully for you! you proud, friendly, 
free Manhat- tanese!Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out ques- 
tions and answers!Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!Blab, 
blush, lie, steal, you or I or any one after 
us!Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street 
or public assembly!Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and 
mu- sically call me by my nighest name!Live, old life!
