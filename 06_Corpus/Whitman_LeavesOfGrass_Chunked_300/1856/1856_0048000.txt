were the words — those upright lines? those curves, angles, 
dots?No, those are not the words—the substantial words are in 
the ground and sea,They are in the air—they are in 
you. Were you thinking that those were the words — 
those delicious sounds out of your friends' mouths?No, the real 
words are more delicious than they. Human bodies are words, 
myriads of words, In the best poems re-appears the body, 
man's or woman's, well-shaped, natural, gay,Every part able, active, receptive, 
without shame or the need of shameAir, soil, water, fire, 
these are words, I myself am a word with them—my 
qualities interpenetrate with theirs—my name is noth- ing to them,Though 
it were told in the three thousand lan- guages, what 
would air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?A healthy 
presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings, meanings,The 
charms that go with the mere looks of some men 
and women are sayings and meanings also.The workmanship of souls 
is by the inaudible words of the earth,The great masters, 
the sayers, know the earth's words, and use them more 
than the audible words.Syllables are not the earth's words, Beauty, 
reality, manhood, time, life—the realities of such as these are 
the earth's words.Amelioration is one of the earth's words, The 
earth neither lags nor hastens, It has all attributes, growths, 
effects, latent in it- self from the jump,It is not 
half beautiful only—defects and excres- cences show just as much 
as perfections show.The earth does not withhold, it is generous 
enough,The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not 
so concealed either,They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print, They 
are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,Conveying a sentiment 
and invitation of the earth —I utter and utter,I speak 
not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail
