years, each emerging from that which preceded it,Journeyers as with 
companions, namely, their own diverse phases,Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized 
baby- days,Journeyers gaily with their own youth—journey- ers with their 
bearded and well-grained manhood,Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsur- passed, 
content,Journeyers with their sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,Old 
age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the 
universe,Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of 
death.Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless!To 
undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights! To merge 
all in the travel they tend to, and the days 
and nights they tend to!Again to merge them in the 
start of superior journeys!To see nothing anywhere but what you 
may reach it and pass it!To conceive no time, however 
distant, but what you may reach it and pass it!To 
look up or down no road but it stretches and 
waits for you! however long, but it stretches and waits 
for you!To see no being, not God's or any, but 
you also go thither!To see no possession but you may 
possess it! enjoying all without labor or purchase — abstracting 
the feast, yet not abstracting one particle of it;To take 
the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's 
elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, 
and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens!To take 
to your use out of the compact cities as you 
pass through!To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever 
you go!To gather the minds of men out of their 
brains as you encounter them! to gather the love out 
of their hearts!To take your own lovers on the road 
with you, for all that you leave them behind you!To 
know the universe itself as a road—as many roads—as roads
