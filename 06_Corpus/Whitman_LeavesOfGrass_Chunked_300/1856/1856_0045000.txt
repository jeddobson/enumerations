rise betimes,I will duly pass the day, O my mother, 
and duly return to you. 302 27 — Poem of 
Faces. SAUNTERING the pavement or riding the country by-road, here 
then are faces!Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,The spiritual 
prescient face—the always welcome, common, benevolent face,The face of the 
singing of music—the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges,

a haze more chill than the arctic sea, Its sleepy 
and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.This is a face 
of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,And 
more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.This face is 
an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,Its
