or half-starved who fall sun-struck, or in fits,What exclamations of 
women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to 
babes,What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what 
howls restrained by decorum,Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, 
acceptances, rejections with convex lips,I mind them or the resonance 
of them—I come and I depart.The big doors of the 
country-barn stand open and ready,The dried grass of the harvest-time 
loads the slow-drawn wagon,The clear light plays on the brown 
gray and green intertinged,The armfuls are packed to the sagging 
mow; I am there, I help, I came stretched atop 
of the load,I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined 
on the other; I jump from the cross-beams and seize 
the clover and timothy,And roll head over heels, and tangle 
my hair full of wisps.Alone, far in the wilds and

glee, In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to 
pass the night,Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-killed game, 
Soundly falling asleep on the gathered leaves, my dog and 
gun by my side.The Yankee clipper is under her three 
sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,My eyes settle the 
land—I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the 
deck.The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopped for me,I 
tucked my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had 
a good time,You should have been with us that day 
round the chowder-kettle.I saw the marriage of the trapper in 
the open air in the far-west—the bride was a red 
girl,Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly 
smoking—they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets 
hanging from their shoulders,On a bank lounged the trapper, he 
was dressed mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls
