laugh at me?It is not you alone who know what 
it is to be evil,I am he who knew what 
it was to be evil, I too knitted the old 
knot of contrariety, Blabbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged, Had 
guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,Was wayward, 
vain, greedy, shallow, sly, a solitary committer, a coward, a 
malignant person,The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in 
me, The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adul- terous 
wish, not wanting,Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, lazi- ness, none of 
these wanting.But I was a Manhattanese, free, friendly, and proud!I 
was called by my nighest name by clear loud voices 
of young men as they saw me ap- proaching or 
passing,Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or 
the neg- ligent leaning of their flesh against me as 
I sat,Saw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, 
or public assembly, yet never told them a word,Lived the 
same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, 
sleeping,Played the part that still looks back on the actor 
or actress,The same old role, the role that is what 
we make it, as great as we like, or as 
small as we like, or both great and small.Closer yet 
I approach you, What thought you have of me, I 
had as much of youâ€”I laid in my stores in 
advance,I considered long and seriously of you before you were 
born.Who was to know what should come home to me? 
Who knows but I am enjoying this? Who knows but 
I am as good as looking at you now, for 
all you cannot see me?It is not you alone, nor 
I alone, Not a few races, not a few generations, 
not a few centuries,It is that each came, or comes,
