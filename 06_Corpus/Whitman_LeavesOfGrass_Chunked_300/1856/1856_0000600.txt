the rest.I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing; As the 
hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the 
night, and withdraws at the peep of the day,And leaves 
for me baskets covered with white towels, swelling the house 
with their plenty,Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and 
scream at my eyes,That they turn from gazing after and 
down the road,And forthwith cipher and show me to a

other. Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop 
from your throat,Not words, not music or rhyme I want—not 
cus- tom or lecture, not even the best,Only the lull
