hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away. O hot-cheeked 
and blushing! O foolish hectic! O for pity's sake, no 
one must see me now! my clothes were stolen while 
I was abed,Now I am thrust forth, where shall I 
run? Pier that I saw dimly last night, when I 
looked from the windows!Pier out from the main, let me

just ripened;The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in 
darkness,And liquor is spilled on lips and bosoms by touch-

earth.A shroud I see, and I am the shroud—I wrap 
a body and lie in the coffin,It is dark here 
underground, it is not evil or pain here, it is 
blank here, for reasons.It seems to me that everything in 
the light and air ought to be happy,Whoever is not 
in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know 
he has enough.I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked 
through the eddies of the sea,His brown hair lies close 
and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous
