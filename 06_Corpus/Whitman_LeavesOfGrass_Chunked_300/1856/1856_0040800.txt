antiques of the same come limping,Some appear wooden-legged and some 
appear bandaged and bloodless.Why this is a show! It has 
called the dead out of the earth!The old grave-yards of 
the hills have hurried to see!Uncountable phantoms gather by flank 
and rear of it!Cocked hats of mothy mould! crutches made 
of mist!Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's 
shoulders!What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering 
of bare gums?Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you

shall send a committee to England,They shall get a grant 
from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal 
vault,Dig out King George's coffin—unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes—box 
up his bones for a journey,Find a swift Yankee clipper—here 
is freight for you, black-bellied clipper!Up with your anchor! shake 
out your sails! steer straight toward Boston bay.Now call the 
President's marshal again, bring out the government cannon,Fetch home the 
roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard it with foot 
and dragoons.This centre-piece for them: Look! all orderly citizens—look from 
the win- dows, women!The committee open the box, set up
