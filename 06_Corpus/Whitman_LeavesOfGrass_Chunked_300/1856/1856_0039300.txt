of the wander- ing stars, or on any of the 
fixed stars, by those there as we are here,All that 
is henceforth to be thought or done by you, whoever 
you are, or by any one,These inure, have inured, shall 
inure, to the identities from which they sprang, or shall 
spring.Did you guess anything lived only its moment? The world 
does not so exist—no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,No 
consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation, and 
that from some other, without the farthest conceivable one coming 
a bit nearer the beginning than any.Whatever satisfies souls is 
true, Prudence satisfies the craving and glut of souls. Itself 
finally satisfies the soul, The soul has that measureless pride 
which re- volts from every lesson but its own.Now I 
give you an inkling, Now I breathe the word of 
the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,That answers 
the pride which refuses every les- son but its own.What 
is prudence, is indivisible, Declines to separate one part of 
life from every part,Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous, 
or the living from the dead,Matches every thought or act 
by its correlative, Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atone- 
ment,Knows that the young man who composedly periled his life 
and lost it, has done exceeding well for himself, without 
doubt,That he who never periled his life, but retains it 
to old age in riches and ease, has probably achieved 
nothing for himself worth men- tioning;Knows that only the person 
has learned, who has learned to prefer results,Who favors body 
and soul the same, Who perceives the indirect assuredly following 
the direct,Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither 
hurries or avoids death. 262 19 — Poem of The
