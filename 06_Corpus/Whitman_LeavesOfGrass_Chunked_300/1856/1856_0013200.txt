of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,Calling my 
name from flower-beds, vines, tangled under-brush,Or while I swim in 
the bath, or drink from the pump at the corner, 
or the curtain is down at the opera, or I 
glimpse at a woman's face in the rail-road car,Lighting on 
every moment of my life, Bussing my body with soft 
balsamic busses, Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and 
giving them to be mine.Old age superbly rising! Ineffable grace 
of dying days!Every condition promulges not only itself, it pro-

hush promulges as much as any.I open my scuttle at 
night and see the far- sprinkled systems,And all I see, 
multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge but the 
rim of the farther systems.Wider and wider they spread, expanding, 
always expanding,Outward, outward, forever outward. My sun has his sun, 
and round him obediently wheels,He joins with his partners a 
group of superior circuit,And greater sets follow, making specks of 
the greatest inside them.There is no stoppage, and never can 
be stoppage, If I, you, the worlds, all beneath or 
upon their surfaces, and all the palpable life, were this 
moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not 
avail in the long run,We should surely bring up again 
where we now stand,And as surely go as much farther, 
and then far- ther and farther.A few quadrillions of eras, 
a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the 
span, or make it impatient,They are but parts, any thing 
is but a part. See ever so far, there is 
limitless space outside of that,Count ever so much, there is 
limitless time around that.My rendezvous is appointed, The Lord will 
be there and wait till I come on perfect terms.I
