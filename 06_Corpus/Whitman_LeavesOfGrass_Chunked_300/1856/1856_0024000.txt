murderer with haggard face and pinioned arms,The sheriff at hand 
with his deputies, the silent and white-lipped crowd, the sickening 
dan- gling of the rope.The shapes arise! Shapes of doors 
giving so many exits and entrances,The door passing the dissevered 
friend, flushed, and in haste,The door that admits good news 
and bad news, The door whence the son left home, 
confident and puffed up,The door he entered from a long 
and scandalous absence, diseased, broken down, without in- nocence, without 
means.Their shapes arise, the shapes of full-sized men! Men taciturn 
yet loving, used to the open air, and the manners 
of the open air,Saying their ardor in native forms, saying 
the old response,Take what I have then, (saying fain,) take 
the pay you approached for,Take the white tears of my 
blood, if that is what you are after.Her shape arises! 
She, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,The 
gross and soiled she moves among do not make her 
gross and soiled,She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing 
is concealed from her,She is none the less considerate or 
friendly there- fore,She is the best-beloved, it is without exception, 
she has no reason to fear, and she does not 
fear,Oaths, quarrels, hiccuped songs, smutty expres- sions, are idle to 
her as she passes,She is silent, she is possessed of 
herself, they do not offend her,She receives them as the 
laws of nature receive them, she is strong,She too is 
a law of nature, there is no law greater than 
she is.His shape arises! Arrogant, masculine, naive, rowdyish, Laugher, weeper, 
worker, idler, citizen, country- man,Saunterer of woods, stander upon hills, 
summer swimmer in rivers or by the sea,Of pure American 
breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint 
from top to toe, free forever from headache and dyspepsia,
