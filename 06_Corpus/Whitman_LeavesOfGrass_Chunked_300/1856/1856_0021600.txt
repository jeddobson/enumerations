the vine over the doorway, the space cleared for a 
garden,The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after 
the storm is lulled,The wailing and moaning at intervals, the 
thought of the sea,The thought of ships struck in the

in the mortises, according as they were prepared,The blows of 
mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curved
