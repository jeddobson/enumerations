nor the law of us changed,I have dreamed that heroes 
and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,And 
that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and 
past law,For I have dreamed that the law they are 
under now is enough.And I have dreamed that the satisfaction 
is not so much changed, and that there is no

indicate that it is good. How beautiful and perfect are 
the animals! How perfect is my soul!How perfect the earth, 
and the minutest thing upon it!What is called good is 
perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,The 
vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids 
are perfect;Slowly and surely they have passed on to this, 
and slowly and surely they yet pass on.My soul! if 
I realize you, I have satisfaction, Animals and vegetables! if 
I realize you, I have satisfaction,Laws of the earth and 
air! if I realize you, I have satisfaction.I cannot define 
my satisfaction, yet it is so, I cannot define my
