company at last, How the lank loose-gowned women looked when 
boated from the side of their prepared graves,How the silent 
old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped unshaved 
men,All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it

they tenderly life me forth.I lie in the night air 
in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my 
sake.Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so un-
