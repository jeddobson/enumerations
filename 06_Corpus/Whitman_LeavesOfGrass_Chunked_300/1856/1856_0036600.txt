loves, beauties, delights of the earth,All the governments, judges, gods, 
followed per- sons of the earth,These are contained in sex, 
as parts of itself and justifications of itself.Without shame the 
man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his 
sex,Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.O 
I will fetch bully breeds of children yet! They cannot

our own sake, but for others' sakes,Enveloped in you sleep 
greater heroes and bards, They refuse to awake at the

make my way, I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable—but I 
love you,I do not hurt you any more than is 
necessary for you,I pour the stuff to start sons and 
daughters fit for These States—I press with slow rude muscle,I 
brace myself effectually—I listen to no en- treaties,I dare not
