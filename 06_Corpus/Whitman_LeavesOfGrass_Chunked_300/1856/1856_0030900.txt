me where I thought I was safest,I withdraw from the 
still woods I loved, I will not go now on 
the pastures to walk, I will not strip my clothes 
from my body to meet my lover the sea,I will 
not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other 
flesh, to renew me.How can the ground not sicken of 
men? How can you be alive, you growths of spring? 
How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, 
orchards, grain?Are they not continually putting distempered corpses in the 
earth?Is not every continent worked over and over with sour 
dead?Where have you disposed of those carcasses of the drunkards 
and gluttons of so many gen- erations?Where have you drawn 
off all the foul liquid and meat?I do not see 
any of it upon you today—or per- haps I am 
deceived,I will run a furrow with my plough—I will press 
my spade through the sod, and turn it up underneath,I 
am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat. 
Behold! This is the compost of billions of premature corpses,Perhaps 
every mite has once formed part of a sick person,Yet 
Behold! The grass covers the prairies, The bean bursts noiselessly 
through the mould in the garden,The delicate spear of the 
onion pierces upward, The apple-buds cluster together on the apple- 
branches,The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out 
of its graves,The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the 
mulberry-tree,The he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit 
on their nests,The young of poultry break through the hatched 
eggs,The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from 
the cow, the colt from the mare,Out of its little 
hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,Out of its 
hill rises the yellow maize-stalk; The summer growth is innocent
