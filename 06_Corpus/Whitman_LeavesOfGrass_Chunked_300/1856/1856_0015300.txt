great thing upon the earth, and through eternity—but every jot 
of the great- ness of man is unfolded out of 
woman,First the man is shaped in the woman, he can 
then be shaped in himself. 103 3 — Poem of 
Salutation. O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!Such gliding wonders! Such 
sights and sounds!Such joined unended links, each hooked to the 
next!Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.What widens 
within you, Walt Whitman? What waves and soils exuding? What

me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon, and 
sinks again;Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plains, volca- noes, groups,Oceanica, 
Australasia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.What do you

farmer's wife singing,I hear in the distance the sounds of 
children, and of animals early in the day,I hear the 
inimitable music of the voices of mothers,I hear the persuasions 
of lovers, I hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of 
East Tennessee and Kentucky, hunting on hills,I hear emulous shouts 
of Australians, pursuing the wild horse,I hear the Spanish dance
