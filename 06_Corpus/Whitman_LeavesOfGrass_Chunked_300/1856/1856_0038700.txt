kind? For I will take the like sweets, and pay 
them in kind;And who possesses a perfect and enamored body? 
For I do not believe any one possesses a more

thoughts? For I will surround those thoughts;And who has made 
hymns fit for the earth? For I am mad with 
devouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth!
