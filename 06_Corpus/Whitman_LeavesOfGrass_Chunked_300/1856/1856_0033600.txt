play the part that looks back on the actor or 
actress!Play the old role, the role that is great or 
small, according as one makes it!Consider, you who peruse me, 
whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon 
you!Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who 
lean idly, yet haste with the hasting cur- rent!Fly on, 
sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in 
the air!Receive the summer-sky, you water! faithfully hold it till 
all downcast eyes have time to take it from you!Diverge, 
fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, 
or any one's head, in the sun-lit water!Come on, ships,

me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest 
aromas!Thrive, cities! Bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and 
sufficient rivers!Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more 
spiritual!Keep your places, objects than which none else is more 
lasting!We descend upon you and all things, we arrest you

and fluids,Through you color, form, location, sublimity, ideality,Through you every 
proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and determinations of ourselves.You 
have waited, you always wait, you dumb beautiful ministers! you 
novices!We receive you with free sense at last, and are 
insatiate henceforward,Not you any more shall be able to foil 
us, or with- hold yourselves from us,We use you, and 
do not cast you asideâ€”we plant you permanently within us,We
