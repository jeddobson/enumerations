deaths—all of past, present, future, This vast similitude spans them, 
and always has spanned, and shall forever span them. 252

the night, draped interminably, head front and form, in scarlet 
folds,Whose face and eyes none may see, Out of its 
robes only this—the red robes, lifted by the arm,One finger, 
pointed high over the top, like the head of a
