to- day?What does it mean to me? to American persons, 
pro- gresses, cities? Chicago, Canada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian, 
native, immi- grant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?Does it 
encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all 
men and women, the genital impulse of The States?Does it 
see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians, standing, menacing, 
silent, the mechanics, Manhattanese, western men, southerners, significant alike in 
their apathy and in the promptness of their love?Does it

the dust of skeletons? By the road-side others disdainfully tossed? 
Rhymes and rhymers pass away—poems dis- tilled from other poems 
pass away,The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and 
leave ashes,Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make the soil of literature;America 
justifies itself, give it time—no disguise can deceive it or

deferred till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he 
has absorbed it.He masters whose spirit masters—he tastes sweetest who 
results sweetest,The blood of the brawn beloved of time is 
uncon- straint,In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, 
an appropriate native grand-opera, ship-craft, any craft, he or she 
is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical example.Already a 
nonchalant breed silently fills the houses and streets,People's lips salute 
only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers;There will shortly be no 
more priests—their work is done,Death is without emergencies here, but 
life is per- petual emergencies here,Are your body, days, manners,
