river craft.The shapes arise! Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Atlantic 
and Pacific, and in many a bay and by-place,The live-oak 
kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatuck-roots for knees,The 
ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the

young rum-drinker and the old rum-drinker,The shape of the shamed 
and angry stairs, trod by sneaking footsteps,The shape of the 
sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple,The shape of the 
gambling board with its devilish winnings and losings,The shape of 
the slats of the bed of a corrupted body, the 
bed of the corruption of gluttony or alcoholic drinks,The shape 
of the step-ladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer, the
