me to be free to a woman's or man's good-will? 
What gives them to be free to mine?The efflux of 
the soul is happiness—here is happiness,I think it pervades the 
air, waiting at all times, Now it flows into us—we 
are rightly charged. Here rises the fluid and attaching character; 
The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness 
of man and woman,The herbs of the morning sprout no 
fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of 
them- selves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet contin- ually 
out of itself.Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the 
sweat of the love of young and old,From it falls 
distilled the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,Toward it heaves 
the shuddering longing ache of contact.Allons! Whoever you are, come 
travel with me!Traveling with me, you find what never tires. 
The earth never tires! The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible 
at first—nature is rude and incomprehensible at first,Be not discouraged—keep 
on—there are divine things, well enveloped,I swear to you there 
are divine things more beau- tiful than words can tell!Allons! 
We must not stop here! However sweet these laid-up stores, 
however convenient this dwelling, we cannot remain here!However sheltered this 
port, however calm these waters, we must not anchor here!However 
welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we are permitted to 
receive it but a little while.Allons! the inducements shall be 
great to you, We will sail pathless and wild seas, 
We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the 
Yankee clipper speeds by under full sail.Allons! With power, liberty, 
the earth, the elements!Health, defiance, gaiety, self-esteem, curiosity! Allons! From 
all formulas! From your formulas, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests!The 
stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no longer.Allons! 
Yet take warning! He traveling with me needs the best
