is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.To think that 
the sun rose in the east! that men and women 
were flexible, real, alive! that every thing was alive!To think 
that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor

and we quite indifferent!I see one building the house that 
serves him a few years, or seventy or eighty years 
at most,I see one building the house that serves him
