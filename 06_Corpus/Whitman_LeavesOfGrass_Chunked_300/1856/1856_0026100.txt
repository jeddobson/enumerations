evening is enough,To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breath- ing, 
laughing flesh is enough,To pass among them, to touch any 
one, to rest my arm ever so lightly round his 
or her neck for a moment—what is this, then?I do 
not ask any more delight, I swim in it, as 
in a sea.There is something in staying close to men 
and women, and looking on them, and in the con-

dawn,Undulating into the willing and yielding day, Lost in the 
cleave of the clasping and sweet- fleshed day.This is the

merge of small and large, and the outlet again.Be not 
ashamed, women! your privilege encloses the rest, it is the 
exit of the rest,You are the gates of the body, 
and you are the gates of the soul!The female contains
