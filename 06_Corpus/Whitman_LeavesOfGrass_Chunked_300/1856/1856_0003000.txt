stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,The 
duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,The deacons are ordained 
with crossed hands at the altar,The spinning-girl retreats and advances 
to the hum of the big wheel,The farmer stops by 
the bars of a Sunday and looks at the oats 
and rye,The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, 
a con- firmed case,He will never sleep any more as 
he did in the cot in his mother's bedroom;The jour 
printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his 
case,He turns his quid of tobacco, his eyes get blurred 
with the manuscript;The malformed limbs are tied to the anatomist's 
table,What is removed drops horribly in a pail; The quadroon 
girl is sold at the stand—the drunkard nods by the 
bar-room stove,The machinist rolls up his sleeves—the police- man travels 
his beat—the gate-keeper marks who pass,The young fellow drives the 
express-wagon — I love him though I do not know 
him,The half-breed straps on his light boots to com- pete 
in the race,The western turkey-shooting draws old and young —some 
lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,Out from the 
crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;The 
groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,The woolly-pates 
hoe in the sugar-field, the over- seer views them from 
his saddle,The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run 
for their partners, the dancers bow to each other,The youth 
lies awake in the cedar-roofed garret, and harks to the 
musical rain,The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps 
fill the Huron,The reformer ascends the platform, he spouts with 
his mouth and nose,The company returns from its excursion, the 
darkey brings up the rear and bears the well- riddled 
target,The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemmed cloth, is offering moccasins
