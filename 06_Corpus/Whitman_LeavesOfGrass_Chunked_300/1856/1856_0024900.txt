times when it lay in covering waters and gases.Great is 
the quality of truth in man, The quality of truth 
in man supports itself through all changes,It is inevitably in 
the man—he and it are in love, and never leave 
each other.The truth in man is no dictum, it is 
vital as eye- sight,If there be any soul, there is 
truth—if there be man or woman, there is truth—if there 
be physical or moral, there is truth,If there be equilibrium 
or volition, there is truth —if there be things at 
all upon the earth, there is truth.O truth of the 
earth! O truth of things! I am determined to press 
the whole way toward you,Sound your voice! I scale mountains, 
or dive in the sea after you.Great is language—it is 
the mightiest of the sciences,It is the fulness, color, form, 
diversity of the earth, and of men and women, and 
of all qualities and processes,It is greater than wealth—it is 
greater than buildings, ships, religions, paintings, music.Great is the English 
speech—what speech is so great as the English?Great is the 
English brood—what brood has so vast a destiny as the 
English?It is the mother of the brood that must rule 
the earth with the new rule,The new rule shall rule 
as the soul rules, and as the love, justice, equality 
in the soul, rule.Great in the law—great are the old 
few land- marks of the law,They are the same in 
all times, and shall not be disturbed.Great are marriage, commerce, 
newspapers, books, free-trade, rail-roads, steamers, interna- tional mails, telegraphs, exchanges.Great 
is justice! Justice is not settled by legislators and laws—it 
is in the soul,It cannot be varied by statutes, any 
more than love, pride, the attraction of gravity, can,It is 
immutable—it does not depend on major- ities—majorities or what not
