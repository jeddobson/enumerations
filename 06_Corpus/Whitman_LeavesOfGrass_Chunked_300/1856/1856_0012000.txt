tides,Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,Ever the old 
inexplicable query, ever that thorned thumb, that breath of itches 
and thirsts,Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where 
the sly one hides, and bring him forth;Ever love, ever

printed and bound book—but the printer, and the printing-office boy?The 
marriage estate and settlement—but the body and mind of the 
bridegroom? also those of the bride?The panorama of the sea—but 
the sea itself? The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend 
close and solid in your arms?The fleet of ships of 
the line, and all the modern improvements—but the craft and 
pluck of the admiral?The dishes and fare and furniture—but the
