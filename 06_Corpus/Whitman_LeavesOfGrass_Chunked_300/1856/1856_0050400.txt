are thenceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.The threads that were 
spun are gathered, the weft crosses the warp, the pattern 
is systematic.The preparations have every one been justified, The orchestra 
have tuned their instruments suffi- ciently, the baton has given 
the signal.The guest that was coming—he waited long for reasons—he 
is now housed,He is one of those who are beautiful 
and happy — he is one of those that to 
look upon and be with is enough.The law of the 
past cannot be eluded! The law of the present and 
future cannot be eluded!The law of the living cannot be 
eluded—it is eternal!The law of promotion and transformation cannot be 
eluded!The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded!The law 
of drunkards, informers, mean persons, cannot be eluded!Slow-moving and black 
lines go ceaselessly over the earth,Northerner goes carried, and southerner 
goes car- ried, and they on the Atlantic side, and 
they on the Pacific, and they between, and all through 
the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.The great masters 
and kosmos are well as they go—the heroes and good-doers 
are well,The known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners 
and pious and distinguished, may be well,But there is more 
account than that—there is strict account of all.The interminable hordes 
of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,The barbarians of 
Africa and Asia are not nothing, The common people of 
Europe are not nothing — the American aborigines are not 
nothing,The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing—the murderer 
or mean person is not nothing,The perpetual successions of shallow 
people are not nothing as they go,The prostitute is not 
nothing—the mocker of re- ligion is not nothing as he 
goes.I shall go with the rest—we have satisfaction, I have 
dreamed that we are not to be changed so much,
