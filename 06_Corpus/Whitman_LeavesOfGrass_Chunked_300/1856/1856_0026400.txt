all qualities, and tempers them—she is in her place, she 
moves with perfect balance,She is all things duly veiled, she 
is both passive and active—she is to conceive daughters as 
well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.As I 
see my soul reflected in nature, as I see through 
a mist, one with inexpressible com- pleteness and beauty—see the 
bent head and arms folded over the breast, the female 
I see,I see the bearer of the great fruit which 
is im- mortality—the good thereof is not tasted by roues, 
and never can be.The male is not less the soul, 
nor more—he too is in his place,He too is all 
qualities, he is action and power, the flush of the 
known universe is in him,Scorn becomes him well, and appetite 
and defi- ance become him well,The fiercest largest passions, bliss 
that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him well 
— pride is for him,The full-spread pride of man is 
calming and ex- cellent to the soul,Knowledge becomes him, he 
likes it always, he brings everything to the test of 
himself,Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he 
strikes soundings at last only here,Where else does he strike 
soundings, except here?The man's body is sacred, and the woman's 
body is sacred—it is no matter who,Is it a slave? 
Is it one of the dull-faced immi- grants just landed 
on the wharf?Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much 
as the well-off, just as much as you,Each has his 
or her place in the procession. All is a procession! 
The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion!Do 
you know so much, that you call the slave or 
the dull-face ignorant?Do you suppose you have a right to 
a good sight, and he or she has no right
