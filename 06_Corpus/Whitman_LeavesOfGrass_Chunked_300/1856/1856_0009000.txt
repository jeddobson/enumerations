tillions green.I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing 
soul, My course runs below the soundings of plummets. I 
help myself to material and immaterial, No guard can shut 
me off, no law can prevent me. I anchor my 
ship for a little while only, My messengers continually cruise 
away, or bring their returns to me.I go hunting polar

and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and death chasing it 
up and down the storm,How he knuckled tight, and gave
