by the night. Press close, bare-bosomed night! press close, magnetic, 
nourishing night!Night of south winds! night of the large few 
stars!Still, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night! Smile, O voluptuous, 
cool-breathed earth! Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! Earth

hate and conciliation,Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in 
each others' arms.I am he attesting sympathy, Shall I make 
my list of things in the house, and skip the 
house that supports them?I am the poet of commonsense, and
