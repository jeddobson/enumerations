which fills its period and place is equal to any.Were 
mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?I 
am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous 
upon me,All has been gentle with me, I keep no 
account with lamentation;What have I to do with lamentation? I 
am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser 
of things to be.My feet strike an apex of the 
apices of the stairs, On every step bunches of ages, 
and larger bunches between the steps,All below duly traveled, and 
still I mount and mount.Rise after rise bow the phantoms 
behind me, Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, 
I know I was even there,I waited unseen and always, 
and slept through the lethargic mist,And took my time, and 
took no hurt from the fœtid carbon.Long I was hugged 
close—long and long. Immense have been the preparations for me, 
Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me. Cycles 
ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,For room 
to me stars kept aside in their own rings,They sent 
influences to look after what was to hold me.Before I 
was born out of my mother generations guided me,My embryo 
has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it,For it the 
nebula cohered to an orb, the long slow strata piled 
to rest it on, vast vegetables gave it sustenance,Monstrous sauroids 
transported it in their mouths, and deposited it with care.All 
forces have been steadily employed to com- plete and delight 
me,Now I stand on this spot with my soul. Span 
of youth! ever-pushed elasticity! manhood, balanced, florid, full!My lovers suffocate 
me! Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my 
skin, Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked 
to me at night,Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks
