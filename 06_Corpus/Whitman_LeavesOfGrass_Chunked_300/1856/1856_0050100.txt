make little or no account!The vulgar and the refined, what 
you call sin and what you call goodness—to think how 
wide a difference!To think the difference will still continue to 
oth- ers, yet we lie beyond the difference!To think how 
much pleasure there is! Have you pleasure from looking at 
the sky? have you pleasure from poems?Do you enjoy yourself 
in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a 
nomination and elec- tion? or with your wife and family?Or 
with your mother and sisters? or in womanly house-work? or 
the beautiful maternal cares?These also flow onward to others—you and

is well, and not to take interest shall be well.The 
sky continues beautiful, the pleasure of men with women shall 
never be sated, nor the pleasure of women with men, 
nor the pleas- ure from poems,The domestic joys, the daily 
house-work or busi- ness, the building of houses—these are not 
phantasms, they have weight, form, location;Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, 
government, are none of them phantasms,The difference between sin and 
goodness is no delusion,The earth is not an echo—man and 
his life, and all the things of his life, are 
well-considered.You are not thrown to the winds—you gather certainly and 
safely around yourself,Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever! It is 
not to diffuse you that you were born of your 
mother and father—it is to identify you,It is not that 
you should be undecided, but that you should be decided;Something 
long preparing and formless is arrived and formed in you,You
