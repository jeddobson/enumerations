the fruits of the gush- ing showers I give now,I 
shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, 
immortality I plant so lovingly now. 244 14 â€” Poem

profound earth and its attributes, and the un- quiet ocean,All 
enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will buy,The 
best farms, others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably reaps,The 
noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building, and he
