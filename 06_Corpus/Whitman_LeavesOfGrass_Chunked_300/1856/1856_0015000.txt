to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love,If 
you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.You 
will hardly know who I am, or what I mean, 
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And 
filter and fibre your blood. Failing to fetch me at 
first, keep encouraged, Missing me one place, search another, I 
stop some where waiting for you. 101 2 — Poem

the woman, all jus- tice is unfolded,Unfolded out of the 
sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;A man is a
