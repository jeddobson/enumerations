the body were not the soul, what is the soul?The 
expression of the body of man or woman balks account,The 
male is perfect, and that of the female is per- 
fect.The expression of a well-made man appears not only in 
his face,It is in his limbs and joints also, it 
is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,It 
is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the 
flex of his waist and kneesâ€”dress does not hide him,The 
strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton 
and flannel,To see him pass conveys as much as the 
best poem, perhaps more,You linger to see his back, and 
the back of his neck and shoulder-side.The sprawl and fulness 
of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds 
of their dress, their style as we pass in the 
street, the con- tour of their shape downwards,The swimmer naked 
in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent 
green- shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls 
silently in the heave of the water,The bending forward and 
backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,Girls, 
mothers, house-keepers, in all their per- formances,The group of laborers 
seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives 
waiting,The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the 
garden or cow-yard,The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver guiding 
his six horses through the crowd,The wrestle of wrestlers, two 
apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant 
lot at sun-down, after work,The coats and caps thrown down, 
the embrace of love and resistance,The upper-hold and under-hold, the 
hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;The march of firemen 
in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through 
clean-set- ting trowsers and waist-straps,The slow return from the fire,
