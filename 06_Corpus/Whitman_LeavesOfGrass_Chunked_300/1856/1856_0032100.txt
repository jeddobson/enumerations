also face to face.Crowds of men and women attired in 
the usual costumes, how curious you are to me!On the 
ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross are more curious 
to me than you suppose,And you that shall cross from 
shore to shore years hence, are more to me, and 
more in my meditations, than you might suppose.The impalpable sustenance 
of me from all things at all hours of the 
day,The simple, compact, well-joined scheme—my- self disintegrated, every one disintegrated, 
yet part of the scheme,The similitudes of the past and 
those of the future,The glories strung like beads on my 
smallest sights and hearings—on the walk in the street, and 
the passage over the river,The current rushing so swiftly, and 
swimming with me far away,The others that are to follow 
me, the ties between me and them,The certainty of others—the 
life, love, sight, hearing of others.Others will enter the gates 
of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore,Others will 
watch the run of the flood-tide, Others will see the 
shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of 
Brooklyn to the south and east,Others will see the islands 
large and small, Fifty years hence others will see them 
as they cross, the sun half an hour high,A hundred 
years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others 
will see them,Will enjoy the sun-set, the pouring in of 
the flood- tide, the falling back to the sea of 
the ebb- tide.It avails not, neither time or place—distance avails 
not,I am with you, you men and women of a 
genera- tion, or ever so many generations hence,I project myself, 
also I return—I am with you, and know how it 
is.Just as you feel when you look on the river 
and sky, so I felt,Just as any of you is
