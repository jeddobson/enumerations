was chilled with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between 
us.I pass so poorly with paper and types, I must 
pass with the contact of bodies and souls.I do not 
thank you for liking me as I am, and liking 
the touch of me—I know that it is good for 
you to do so.Were all educations practical and ornamental well 
displayed out of me, what would it amount to?Were I 
as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman, what would 
it amount to?Were I to you as the boss employing 
and paying you, would that satisfy you?The learned, virtuous, benevolent, 
and the usual terms,A man like me, and never the 
usual terms. Neither a servant nor a master am I, 
I take no sooner a large price than a small 
price —I will have my own, whoever enjoys me,I will 
be even with you, and you shall be even with 
me.If you are a workman or workwoman, I stand as 
nigh as the nighest that works in the same shop,If 
you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I 
demand as good as your brother or dearest friend,If your 
lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I 
must be personally as welcome,If you become degraded, criminal, ill, 
then I become so for your sake,If you remember your 
foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think I cannot remember 
my own foolish and outlawed deeds? plenty of them?If you 
carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite side 
of the table,If you meet some stranger in the street, 
and love him or her, do I not often meet 
strangers in the street and love them?If you see a 
good deal remarkable in me, I see just as much, 
perhaps more, in you.Why what have you thought of yourself?
