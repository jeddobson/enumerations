jump that they are to be laws to themselves, and 
to depend on themselves,Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs, Where

mine, there are the miners, The forge-furnace is there, the 
melt is accom- plished, the hammers-men are at hand with 
their tongs and hammers,What always served and always serves, is
