and dusk! Toss on the black stems that decay in 
the muck!Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs! 
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night, 
And perceive of the ghastly glimmer the sun- beams reflected,And 
debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great 
or small.There is that in me—I do not know what 
it is — but I know it is in me.Wrenched 
and sweaty, calm and cool then my body becomes,I sleep—I 
sleep long. I do not know it—it is without name—it 
is a word unsaid,It is not in any dictionary, utterance, 
symbol. Something it swings on more than the earth I 
swing on,To it the creation is the friend whose embracing 
awakes me.Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for 
my brothers and sisters.Do you see, O my brothers and 
sisters? It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, 
plan —it is eternal life—it is happiness.The past and present 
wilt—I have filled them, emptied them,And proceed to fill my 
next fold of the future.Listener up there! here you! what 
have you to confide to me?Look in my face while 
I snuff the sidle of evening,Talk honestly, no one else 
hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.Do I 
contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself, I am 
large, I contain multitudes. I concentrate toward them that are 
nigh, I wait on the door-slab.Who has done his day's 
work? who will soonest be through with his supper?Who wishes 
to walk with me? Will you speak before I am 
gone? will you prove already too late?The spotted hawk swoops 
by and accuses me — he complains of my gab 
and my loitering.I too am not a bit tamed—I too 
am untrans- latable,I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs
