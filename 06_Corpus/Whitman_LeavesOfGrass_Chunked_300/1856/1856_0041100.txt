the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay,Clap the 
skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown 
on top of the skull.You have got your revenge, old 
buster! The crown is come to its own, and more 
than its own.Stick your hands in your pockets Jonathan—you are 
a made man from this day,You are mighty cute, and 
here is one of your bargains. 275 23 — Poem 
of Remembrances for A Girl or A Boy of These 
States. REMEMBER the organic compact of These States!Remember the pledge 
of the Old Thirteen thence- forward to the rights, life, 
liberty, equality, of man!Remember what was promulged by the founders, 
ratified by The States, signed in black and white by 
the Commissioners, read by Wash- ington at the head of 
the army!Remember the purposes of the founders!—Re- member Washington!Remember the 
copious humanity streaming from every direction toward America!Remember the hospitality 
that belongs to nations and men!—(Cursed be nation, woman, man, 
without hospitality!)Remember, government is to subserve individuals! Not any, not 
the President, is to have one jot more than you 
or me,Not any habitan of America is to have one 
jot less than you or me.Anticipate when the thirty or 
fifty millions are to become the hundred, or two hundred, 
or five hundred millions, of equal freemen and free- women, 
amicably joined.Recall ages—One age is but a part—ages are but 
a part,Recall the angers, bickerings, delusions, supersti- tions of the 
idea of caste,Recall the bloody cruelties and crimes. Anticipate the 
best women! I say an unnumbered new race of hardy 
and well- defined women are to spread through all These 
States,I say a girl fit for These States must be 
free, capable, dauntless, just the same as a boy.Anticipate your 
own life—retract with merciless power,Shirk nothing—retract in time—Do you see
