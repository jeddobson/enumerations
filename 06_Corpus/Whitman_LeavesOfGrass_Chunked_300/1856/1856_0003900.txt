as a northerner, a planter non- chalant and hospitable,A Yankee 
bound my own way, ready for trade, my joints the 
limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,A 
Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin 
leggings,A boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts —

impalpable is in its place.These are the thoughts of all 
men in all ages and lands, they are not original 
with me,If they are not yours as much as mine, 
they are nothing, or next to nothing,If they do not
