the accustomed routine, if these con- ceal you from others, 
or from yourself, they do not conceal you from me,The 
shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these 
balk others, they do not balk me,The pert apparel, the 
deformed attitude, drunken- ness, greed, premature death, all these I 
part aside,I track through your windings and turnings—I come upon 
you where you thought eye should never come upon you.There 
is no endowment in man or woman that is not 
tallied in you,There is no virtue, no beauty, in man 
or woman but as good is in you,No pluck, no 
endurance in others, but as good is in you,No pleasure 
waiting for others, but an equal plea- sure waits for

I give the like carefully to you,I sing the songs 
of the glory of none, not God, sooner than I 
sing the songs of the glory of you.Whoever you are, 
you are to hold your own at any hazard,These shows 
of the east and west are tame com- pared to 
you,These immense meadows, these interminable riv- ers—you are immense and 
interminable as they,These furies, elements, storms, motions of nature, throes 
of apparent dissolution—you are he or she who is master 
or mistress over them,Master or mistress in your own right 
over nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution.The hopples fall from your 
ankles! you find an unfailing sufficiency!Old, young, male, female, rude, 
low, rejected by the rest, whatever you are promulges itself,Through 
birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is 
scanted,Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks 
its way. 211 11 — Sun-Down Poem. FLOOD-TIDE of the 
river, flow on! I watch you, face to face,Clouds of 
the west! sun half an hour high! I see you
