stinging me as much as it ever can any one,The 
sensitive, orbic, underlapped brothers, that only privileged feelers may be 
intimate where they are,The curious roamer, the hand, roaming all 
over the body—the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers 
soothingly pause and edge themselves,The limpid liquid within the young 
man, The vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful, The 
torment—the irritable tide that will not be at rest,The like 
of the same I feel—the like of the same in 
others,The young woman that flushes and flushes, and the young 
man that flushes and flushes,The young man that wakes, deep 
at night, the hot hand seeking to repress what would 
master him—the strange half-welcome pangs, vis- ions, sweats—the pulse pounding 
through palms and trembling encirling fingers—the young man all colored, 
red, ashamed, angry;The souse upon me of my lover the 
sea, as I lie willing and naked,The merriment of the 
twin-babes that crawl over the grass in the sun, the 
mother never turn- ing her vigilant eyes from them,The walnut-trunk, 
the walnut-husks, and the ripen- ing or ripened long-round walnuts,The 
continence of vegetables, birds, animals, The consequent meanness of me 
should I skulk or find myself indecent, while birds and 
animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent,The great chastity 
of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity,The oath 
of procreation I have sworn, The greed that eats in 
me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate 
what shall pro- duce boys to fill my place when 
I am through,The wholesome relief, repose, content, And this bunch 
plucked at random from myself, It has done its work—I 
toss it carelessly to fall where it may. 313 29
