schools,A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the 
metaphysics of books.To behold the day-break! The little light fades 
the immense and diaphanous shadows,The air tastes good to my 
palate. Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols, silently 
rising, freshly exuding,Scooting obliquely high and low. Something I cannot

the best I am.Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass 
me,I crowd your noisiest talk by looking toward you. Writing 
and talk do not prove me, I carry the plenum 
of proof, and every thing else, in my face,With the
