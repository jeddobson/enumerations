friendship, hospitality, pro- creation,Not my soul, not the last explanation 
of prudence, Not the similitude that interlocks me with all 
identities that exist, or ever have existed,Not faith, sin, defiance, 
nor any disposition or duty of myself,Not the promulgation of 
liberty, not to cheer up slaves and horrify despots,Not to 
build for that which builds for mankind, Not to balance 
ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,Not to justify science, not 
the march of equality, Not to feed the arrogant blood 
of the brawn beloved of time.I swear I am for 
those that have never been mastered!For men and women whose 
tempers have never been mastered,For those whom laws, theories, conventions, 
can never master.I swear I am for those who walk 
abreast with America and with the earth!Who inaugurate one to 
inaugurate all. I swear I will not be outfaced by 
irrational things! I will penetrate what it is in them 
that is sarcastic upon me!I will make cities and civilizations 
defer to me! I will confront these shows of the 
day and night! I will know if I am to 
be less than they! I will see if I am 
not as majestic as they! I will see if I 
am not as subtle and real as they! I will 
see if I am to be less generous than they! 
I will see if I have no meaning, and the 
houses and ships have meaning!I will see if the fishes 
and birds are to be enough for themselves, and I 
am not to be enough for myself!I match my spirit 
against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,I will learn why 
the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked,I take you to be 
mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms. 202 9 â€” Poem
