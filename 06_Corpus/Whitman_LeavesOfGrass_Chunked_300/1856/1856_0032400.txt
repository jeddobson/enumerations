one of a living crowd, I was one of a 
crowd,Just as you are refreshed by the gladness of the 
river, and the bright flow, I was refreshed,Just as you 
stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the 
swift current, I stood, yet was hur- ried,Just as you 
look on the numberless masts of ships, and the thick-stemmed 
pipes of steamboats, I looked.I too many and many a

left the rest in strong shadow,I saw the slow-wheeling circles 
and the gradual edging toward the south.I too saw the 
reflection of the summer-sky in the water.Had my eyes dazzled

the ships at anchor,The sailors at work in the rigging 
or out astride the spars,The round masts, the swinging motion 
of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants,The large and small 
steamers in motion, the pi- lots in their pilot-houses,The white 
wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of 
the wheels,The flags of all nations, the falling of them 
at sun-set,The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, 
the frolicsome crests and glisten- ing,The stretch afar growing dimmer 
and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite store-houses by
