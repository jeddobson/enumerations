nothing,If they are not just as close as they are 
distant, they are nothing.This is the grass that grows wherever 
the land is and the water is,This is the common 
air that bathes the globe. This is the breath of 
laws, songs, behaviour, This is the tasteless water of souls,

between them and the rest.This is the press of a 
bashful hand, this is the float and odor of hair,This
