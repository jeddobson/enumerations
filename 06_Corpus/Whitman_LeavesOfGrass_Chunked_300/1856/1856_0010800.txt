cuffed head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,I discover myself on the verge 
of a usual mistake. That I could forget the mockers 
and insults! That I could forget the trickling tears, and 
the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!That I could look 
with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody 
crowning!I remember, I resume the overstaid fraction, The grave of 
rock multiplies what has been con- fided to it, or 
to any graves,The corpses rise, the gashes heal, the fastenings 
roll away.I troop forth replenished with supreme power, one of 
an average unending procession,We walk the roads of Ohio, Massachusetts, 
Vir- ginia, Wisconsin, Manhattan Island, New Orleans, Texas, Montreal, San 
Francisco, Charleston, Havana, Mexico,Inland and by the sea-coast and boundary 
lines, and we pass all boundary lines.Our swift ordinances are 
on their way over the whole earth,The blossoms we wear 
in our hats are the growth of two thousand years.Eleves, 
I salute you! I see the approach of your numberless 
gangs, I see you understand yourselves and me,And know that 
they who have eyes are divine, and the blind and 
lame are equally divine,And that my steps drag behind yours, 
yet go be- fore them,And are aware how I am 
with you no more than I am with everybody.The friendly 
and flowing savage, Who is he? Is he waiting for 
civilization, or past it and mas- tering it?Is he some 
south-westerner, raised out-doors? Is he Canadian?Is he from the Mississippi 
country? from Iowa, Oregon, California? from the mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? 
from the sea?Wherever he goes men and women accept and 
desire him;They desire he should like them, touch them speak 
to them, stay with them.Behaviour lawless as snow-flakes, words simple 
as grass, uncombed head, laughter, naivete,Slow-stepping feet, common features, common 
modes and emanations,They descend in new forms from the tips
