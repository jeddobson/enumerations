the greatest traitor,I went myself first to the head-land, my 
own hands carried me there.You villain touch! what are you 
doing? my breath is tight in its throat,Unclench your floodgates! 
you are too much for me.Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheathed,

would adorn the parlors of heaven,And the narrowest hinge in 
my hand puts to scorn all machinery,And the cow crunching 
with depressed head sur- passes any statue,And a mouse is 
miracle enough to stagger sex- tillions of infidels,And I could
