whatever I meet on the road I shall like, and 
whatever beholds me shall like me,I think whoever I see 
must be happy. From this hour, freedom! From this hour, 
I ordain myself loosed of limits and imaginary lines!Going where 
I list—my own master, total and absolute,Listening to others, and 
considering well what they say,Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, Gently but 
with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds that would 
hold me.I inhale great draughts of air, The east and 
the west are mine, and the north and the south 
are mine.I am larger than I thought! I did not 
know I held so much goodness! All seems beautiful to 
me, I can repeat over to men and women, You 
have done such good to me, I would do the 
same to you.I will recruit for myself and you as 
I go, I will scatter myself among men and women 
as I go,I will toss the new gladness and roughness 
among them;Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me, Whoever 
accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall 
bless me.Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, 
it would not amaze me,Now if a thousand beautiful forms 
of women ap- peared, it would not astonish me.Now I 
see the secret of the making of the best persons,It 
is to grow in the open air, and to eat 
and sleep with the earth.Here is space—here a great personal 
deed has room,A great deed seizes upon the hearts of 
the whole race of men,Its effusion of strength and will 
overwhelms law, and mocks all authority and all argument against 
it.Here is the test of wisdom, Wisdom is not finally 
tested in schools, Wisdom cannot be passed from one having 
it, to another not having it,Wisdom is of the soul,
