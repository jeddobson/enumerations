of his fingers,They are wafted with the odor of his 
body or breath, they fly out of the glance of 
his eyes.Flaunt of the sun-shine, I need not your bask, 
lie over!You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths 
also.Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,Say 
old top-knot! what do you want? Man or woman! I 
might tell how I like you, but cannot,And might tell 
what it is in me, and what it is in 
you, but cannot,And might tell the pinings I have, the 
pulse of my nights and days.Behold I do not give 
lectures or a little charity, What I give I give 
out of myself. You there, impotent, loose in the knees, 
open your scarfed chops till I blow grit within you,Spread 
your palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets,I am 
not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty 
and to spare,And any thing I have I bestow; I 
do not ask who you are, that is not important 
to me,You can do nothing, and be nothing, but what 
I will infold you.To a drudge of the cotton-fields or 
cleaner of privies I leanâ€”on his right cheek I put 
the family kiss,And in my soul I swear, I never 
will deny him. On women fit for conception I start 
bigger and nimbler babes,This day I am jetting the stuff 
of far more arro- gant republics.To any one dying, thither 
I speed and twist the knob of the door,Turn the 
bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed, Let the physician 
and the priest go home. I seize the descending man, 
I raise him with re- sistless will.O despairer, here is 
my neck, By God! you shall not go down! hang 
your whole weight upon me.I dilate you with tremendous breath,
