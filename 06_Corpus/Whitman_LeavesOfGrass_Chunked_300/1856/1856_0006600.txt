hush of my lips I confound the topmost skeptic.I think 
I will do nothing for a long time but listen, 
To accrue what I hear into myself, to let sounds 
contribute toward me.I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing 
wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.I

his mouth is pouring and filling me full.I hear the 
trained soprano, she convulses me like the climax of my 
love-grip,The orchestra wrenches such ardors from me, I did not 
know I possessed them,It throbs me to gulps of the 
farthest down horror, It sails me, I dab with bare
