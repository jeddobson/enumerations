veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they 
show nothing but their whites,Its teeth grit, the palms of 
the hands are cut by the turned-in nails,The man falls 
struggling and foaming to the ground while he speculates well.This 
face is bitten by vermin and worms, And this is 
some murderer's knife with a half- pulled scabbard.This face owes 
to the sexton his dismalest fee, An unceasing death-bell tolls 
there. Those then are really men, the bosses and tufts 
of the great round globe!Features of my equals, would you 
trick me with your creased and cadaverous march?Well, you cannot 
trick me. I see your rounded never-erased flow, I see 
neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.Splay and 
twist as you like—poke with the tan- gling fores of 
fishes or rats,You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will. I saw 
the face of the most smeared and slobbering idiot they 
had at the asylum,And I knew for my consolation what 
they knew not,I knew of the agents that emptied and 
broke my brother,The same wait to clear the rubbish from 
the fallen tenement,And I shall look again in a score 
or two of ages,And I shall meet the real landlord 
perfect and unharmed, every inch as good as myself.The Lord 
advances, and yet advances! Always the shadow in front! always 
the reached hand bringing up the laggards!Out of this face 
emerge banners and horses—O superb! I see what is coming,I 
see the high pioneer-caps—I see the staves of runners clearing 
the way,I hear victorious drums. This face is a life-boat, 
This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no 
odds of the rest,This face is flavored fruit, ready for 
eating, This face of a healthy honest boy is the 
programme of all good.These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,
