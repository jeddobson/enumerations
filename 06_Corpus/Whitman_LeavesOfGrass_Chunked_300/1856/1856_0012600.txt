place among you as much as among any,The past is 
the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,Day and 
night are for you, me, all, And what is yet 
untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the

I know it is sure, alive, sufficient. Each who passes

thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,There are trillions 
ahead, and trillions ahead of them.Births have brought us richness 
and variety, And other births will bring us richness and 
variety.I do not call one greater and one smaller, That
