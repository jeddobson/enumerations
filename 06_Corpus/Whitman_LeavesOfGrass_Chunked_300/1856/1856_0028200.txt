diversities, vocal in him,Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in 
him, Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Missouri, Columbia, 
Ohio, St. Law- rence, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,The 
blue breadth over the sea off Massachusetts and Maine, or 
over the Virginia and Maryland sea, or over inland Champlain, 
Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, Superior, or over the Texan, Mexican, 
Cuban, Floridian seas, or over the seas off California and 
Oregon, not tallying the breadth of the waters below, more 
than the breadth of above and below is tallied in 
him,If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, 
he stretching with them north or south,Spanning between them east 
and west, and touch- ing whatever is between them,Growths growing 
from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar, hemlock, 
live-oak, locust, chest- nut, cypress, hickory, lime-tree, cotton-wood, tulip-tree, cactus, 
tamarind, orange, magnolia, persimmon,Tangles as tangled in him as any 
cane-brake or swamp,He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests 
coated with transparent ice, and icicles hang- ing from the 
boughs,Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savannah, upland, prairie,Through 
him flights, songs, screams, answering those of the wild-pigeon, high-hold, 
orchard- oriole, coot, surf-duck, red-shouldered-hawk, fish-hawk, white-ibis, indian-hen, cat-owl, water-pheasant, 
qua-bird, pied-sheldrake, mocking-bird, buzzard, condor, night-heron, eagle;His spirit surrounding his 
country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil,Surrounding the essences of 
real things, old times and present times,Surrounding just found shores, 
islands, tribes of red aborigines,Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, the rapid 
stature and muscle,The haughty defiance of the Year 1â€”war, peace, 
the formation of the Constitution,The separate States, the simple, elastic 
scheme, the immigrants,The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always 
calm and impregnable,The unsurveyed interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, 
trappers;Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the gestation of new 
States,Congress convening every December, the mem- bers duly coming up
