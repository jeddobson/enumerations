Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag 
of me is a miracle.Divine am I inside and out, 
and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched 
from,The scent of these arm-pits is aroma finer than prayer,This

any particular thing, it shall be some of the spread 
of my own body,Translucent mould of me, it shall be

friendship I take again.To walk up my stoop is unaccountable, 
I pause to consider if it really be,That I eat 
and drink is spectacle enough for the great authors and
