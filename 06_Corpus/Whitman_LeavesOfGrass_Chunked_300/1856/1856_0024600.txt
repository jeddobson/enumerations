your craft! where you sail, I sail!Yours is the muscle 
of life or death, yours is the perfect science, in 
you I have absolute faith.Great is today, and beautiful, It 
is good to live in this age, there never was 
any better.Great are the plunges, throes, triumphs, falls of democracy,Great 
the reformers, with their lapses and screams, Great the daring 
and venture of sailors on new explorations.Great are yourself and 
myself, We are just as good and bad as the 
oldest and youngest or any,What the best and worst did, 
we could do, What they felt, do not we feel 
it in ourselves? What they wished, do we not wish

great is expres- sion, great is silence,Youth, large, lusty, loving—youth,

then the soul's wealth, which is candor, knowledge, pride, enfolding 
love;(Who goes for men and women showing poverty richer than 
wealth?)Expression of speech! in what is written or said, forget 
not that silence is also expressive,That anguish as hot as 
the hottest, and contempt as cold as the coldest, may 
be without words,That the true adoration is likewise without words, 
and without kneeling.Great is the greatest nation! the nation of 
clus- ters of equal nations!Great is the earth, and the 
way it became what it is,Do you imagine it is 
stopped at this? the increase abandoned?Understand then that it goes 
as far onward from this, as this is from the
