those errors, diseases, weaknesses, lies, thefts?Do you see that lost 
character?—Do you see decay, consumption, rum-drinking, dropsy, fever, mortal cancer 
or inflammation?Do you see death, and the approach of death? 
Think of the soul! I swear to you that body 
of yours gives proportions to your soul somehow to live 
in other spheres,I do not know how, but I know 
it is so.Think of loving and being loved! I swear 
to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse yourself with 
such things that everybody that sees you shall look longingly 
upon you!Think of the past! I warn you that in 
a little while others will find their past in you 
and your times.The race is never separated—nor man nor woman 
escapes,All is inextricable—things, spirits, nature, nations, you too—from precedents you 
come.Recall the ever-welcome defiers! (The mothers precede them;)Recall the sages, 
poets, saviours, inventors, law- givers, of the earth,Recall Christ, brother 
of rejected persons — brother of slaves, felons, idiots, and 
of insane and diseased persons.Think of the time when you 
was not yet born! Think of times you stood at 
the side of the dying! Think of the time when 
your own body will be dying!Think of spiritual results! Sure 
as the earth swims through the heavens, does every one 
of its objects pass into spiritual results!Think of manhood, and 
you to be a man! Do you count manhood, and 
the sweet of manhood, nothing?Think of womanhood, and you to 
be a woman! The creation is womanhood, Have I not 
said that womanhood involves all? Have I not told how 
the universe has nothing better than the best womanhood? 279
