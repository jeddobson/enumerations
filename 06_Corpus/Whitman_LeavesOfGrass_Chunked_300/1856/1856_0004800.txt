orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,I 
know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut 
with a burnt stick at night.I know I am august,I 
do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be 
understood,I see that the elementary laws never apologize, I reckon 
I behave no prouder than the level I plant my 
house by, after all.I exist as I am, that is 
enough, If no other in the world be aware, I 
sit content, And if each and all be aware, I

largest to me, and that is myself,And whether I come 
to my own today, or in ten thousand or ten 
million years,I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal

in granite, I laugh at what you call dissolution, And 
I know the amplitude of time. I am the poet 
of the body, And I am the poet of the 
soul. The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the 
pains of hell are with me,The first I graft and 
increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new 
tongue.I am the poet of the woman the same as 
the man, And I say it is as great to 
be a woman as to be a man,And I say 
there is nothing greater than the mother of men.I chant 
the chant of dilation or pride, We have had ducking 
and deprecating about enough,I show that size is only development. 
Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?It is 
a trifleâ€”they will more than arrive there every one, and 
still pass on.I am he that walks with the tender 
and growing night,I call to the earth and sea, half-held
