men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to 
the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to 
them,They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant 
and bending arch,They do not think whom they souse with 
spray. The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his 
knife at the stall in the mar- ket,I loiter, enjoying 
his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.Blacksmiths with grimed and 
hairy chests environ the anvil,Each has his main-sledge—they are all 
out — there is a great heat in the fire.From 
the cinder-strewed threshold I follow their movements,The lithe sheer of 
their waists plays even with their massive arms,Overhand the hammers 
roll, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,They do not hasten, 
each man hits in his place. The negro holds firmly 
the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath

hat away from his forehead,The sun falls on his crispy 
hair and moustache, falls on the black of his polish'd 
and perfect limbs.I behold the picturesque giant and love him, 
and I do not stop there,I go with the team 
also. In me the caresser of life wherever moving, back-

bending. Oxen that rattle the yoke or halt in the 
shade! what is that you express in your eyes?It seems 
to me more than all the print I have read 
in my life.My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on 
my distant and day-long ramble,They rise together, they slowly circle
