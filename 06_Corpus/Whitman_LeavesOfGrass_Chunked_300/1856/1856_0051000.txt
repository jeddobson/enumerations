life, yet it is so. O I swear I think 
now that every thing has an eternal soul!The trees have, 
rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! 
the animals!I swear I think there is nothing but immortality! 
That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebu- 
lous float is for it, and the cohering is for 
it!And all preparation is for it! and identity is for 
it! and life and death are for it!
