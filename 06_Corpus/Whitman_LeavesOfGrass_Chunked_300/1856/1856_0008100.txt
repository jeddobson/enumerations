roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with 
his paddle-tail,Over the growing sugar, over the cotton-plant, over the 
rice in its low moist field,Over the sharp-peaked farm-house, with 
its scal- loped scum and slender shoots from the gut- 
ters,Over the western persimmon, over the long-leaved corn, over the 
delicate blue-flowered flax,Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer 
and buzzer there with the rest,Over the dusky green of 
the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze,Scaling 
mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged 
limbs,Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through 
the leaves of the brush,Where the quail is whistling betwixt 
the woods and the wheat-lot,Where the bat flies in the 
July eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,Where 
the flails keep time on the barn floor, Where the 
brook puts out of the roots of the old tree 
and flows to the meadow,Where cattle stand and shake away 
flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,Where the cheese-cloth 
hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where 
cob- webs fall in festoons from the rafters,Where trip-hammers crash, 
where the press is whirling its cylinders,Wherever the human heart 
beats with terrible throes out of its ribs,Where the pear-shaped 
balloon is floating aloft, floating in it myself and looking 
composedly down,Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where 
the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,Where the 
she-whale swims with her calves and never forsakes them,Where the 
steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,Where the ground-shark's 
fin cuts like a black chip out of the water,Where 
the half-burned brig is riding on unknown currents,Where shells grow 
to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below,Where 
the striped and starred flag is borne at the head
