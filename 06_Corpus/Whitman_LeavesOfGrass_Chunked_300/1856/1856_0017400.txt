hut, and the Dahoman and Ashantee-man in their huts,I see 
the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo, I see the picturesque 
crowds at the fairs of Khiva, and those of Herat,I 
see Teheran, I see Muscat and Medina, and the intervening 
sands—I see the caravans toil- ing onward;I see Egypt and 
the Egyptians, I see the pyramids and obelisks,I look on 
chiselled histories, songs, philosophies, cut in slabs of sand-stone or 
granite blocks,I see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mum- mies, embalmed, 
swathed in linen cloth, lying there many centuries,I look on 
the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping neck, the 
hands folded across the breast.I see the menials of the 
earth, laboring, I see the prisoners in the prisons, I 
see the defective human bodies of the earth, I see 
the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunch- backs, lunatics,I 
see the pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-makers of the earth,I 
see the helpless infants, and the helpless old men and 
women.I see male and female everywhere, I see the serene 
brotherhood of philosophs, I see the constructiveness of my race, 
I see the results of the perseverance and industry of 
my race,I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations—I go among them, 
I mix indiscriminately,And I salute all the inhabitants of the 
earth. You, inevitable where you are! You daughter or son 
of England! You free man of Australia! you of Tasmania! 
you of Papua! you free woman of the same!You of 
the mighty Slavic tribes and empires! you Russ in Russia!You 
dim-descended, black, divine-souled African, large, fine-headed, nobly-formed, superbly destined, on 
equal terms with me!You Norwegian! Swede! Dane! Icelander! you Prussian!You 
Spaniard of Spain! you Portuguese! You Frenchwoman and Frenchman of 
France! You Belge! you liberty-lover of the Netherlands! You sturdy
