their work,The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,The 
great speakers and writers are exiled—they lie sick in distant 
lands,The cause is asleep—the strong throats are choked with their 
own blood,The young men drop their eye-lashes toward the ground 
when they meet,But for all this, liberty has not gone 
out of the place, nor the infidel entered into pos-

the first to go, nor the second or third to 
go,It waits for all the rest to go—it is the 
last. When there are no more memories of the lovers 
of the whole of the nations of the world,The lovers' 
names scouted in the public gatherings by the lips of 
the orators,Boys not christened after them, but christened after traitors 
and murderers instead,Laws for slaves sweet to the taste of 
people — the slave-hunt acknowledged,You or I walking abroad upon 
the earth, elated at the sight of slaves, no matter 
who they are,And when all life and all the souls 
of men and women are discharged from any part of 
the earth,Then shall the instinct of liberty be discharged from 
that part of the earth,Then shall the infidel and the 
tyrant come into possession. 271 22 — Poem of Apparitions

way there, Jonathan!Way for the President's marshal! Way for the 
government cannon!Way for the federal foot and dragoons—and the apparitions 
copiously tumbling.I rose this morning early to get betimes in 
Boston town,Here's a good place at the corner, I must 
stand and see the show.I love to look on the 
stars and stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee 
Doodle.How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!Every man 
holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.A fog follows,
