and his cattle,The fare-collector goes through the train, he gives 
notice by the jingling of loose change,The floor-men are laying 
the floor—the tinners are tinning the roof—the masons are calling 
for mortar,In single file, each shouldering his hod, pass on- 
ward the laborers,Seasons pursuing each other, the indescribable crowd is 
gathered—it is the Fourth of July —what salutes of cannon 
and small arms!Seasons pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the 
mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground,Off on 
the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole 
in the frozen surface,The stumps stand thick round the clearing, 
the squatter strikes deep with his axe,Flatboatmen make fast toward 
dusk near the cot- ton-wood or pekan-trees,Coon-seekers go through the 
regions of the Red river, or through those drained by 
the Ten- nessee, or through those of the Arkansaw,Torches shine 
in the dark that hangs on the Chat- tahoochee or 
Altamahaw,Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons 
around them,In walls of adobe, in canvass tents, rest hunters 
and trappers after their day's sport,The city sleeps and the 
country sleeps, The living sleep for their time, the dead 
sleep for their time.The old husband sleeps by his wife, 
and the young husband sleeps by his wife;And these one 
and all tend inward to me, and I tend outward 
to them,And such as it is to be of these, 
more or less, I am. I am of old and 
young, of the foolish as much as the wise,Regardless of 
others, ever regardful of others, Maternal as well as paternal, 
a child as well as a man,Stuffed with the stuff 
that is coarse, and stuffed with the stuff that is 
fine,One of the great nation, the nation of many nations, 
the smallest the same, the largest the same,A southerner soon
