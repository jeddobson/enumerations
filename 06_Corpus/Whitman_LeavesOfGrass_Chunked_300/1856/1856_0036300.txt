smiling, form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the 
skull-bones,Under the broad-cloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial 
flowers,Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of 
itself,Speaking of anything else, but never of itself. Allons! through

have tried it—my own feet have tried it well.Allons! be 
not detained! Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, 
and the book on the shelf unopened!Let the tools remain 
in the work-shop! let the money remain unearned!Let the school 
stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!Let the preacher

court, and the judge expound the law!Mon enfant! I give 
you my hand! I give you my love, more precious 
than money, I give you myself, before preaching or law; 
Will you give me yourself? Will you come travel with 
me?Shall we stick by each other as long as we 
live? 240 13 — Poem of Procreation. A WOMAN waits

right man were lacking.Sex contains all, Bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, 
purities, delica- cies, results, promulgations,Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal 
mystery, the semitic milk,All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, All the passions,
