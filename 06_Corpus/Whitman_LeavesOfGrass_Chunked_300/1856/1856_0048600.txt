countenance,From the open countenances of animals, from in- animate things,From 
the landscape or waters, or from the exqui- site apparition 
of the sky,From our own countenances, mine and yours, faithfully 
returning them,Every day in public appearing without fail, but never 
twice with the same companions.Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the 
three hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the sun,Embracing all, soothing, 
supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty-five offsets of the 
first, sure and necessary as they.Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading, 
Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,The soul's realization 
and determination still in- heriting,The liquid vacuum around and ahead 
still entering and dividing,No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on 
no rock striking,Swift, glad, content, unbereaved, nothing losing, Of all 
able and ready at any time to give strict account,The 
divine ship sails the divine sea. Whoever you are! motion 
and reflection are espe- cially for you,The divine ship sails 
the divine sea for you. Whoever you are! you are 
he or she for whom the earth is solid and 
liquid,You are he or she for whom the sun and 
moon hang in the sky,For none more than you are 
the present and the past,For none more than you is 
immortality. Each man to himself, and each woman to herself, 
is the word of the past and present, and theword 
of immortality, Not one can acquire for another—not one! Not 
one can grow for another—not one! The song is to 
the singer, and comes back most to him,The teaching is 
to the teacher, and comes back most to him,The murder 
is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,The 
theft is to the thief, and comes back most to 
him,The love is to the lover, and comes back most 
to him,The gift is to the giver, and comes back
