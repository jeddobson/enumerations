the celestial sphere where every one goes in his turn.I 
see the battle-fields of the earth—grass grows upon them, and 
blossoms and corn,I see the tracks of ancient and modern 
expedi- tions.I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the 
unknown events, heroes, records of the earth.I see the places

nets, lying off the shore of Paumanok, quite still,I see 
ten fishermen waiting—they discover now a thick school of mossbonkers, 
they drop the joined seine-ends in the water,The boats separate,
