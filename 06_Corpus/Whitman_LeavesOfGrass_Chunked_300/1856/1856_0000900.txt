I like, the hum of your valved voice. I mind 
how we lay in June, such a transparent summer morning,You 
settled your head athwart my hips, and gently turned over 
upon me,And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged 
your tongue to my bare-stript heart,And reached till you felt 
my beard, and reached till you held my feet.Swiftly arose 
and spread around me the peace and joy and knowledge 
that pass all the art and argument of the earth,And 
I know that the hand of God is the promise 
of my own,And I know that the spirit of God 
is the brother of my own,And that all the men 
ever born are also my bro- thers, and the women 
my sisters and lovers,And that a kelson of the creation 
is love, And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in 
the fields,And brown ants in the little wells beneath them, 
And mossy scabs of the worm-fence, heaped stones, elder, mullen, 
pokeweed.A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to 
me with full hands;How could I answer the child? I 
do not know what it is any more than he.I 
guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out 
of hopeful green stuff woven.Or I guess it is the 
handkerchief of the Lord, A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly 
dropped,Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we 
may see and remark, and say Whose?Or I guess the 
grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the 
vegetation.Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, And it 
means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,Growing among 
black folks as among white, Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I 
give them the same, I receive them the same.And now 
it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.Tenderly
