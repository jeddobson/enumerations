for traveling souls!The soul travels, The body does not travel 
as much as the soul, The body has just as 
great a work as the soul, and parts away at 
last for the journeys of the soul.All parts away for 
the progress of souls, All religion, all solid things, arts,

streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors,In 
the cars of rail-roads, in steam-boats, in the public assembly,Home 
to the houses of men and women, among their families, 
at the table, in the bed-room, every where,Smartly attired, countenance
