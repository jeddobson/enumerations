feet, they are licked by the indolent waves,I am exposed, 
cut by bitter and poisoned hail, Steeped amid honeyed morphine, 
my windpipe squeezed in the fakes of death,Let up again 
to feel the puzzle of puzzles, And that we call 
Being. To be in any form, what is that? If 
nothing lay more developed, the quahaug in its callous shell 
were enough.Mine is no callous shell, I have instant conductors 
all over me, whether I pass or stop,They seize every 
object and lead it harmlessly through me.I merely stir, press, 
feel with my fingers, and am happy,To touch my person 
to some one else's is about as much as I 
can stand.Is this then a touch? quivering me to a 
new identity,Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, 
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,My 
flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is 
hardly different from myself,On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my 
limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving 
licentious toward me, taking no denial, Depriving me of my 
best, as for a purpose, Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me 
by the bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of 
the sun-light and pasture-fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, They bribed 
to swap off with touch, and go and graze at 
the edges of me,No consideration, no regard for my draining 
strength or my anger,Fetching the rest of the herd around 
to enjoy them awhile,Then all uniting to stand on a 
head-land and worry me.The sentries desert every other part of 
me, They have left me helpless to a red marauder, 
They all come to the head-land, to witness and assist 
against me.I am given up by traitors! I talk wildly, 
I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
