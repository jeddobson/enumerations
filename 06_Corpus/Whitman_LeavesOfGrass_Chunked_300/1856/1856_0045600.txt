They show their descent from the Master himself.Off the word 
I have spoken I except not one — red, white, 
black, all are deific,In each house is the ovum, it 
comes forth after a thousand years.Spots or cracks at the

the distaff and the wheel.The melodious character of the earth! 
The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not
