poet of wickedness also.Washes and razors for foofoos—for me freckles 
and a bristling beard.What blurt is this about virtue and 
about vice? Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels 
me — I stand indifferent,My gait is no fault-finder's or 
rejecter's gait, I moisten the roots of all that has

seas,This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and 
this is a mathematician.Gentlemen, I receive you and attach and 
clasp hands with you,The facts are useful and real—they are 
not my dwelling—I enter by them to an area of
