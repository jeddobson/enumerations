rich, boys apprenticed to trades,Young fellows working on farms, and 
old fellows working on farms,The naive, the simple and hardy, 
he going to the polls to vote, he who has 
a good time, and he who has a bad time,Mechanics, 
southerners, new arrivals, laborers sailors, mano'warsmen, merchantmen, coast- ers,All these 
I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,None 
shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me.I 
bring what you much need, yet always have, Not money, 
amours, dress, eating, but as good, I send no agent 
or medium, offer no representative of value, but offer the 
value itself.There is something that comes home to one now 
and perpetually,It is not what is printed, preached, discussed—it eludes 
discussion and print,It is not to be put in a 
book, it is not in this book,It is for you, 
whoever you are—it is no farther from you than your 
hearing and sight are from you,It is hinted by nearest, 
commonest, readiest—it is not them, though it is endlessly provoked 
by them—what is there ready and near you now?You may 
read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,You may 
read the President's message, and read nothing about it there,Nothing 
in the reports from the State department or Treasury department, 
or in the daily papers or the weekly papers,Or in 
the census returns, assessors' returns, prices current, or any accounts 
of stock.The sun and stars that float in the open 
air—the apple-shaped earth, and we upon it, surely the drift 
of them is something grand!I do not know what it 
is, except that it is grand, and that it is 
happiness,And that the enclosing purport of us here is not 
a speculation, or bon-mot, or recon- noissance,And that it is 
not something which by luck may turn out well for
