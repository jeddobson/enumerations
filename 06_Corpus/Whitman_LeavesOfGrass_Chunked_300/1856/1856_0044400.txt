sat and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the 
audience,The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the 
red squaw,The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is 
wronged,The antipodes, and every one between this and them in 
the dark,I swear they are averaged now—one is no better 
than the other,The night and sleep have likened them and 
re- tored them.I swear they are all beautiful! Every one 
that sleeps is beautiful—every thing in the dim light is

in its place;The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten 
blood waits,The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, 
and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the 
drunkard himself waits long,The sleepers that lived and died wait—the 
far advanced are to go on in their turns, and 
the far behind are to go on in their turns,The 
diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow 
and unite—they unite now.The sleepers are very beautiful as they 
lie unclothed,They flow hand in hand over the whole earth 
from east to west as they lie unclothed,The Asiatic and 
African are hand in hand, the European and American are
