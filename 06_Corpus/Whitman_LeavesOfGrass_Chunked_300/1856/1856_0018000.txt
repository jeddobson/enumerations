deformed persons, idiots! You human forms with the fathomless ever- 
impressive countenances of brutes!You poor koboo whom the meanest of 
the rest look down upon, for all your glimmering language 
and spirituality!You low expiring aborigines of the hills of Utah, 
Oregon, California!You dwarfed Kamskatkan, Greenlander, Lapp! You Austral negro, naked,

light or warmth penetrates, I penetrate those cities myself,All islands 
to which birds wing their way, I wing my way 
myself,I find my home wherever there are any homes of 
men. 121 4 — Poem of The Daily Work of 
The Workmen and Workwomen of These States. COME closer to 
me, Push close, my lovers, and take the best I 
possess,Yield closer and closer, and give me the best you 
possess.This is unfinished business with me—How is it with you?I
