fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also,You 
furnish your parts toward eternity, Great or small, you furnish 
your parts toward the soul. 223 12 — Poem of 
The Road. A FOOT and light-hearted I take to the 
open road!Healthy, free, the world before me! The long brown 
path before me, leading wherever I choose!Henceforth I ask not 
good-fortune, I am good- fortune,Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone 
no more, need nothing,Strong and content, I travel the open 
road. The earth—that is sufficient, I do not want the 
constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where 
they are, I know they suffice for those who belong 
to them. Still here I carry my old delicious burdens, 
I carry them, men and women—I carry them with me 
wherever I go,I swear it is impossible for me to 
get rid of them, I am filled with them, and 
I will fill them in return.You road I travel and 
look around! I believe you are not all that is 
here!I believe that something unseen is also here. Here is

person, are not de- nied,The birth, the hasting after the 
physician, the beggar's tramp, the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party 
of mechanics,The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, 
the eloping couple,The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of 
furniture into the town, the return back from the town,They 
pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be 
interdicted,None but are accepted, none but are dear to me. 
You air that serves me with breath to speak! You 
objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them 
shape!You light that wraps me and all things in delicate
