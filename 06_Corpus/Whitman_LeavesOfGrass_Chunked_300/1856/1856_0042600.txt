Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noise- lessly stepping and 
stopping,Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,Wandering 
and confused, lost to myself, ill- assorted, contradictory,Pausing, gazing, bending, 
stopping. How solemn they look there, stretched and still! How 
quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles!The wretched 
features of ennuyees, the white features of corpses, the livid 
faces of drunk- ards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,The gashed 
bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-doored rooms, the

money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,And the enraged and treacherous 
dispositions sleep.I stand with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and 
restless,I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few

earth recedes from me into the night, I saw that 
it was beautiful, and I see that what is not 
the earth is beautiful.I go from bedside to bedside, I 
sleep close with the other sleepers, each in turn,I dream 
in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,And
