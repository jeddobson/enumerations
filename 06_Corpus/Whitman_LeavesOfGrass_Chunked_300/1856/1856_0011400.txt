I buoy you up,Every room of the house do I 
fill with an armed force, lovers of me, bafflers of 
graves,Sleep! I and they keep guard all night, Not doubt, 
not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,I have 
embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,And when you

for him there with his rolled-up sleeves, driving the mallet 
and chisel,Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of 
smoke or a hair on the back of my hand 
just as curious as any revelation,Those ahold of fire-engines and
