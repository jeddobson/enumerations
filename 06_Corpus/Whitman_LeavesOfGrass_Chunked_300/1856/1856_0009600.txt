happy,White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads 
are bared of their fire-caps,The kneeling crowd fades with the 
light of the torches.Distant and dead resuscitate, They show as 
the dial or move as the hands of me—I am 
the clock myself.I am an old artillerist, I tell of 
my fort's bombard- ment, I am there again.Again the reveille

they took in advance,Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition 
gone,They treated for an honorable capitulation, re- ceived writing and 
seal, gave up their arms, marched back prisoners of war.They 
were the glory of the race of rangers, Matchless with 
horse, rifle, song, supper, court- ship,Large, turbulent, brave, handsome, generous, 
proud, affectionate,Bearded, sunburnt, dressed in the free costume of hunters,Not 
a single one over thirty years of age. The second 
Sunday morning they were brought out in squads and massacred—it
