do not;)Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch'd and choked,Beneath this 
face that appears so impassive, hell's tides continually run, Lusts 
and wickedness are acceptable to me,I walk with delinquents with 
passionate love,I feel I am of them—I belong to those 
convicts and prostitutes myself, And henceforth I will not deny 
them—for how can I deny myself? 14.UNFOLDED out of the 
folds of the woman, man comes unfolded, as is always 
to come unfolded, Unfolded only out of the superbest woman 
of the earth, is to come the superbest man of 
the earth, Unfolded out of the friendliest woman, is to 
come the friendliest man, Unfolded only out of the perfect 
body of a woman, can a man be formed of 
perfect body, Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of 
the woman, can come the poems of man—only thence have 
my poems come, Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant 
woman I love, only thence can appear the strong and 
arrogant man I love, Unfolded by brawny embraces from the 
well-muscled woman I love, only thence come the brawny embraces 
of the man, Unfolded out of the folds of the 
woman's brain, come all the folds of the man's brain, 
duly obedient, Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, 
all justice is unfolded, Unfolded out of the sympathy of 
the woman is all sympathy; A man is a great 
thing upon the earth, and through eternity—but every jot of 
the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman, First 
the man is shaped in the woman, he can then 
be shaped in himself. 15.1 NIGHT on the Prairies;I walk 
by myself—I stand and look at the stars, which I 
think now I never realized before. 2 Now I absorb 
immortality and peace,I admire death and test propositions.3 How plenteous!
