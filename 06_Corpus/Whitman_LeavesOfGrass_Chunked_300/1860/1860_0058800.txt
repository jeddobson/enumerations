not be obedient to its organs,I become a dumb man.29 
The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow—all or 
any is best, It is not what you anticipated—it is 
cheaper, easier, nearer, Things are not dismissed from the places 
they held before, The earth is just as positive and 
direct as it was before, Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, 
are as real as before, But the Soul is also 
real,—it too is positive and direct, No reasoning, no proof 
has established it,Undeniable growth has established it.30 This is a 
poem for the sayers of words—these are hints of meanings, 
These are they that echo the tones of Souls, and 
the phrases of Souls; If they did not echo the 
phrases of Souls, what were they then? If they had 
not reference to you in especial, what were they then? 
31 I swear I will never henceforth have to do 
with the faith that tells the best! I will have 
to do with that faith only that leaves the best 
untold. 32 Say on, sayers!Delve! mould! pile the words of 
the earth!Work on—it is materials you bring, not breaths;Work on, 
age after age! nothing is to be lost,It may have 
to wait long, but it will certainly come in use, 
When the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear. 
33 I swear to you the architects shall appear without 
fail! I announce them and lead them, I swear to 
you they will understand you and justify you, I swear 
to you the greatest among them shall be he who 
best knows you, and encloses all, and is faithful to 
all, I swear to you, he and the rest shall 
not forget you —they shall perceive that you are not 
an iota less than they, I swear to you, you
