geologist, phrenologist, artist— all these underlie the maker of poems. 
7 The words of poems give you more than poems,They 
give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war, 
peace, behavior, histories, essays, romances, and everything else, They balance 
ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes, They do not 
seek beauty—they are sought,Forever touching them, or close upon them, 
follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick. 8 They prepare for death—yet 
are they not the finish, but rather the outset, They 
bring none to his or her terminus, or to be 
con- tent and full; Whom they take, they take into 
space, to behold the birth of stars, to learn one 
of the meanings, To launch off with absolute faith—to sweep 
through the ceaseless rings, and never be quiet again. 7.I 
NEED no assurances—I am a man who is pre- occupied, 
of his own Soul; I do not doubt that whatever 
I know at a given time, there waits for me 
more, which I do not know; I do not doubt 
that from under the feet, and beside the hands and 
face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I 
am not cognizant of—calm and actual faces; I do not 
doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are 
latent in any iota of the world; I do not 
doubt there are realizations I have no idea of, waiting 
for me through time, and through the universes—also upon this 
earth; I do not doubt I am limitless, and that 
the universes are limitless—in vain I try to think how 
limitless; I do not doubt that the orbs, and the 
systems of orbs, play their swift sports through the air 
on purpose —and that I shall one day be eligible 
to do as much as they, and more than they;
