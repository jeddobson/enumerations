every one of you—I know the unspoken interrogatories, By experience 
I know them.291 How the flukes splash!How they contort, rapid 
as lightning, with spasms, and spouts of blood! 292 Be 
at peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers, I 
take my place among you as much as among any,The 
past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the 
same, Day and night are for you, me, all,And what 
is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, 
precisely the same. 293 I do not know what is 
untried and afterward,But I know it is sure, alive, sufficient.294 
Each who passes is considered—Each who stops is considered—Not a 
single one can it fail. 295 It cannot fail the 
young man who died and was buried, Nor the young 
woman who died and was put by his side, Nor 
the little child that peeped in at the door, and 
then drew back, and was never seen again, Nor the 
old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it 
with bitterness worse than gall, Nor him in the poor-house, 
tubercled by rum and the bad disorder, Nor the numberless 
slaughtered and wrecked—nor the brutish koboo called the ordure of 
humanity, Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for 
food to slip in, Nor anything in the earth, or 
down in the oldest graves of the earth, Nor anything 
in the myriads of spheres—nor one of the myriads of 
myriads that inhabit them, Nor the present—nor the least wisp 
that is known.296 It is time to explain myself—Let us 
stand up.297 What is known I strip away,I launch all 
men and women forward with me into THE UNKNOWN. 298 
The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate? 299 
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
