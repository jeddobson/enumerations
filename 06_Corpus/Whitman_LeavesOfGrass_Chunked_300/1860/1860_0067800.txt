I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; 
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who 
lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; Fly on, 
sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in 
the air; Receive the summer-sky, you water! and faithfully hold 
it, till all downcast eyes have time to take it 
from you; Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape 
of my head, or any one's head, in the sun-lit 
water; Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up 
or down, white-sailed schooners, sloops, lighters! Flaunt away, flags of 
all nations! be duly lowered at sunset; Burn high your 
fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red 
and yellow light over the tops of the houses; Appearances, 
now or henceforth, indicate what you are; You necessary film, 
continue to envelop the Soul;About my body for me, and 
your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas; Thrive, 
cities! bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient 
rivers; Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more 
spiritual; Keep your places, objects than which none else is 
more lasting. 25 We descend upon you and all things—we 
arrest you all, We realize the Soul only by you, 
you faithful solids and fluids, Through you color, form, location, 
sublimity, ideality,Through you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions 
and determinations of ourselves. 26 You have waited, you always 
wait, you dumb, beauti- ful ministers! you novices! We receive 
you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, 
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, 
or with- hold yourselves from us, We use you, and 
do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, 
We fathom you not—we love you—there is per- fection in
