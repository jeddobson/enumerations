orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, 
shall we be filled and satisfied then? And my Spirit 
said No, we level that lift, to pass and continue

hear you,I answer that I cannot answer—you must find out 
for yourself. 331 Sit a while, wayfarer,Here are biscuits to 
eat, and here is milk to drink,But as soon as

to sail a skiff, to sing a song, or play 
on the banjo, Preferring scars, and faces pitted with small-pox, 
over all latherers, and those that keep out of the 
sun. 336 I teach straying from me—yet who can stray
