precious love— the anguish—the patiently yielded life. 11 O the 
joy of increase, growth, recuperation,The joy of soothing and pacifying—the 
joy of concord and harmony. 12 O to go back 
to the place where I was born!O to hear the 
birds sing once more!To ramble about the house and barn, 
and over the fields, once more, And through the orchard 
and along the old lanes once more. 13 O male 
and female!O the presence of women! (I swear, nothing is 
more exquisite to me than the presence of women;) O 
for the girl, my mate! O for happiness with my 
mate! O the young man as I pass! O I 
am sick after the friendship of him who, I fear, 
is indifferent to me. 14 O the streets of cities!The 
flitting faces—the expressions, eyes, feet, cos- tumes! O I cannot 
tell how welcome they are to me; O of men—of 
women toward me as I pass—The memory of only one 
look—the boy lingering and waiting. 15 O to have been 
brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast! 
O to continue and be employed there all my life!O 
the briny and damp smell—the shore—the salt weeds exposed at 
low water, The work of fishermen—the work of the eel-fisher 
and clam-fisher. 16 O it is I!I come with my 
clam-rake and spade! I come with my eel-spear; Is the 
tide out? I join the group of clam-diggers on the 
flats, I laugh and work with them—I joke at my 
work, like a mettlesome young man. 17 In winter I 
take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot 
on the ice—I have a small axe to cut holes 
in the ice; Behold me, well-clothed, going gayly, or returning 
in the afternoon—my brood of tough boys accom- panying me,
