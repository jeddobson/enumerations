hills, old limpers! I do not think you belong here, 
anyhow.12 But there is one thing that belongs here—shall I 
tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston? 13 I 
will whisper it to the Mayor—he shall send a com- 
mittee to England, They shall get a grant from the 
Parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault—haste! Dig 
out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes, 
box up his bones for a journey, Find a swift 
Yankee clipper—here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper, Up with 
your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward Boston 
bay. 14 Now call for the President's marshal again, bring 
out the government cannon, Fetch home the roarers from Congress, 
make an- other procession, guard it with foot and dra- 
goons. 15 This centre-piece for them:Look! all orderly citizens—look from 
the windows, women! 16 The committee open the box, set 
up the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay, 
Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap 
a crown on top of the skull. 17 You have 
got your revenge, old buster! The crown is come to 
its own, and more than its own. 18 Stick your 
hands in your pockets, Jonathan—you are a made man from

your bargains. 341 CALAMUS. 1.IN paths untrodden,In the growth by 
margins of pond-waters,Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,From all

me now, standards not yet published— clear to me that 
my Soul, That the Soul of the man I speak 
for, feeds, rejoices only in comrades; Here, by myself, away 
from the clank of the world,Tallying and talked to here
