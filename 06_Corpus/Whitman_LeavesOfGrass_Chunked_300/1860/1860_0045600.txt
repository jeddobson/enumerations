in mines, or forging iron!Foundry casting—the foundry itself—the rude high 
roof—the ample and shadowed space, The furnace—the hot liquid poured 
out and running.23 O the joys of the soldier!To feel 
the presence of a brave general! to feel his sympathy! 
To behold his calmness! to be warmed in the rays 
of his smile! To go to battle! to hear the 
bugles play, and the drums beat! To hear the artillery! 
to see the glittering of the bay- onets and musket-barrels 
in the sun! To see men fall and die and 
not complain!To taste the savage taste of blood! to be 
so devilish!To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of 
the enemy.24 O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my 
old cruise again! I feel the ship's motion under me—I 
feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me, I hear the cry 
again sent down from the mast-head, There she blows, Again 
I spring up the rigging, to look with the rest— 
We see—we descend, wild with excitement, I leap in the 
lowered boat—We row toward our prey, where he lies, We 
approach, stealthy and silent—I see the moun- tainous mass, lethargic, 
basking, I see the harpooner standing up—I see the weapon 
dart from his vigorous arm; O swift, again, now, far 
out in the ocean, the wounded whale, settling, running to 
windward, tows me, Again I see him rise to breathe—We 
row close again, I see a lance driven through his 
side, pressed deep, turned in the wound, Again we back 
off—I see him settle again—the life is leaving him fast, 
As he rises, he spouts blood—I see him swim in 
cir- cles narrower and narrower, swiftly cutting the water—I see 
him die, He gives one convulsive leap in the centre 
of the cir- cle, and then falls flat and still
