the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,The cheating look, 
the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, Refusals, hates, 
postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting. 17 But I 
was a Manhattanese, free, friendly, and proudI was called by 
my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men 
as they saw me approaching or passing, Felt their arms 
on my neck as I stood, or the neg- ligent

to know what should come home to me?Who knows but 
I am enjoying this?Who knows but I am as good 
as looking at you now, for all you cannot see 
me? 20 It is not you alone, nor I alone,Not 
a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few 
centuries, It is that each came, or comes, or shall 
come, from its due emission, without fail, either now, or 
then, or henceforth. 21 Every thing indicates—the smallest does, and 
the largest does, A necessary film envelops all, and envelops 
the Soul for a proper time. 22 Now I am 
curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable
