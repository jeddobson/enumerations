with any one I love—or sleep in the bed at 
night with any one I love, Or sit at the 
table at dinner with my mother,Or look at strangers opposite 
me riding in the car,Or watch honey-bees busy around the 
hive, of a sum- mer forenoon, Or animals feeding in 
the fields,Or birds—or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,Or 
the wonderfulness of the sun-down—or of stars shining so quiet 
and bright, Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the 
new-moon in spring; Or whether I go among those I 
like best, and that like me best—mechanics, boatmen, farmers, Or 
among the savans—or to the soiree—or to the opera, Or 
stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery, 
Or behold children at their sports,Or the admirable sight of 
the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman, Or 
the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,Or 
my own eyes and figure in the glass,These, with the 
rest, one and all, are to me miracles,The whole referring—yet 
each distinct and in its place. 4 To me, every 
hour of the light and dark is miracle,Every inch of 
space is a miracle,Every square yard of the surface of 
the earth is spread with the same, Every cubic foot 
of the interior swarms with the same;Every spear of grass—the 
frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all that 
concerns them, All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.5 
To me the sea is a continual miracle,The fishes that 
swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—the ships, with men in 
them, What stranger miracles are there? 9.1 THERE was a 
child went forth every day,And the first object he looked 
upon and received with wonder, pity, love, or dread, that 
object he became, And that object became part of him
