toward a real heroic man? Have you no thought, O 
dreamer, that it may be all maya, illusion? O the 
next step may precipitate you! O let some past deceived 
one hiss in your ears, how many have prest on 
the same as you are pressing now, How many have 
fondly supposed what you are sup- posing now—only to be 
disappointed. 13.CALAMUS taste,(For I must change the strain—these are not 
to be pensive leaves, but leaves of joy,) Roots and 
leaves unlike any but themselves,Scents brought to men and women 
from the wild woods, and from the pond-side, Breast-sorrel and 
pinks of love—fingers that wind around tighter than vines, Gushes 
from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of 
trees, as the sun is risen, Breezes of land and 
love—Breezes set from living shores out to you on the 
living sea—to you, O sailors! Frost-mellowed berries, and Third Month 
twigs, of- fered fresh to young persons wandering out in 
the fields when the winter breaks up, Love-buds, put before 
you and within you, whoever you are, Buds to be 
unfolded on the old terms,If you bring the warmth of 
the sun to them, they will open, and bring form, 
color, perfume, to you, If you become the aliment and 
the wet, they will become flowers, fruits, tall branches and 
trees, They are comprised in you just as much as 
in them- selves—perhaps more than in themselves, They are not 
comprised in one season or succession, but many successions, They 
have come slowly up out of the earth and me, 
and are to come slowly up out of you. 14.NOT 
heat flames up and consumes,Not sea-waves hurry in and out,Not 
the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe 
summer, bears lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,
