as they are to you, I project myself a moment 
to tell you—also I return. 10 I loved well those 
cities,I loved well the stately and rapid river,The men and 
women I saw were all near to me,Others the same—others 
who look back on me, because I looked forward to 
them, (The time will come, though I stop here to-day

too knitted the old knot of contrariety,Blabbed, blushed, resented, lied, 
stole, grudged,Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not 
speak,Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, The wolf,
