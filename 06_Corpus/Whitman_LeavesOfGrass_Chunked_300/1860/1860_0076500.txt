I hid, I advance per- sonally. 20 This is no 
book,Who touches this, touches a man,(Is it night? Are we 
here alone?)It is I you hold, and who holds you,I 
spring from the pages into your arms—decease calls me forth. 
21 O how your fingers drowse me!Your breath falls around 
me like dew—your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears, 
I feel immerged from head to foot,Delicious—enough.22 Enough, O deed 
impromptu and secret!Enough, O gliding present! Enough, O summed-up past! 
23 Dear friend, whoever you are, here, take this kiss,I 
give it especially to you—Do not forget me,I feel like 
one who has done his work—I progress on,The unknown sphere, 
more real than I dreamed, more direct, darts awakening rays 
about me— So long! Remember my words—I love you—I depart 
from materials, I am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.
