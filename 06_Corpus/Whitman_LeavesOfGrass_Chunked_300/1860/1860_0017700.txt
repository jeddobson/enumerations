to States whose semitic impulses send whole- some children to 
the next age! But damn that which spends itself on 
flaunters and dalliers, with no thought of the stain, pains, 
dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing. 20 By great bards only 
can series of peoples and States be fused into the 
compact organism of one nation. 21 To hold men together 
by paper and seal, or by com- pulsion, is no 
account, That only holds men together which is living prin- 
ciples, as the hold of the limbs of the body, 
or the fibres of plants. 22 Of all races and 
eras, These States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most 
need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use 
them the greatest, Their Presidents shall not be their common 
referee so much as their poets shall. 23 Of mankind, 
the poet is the equable man,Not in him, but off 
from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full 
returns, Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in 
its place is bad, He bestows on every object or 
quality its fit propor- tions, neither more nor less, He 
is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,He 
is the equalizer of his age and land,He supplies what 
wants supplying—he checks what wants checking, In peace, out of 
him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building 
populous towns, encour- aging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study 
of man, the Soul, health, immortality, government, In war, he 
is the best backer of the war—he fetches artillery as 
good as the engineer's—he can make every word he speaks 
draw blood; The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by 
his steady faith, He is no arguer, he is judgment,He 
judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun
