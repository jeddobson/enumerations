a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night. 
105 I know I am august,I do not trouble my 
spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, I see that 
the elementary laws never apologize,I reckon I behave no prouder 
than the level I plant my house by, after all. 
106 I exist as I am—that is enough,If no other 
in the world be aware, I sit content,And if each 
and all be aware, I sit content.107 One world is 
aware, and by far the largest to me, and that 
is myself, And whether I come to my own to-day, 
or in ten thousand or ten million years, I can 
cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerful- ness I 
can wait 108 My foothold is tenoned and mortised in 
granite,I laugh at what you call dissolution,And I know the 
amplitude of time.109 I am the poet of the body,And 
I am the poet of the Soul.110 The pleasures of 
heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are 
with me, The first I graft and increase upon myself—the 
latter I translate into a new tongue. 111 I am 
the poet of the woman the same as the man,And 
I say it is as great to be a woman 
as to be a man, And I say there is 
nothing greater than the mother of men. 112 I chant 
the chant of dilation or pride,We have had ducking and 
deprecating about enough,I show that size is only development.113 Have 
you outstript the rest? Are you the President?It is a 
trifle—they will more than arrive there every one, and still 
pass on. 114 I am He that walks with the 
tender and growing Night, I call to the earth and 
sea, half-held by the Night.115 Press close, bare-bosomed Night! Press
