special revelations—considering a curl of smoke or a hair on 
the back of my hand just as curious as any 
revelation, Those ahold of fire engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no 
less to me than the Gods of the antique wars, 
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction, Their 
brawny limbs passing safe over charred laths— their white foreheads 
whole and unhurt out of the flames; By the mechanic's 
wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every 
person born, Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row 
from three lusty angels with shirts bagged out at their 
waists, The snag-toothed hostler with red hair redeeming sins past 
and to come, Selling all he possesses, travelling on foot 
to fee lawyers for his brother, and sit by him 
while he is tried for forgery; What was strewn in 
the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not 
filling the square rod then, The bull and the bug 
never worshipped half enough,Dung and dirt more admirable than was 
dreamed,The supernatural of no account—myself waiting my time to be 
one of the Supremes, The day getting ready for me 
when I shall do as much good as the best, 
and be as prodigious, Guessing when I am it will 
not tickle me much to receive puffs out of pulpit 
or print; By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,Putting myself 
here and now to the ambushed womb of the shadows. 
277 A call in the midst of the crowd,My own 
voice, orotund, sweeping, final.278 Come my children,Come my boys and 
girls, my women, household, and intimates, Now the performer launches 
his nerve—he has passed his prelude on the reeds within. 
279 Easily written, loose-fingered chords! I feel the thrum of 
their climax and close. 280 My head slues round on
