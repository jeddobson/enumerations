you not sicken?How can you be alive, you growths of 
spring?How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, 
orchards, grain? Are they not continually putting distempered corpses in 
you? Is not every continent worked over and over with 
sour dead? 3 Where have you disposed of those carcasses 
of the drunkards and gluttons of so many generations? Where

yellow maize-stalk;The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all 
those strata of sour dead. 5 What chemistry!That the winds 
are really not infectious,That this is no cheat, this transparent 
green-wash of the sea, which is so amorous after me, 
That it is safe to allow it to lick my
