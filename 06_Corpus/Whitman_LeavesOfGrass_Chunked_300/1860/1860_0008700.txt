old tree and flows to the meadow, Where cattle stand 
and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their 
hides, Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen—Where andirons straddle 
the hearth-slab—Where cob- webs fall in festoons from the rafters, 
Where trip-hammers crash—Where the press is whirling its cylinders, Wherever

screams, weeps, Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard—Where the 
dry-stalks are scattered—Where the brood cow waits in the hovel,
