them also;) But for the fibre of things, and for 
inherent men and women. 3 Not to chisel ornaments,But to 
chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous 
Supreme Gods, that The States may realize them, walking and 
talking. 4 Let me have my own way,Let others promulge 
the laws—I will make no ac- count of the laws, 
Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace— I 
hold up agitation and conflict, I praise no eminent man—I 
rebuke to his face the one that was thought most 
worthy. 5 (Who are you? you mean devil! And what 
are you secretly guilty of, all your life? Will you 
turn aside all your life? Will you grub and chatter 
all your life?) 6 (And who are you—blabbing by rote, 
years, pages, languages, reminiscences, Unwitting to-day that you do not 
know how to speak a single word?) 7 Let others 
finish specimens—I never finish specimens,I shower them by exhaustless laws, 
as nature does, fresh and modern continually. 8 I give 
nothing as duties,What others give as duties, I give as 
living impulses;(Shall I give the heart's action as a duty?)9 
Let others dispose of questions—I dispose of noth- ing—I arouse 
unanswerable questions; Who are they I see and touch, and 
what about them?What about these likes of myself, that draw 
me so close by tender directions and indirections? 10 Let 
others deny the evil their enemies charge against them—but how 
can I the like? Nothing ever has been, or ever 
can be, charged against me, half as bad as the 
evil I really am; I call to the world to 
distrust the accounts of my friends, but listen to my 
enemies—as I my- self do; I charge you, too, forever, 
reject those who would expound me—for I cannot expound myself,
