still rise in the morn- ing, dejected, thinking who is 
lost to him? and at night, awaking, think who is 
lost? Does he too harbor his friendship silent and endless? 
harbor his anguish and passion? Does some stray reminder, or 
the casual mention of a name, bring the fit back 
upon him, taciturn and deprest? Does he see himself reflected 
in me? In these hours, does he see the face 
of his hours reflected? 10.YOU bards of ages hence! when 
you refer to me, mind not so much my poems, 
Nor speak of me that I prophesied of The States, 
and led them the way of their glories; But come, 
I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior—I will 
tell you what to say of me: Publish my name 
and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest 
lover, The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, 
his lover, was fondest, Who was not proud of his 
songs, but of the measure- less ocean of love within 
him—and freely poured it forth, Who often walked lonesome walks, 
thinking of his dear friends, his lovers, Who pensive, away 
from one he loved, often lay sleep- less and dissatisfied 
at night, Who knew too well the sick, sick dread 
lest the one he loved might secretly be indifferent to 
him, Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in 
woods, on hills, he and another, wandering hand in hand, 
they twain, apart from other men, Who oft as he 
sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the shoulder of 
his friend—while the arm of his friend rested upon him 
also. 11.WHEN I heard at the close of the day 
how my name had been received with plaudits in the 
capitol, still it was not a happy night for me
