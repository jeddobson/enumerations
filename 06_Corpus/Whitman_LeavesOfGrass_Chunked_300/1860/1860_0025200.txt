the lodge-hut in the woods, the still-hunt, City and country, 
fire-place, candle, gas-light, heater, aqueduct, The message of the Governor,

T rail for railroads, Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar- house, 
steam-saws, the great mills and factories, Lead-mines, and all that 
is done in lead-mines, or with the lead afterward, Copper-mines,
