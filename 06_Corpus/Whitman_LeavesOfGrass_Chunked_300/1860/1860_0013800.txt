spot with my Soul.312 O span of youth! Ever-pushed elasticity!O 
manhood, balanced, florid, and full.313 My lovers suffocate me!Crowding my 
lips, thick in the pores of my skin,Jostling me through 
streets and public halls— coming naked to me at night, 
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river 
—swinging and chirping over my head, Calling my name from 
flower-beds, vines, tangled under-brush, Or while I swim in the

upon their sur- faces, and all the palpable life, were 
this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would 
not avail in the long run, We should surely bring 
up again where we now stand, And as surely go 
as much farther—and then farther and farther. 320 A few
