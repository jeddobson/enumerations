wonders of city and country, and others taking great interest 
in them—and we taking no interest in them! 9 To 
think how eager we are in building our houses!To think 
others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent! 
10 I see one building the house that serves him 
a few years, or seventy or eighty years at most, 
I see one building the house that serves him longer 
than that. 11 Slow-moving and black lines creep over the 
whole earth—they never cease—they are the burial lines, He that 
was President was buried, and he that is now President 
shall surely be buried. 12 Cold dash of waves at 
the ferry-wharf—posh and ice in the river, half-frozen mud in 
the streets, a gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last 
daylight of Twelfth Month, A hearse and stages—other vehicles give 
place— the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cortege 
mostly drivers. 13 Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly 
rattles the death-bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug grave 
is halted at, the living alight, the hearse un- closes, 
The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the whip 
is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled 
in, The mound above is flatted with the spades— silence, 
A minute, no one moves or speaks—it is done,He is 
decently put away—is there anything more?14 He was a good 
fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered, not bad-looking, able to take his own 
part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life or 
death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, 
drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, 
grew low-spirited toward the last, sickened, was helped by a 
contribution, died, aged forty- one years—and that was his funeral.
