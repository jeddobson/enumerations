done for you.5 There shall from me be a new 
friendship—It shall be called after my name, It shall circulate 
through The States, indifferent of place, It shall twist and 
intertwist them through and around each other—Compact shall they be, 
showing new signs, Affection shall solve every one of the 
problems of freedom, Those who love each other shall be 
invincible,They shall finally make America completely victo- rious, in my 
name. 6 One from Massachusetts shall be comrade to a 
Mis- sourian, One from Maine or Vermont, and a Carolinian 
and an Oregonese, shall be friends triune, more pre- cious 
to each other than all the riches of the earth. 
7 To Michigan shall be wafted perfume from Florida,To the 
Mannahatta from Cuba or Mexico,Not the perfume of flowers, but 
sweeter, and wafted beyond death. 8 No danger shall balk 
Columbia's lovers,If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate them- 
selves for one, The Kanuck shall be willing to lay 
down his life for the Kansian, and the Kansian for 
the Kanuck, on due need. 9 It shall be customary 
in all directions, in the houses and streets, to see 
manly affection, The departing brother or friend shall salute the 
re- maining brother or friend with a kiss. 10 There 
shall be innovations,There shall be countless linked hands—namely, the Northeasterner's, 
and the Northwesterner's, and the Southwesterner's, and those of the 
interior, and all their brood, These shall be masters of 
the world under a new power, They shall laugh to 
scorn the attacks of all the re- mainder of the 
world. 11 The most dauntless and rude shall touch face 
to face lightly, The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,The 
continuance of Equality shall be comrades.12 These shall tie and 
band stronger than hoops of iron,I, extatic, O partners! O
