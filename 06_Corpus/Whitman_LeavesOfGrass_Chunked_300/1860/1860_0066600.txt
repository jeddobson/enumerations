floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, I saw how 
the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and 
left the rest in strong shadow, I saw the slow-wheeling 
circles, and the gradual edging toward the south. 8 I 
too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the 
water, Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of 
beams, Looked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round

in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and 
glistening, The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray 
walls of the granite store-houses by the docks, On the 
river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flanked on 
each side by the bargesâ€”the hay-boat, the belated lighter, On 
the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning 
high and glaringly into the night, Casting, their flicker of 
black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light, over the 
tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.
