of us with his or her right upon the earth, 
Each of us allowed the eternal purport of the earth,Each 
of us here as divinely as any is here.32 You 
Hottentot with clicking palate!You woolly-haired hordes! you white or black 
owners of slaves! You owned persons, dropping sweat-drops or blood- 
drops! You human forms with the fathomless ever-impressive countenances of

I have run through what any river or strait of 
the globe has run through, I have taken my stand 
on the bases of peninsulas, and on the highest embedded 
rocks, to cry thence. 36 Salut au Monde! What cities
