that neighbors them, Cutters down of wood, and haulers of 
it to the Pe- nobscot, or Kennebec, Dwellers in cabins 
among the Californian mountains, or by the little lakes, or 
on the Columbia, Dwellers south on the banks of the 
Gila or Rio Grande—friendly gatherings, the characters and fun, Dwellers 
up north in Minnesota and by the Yellow- stone river—dwellers 
on coasts and off coasts, Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking 
passages through the ice. 26 The shapes arise!Shapes of factories, 
arsenals, foundries, markets,Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads,Shapes of 
the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches, Shapes of 
the fleets of barges, tows, lake craft, river craft. 27 
The shapes arise!Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Eastern and Western

kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatack-roots for knees,

the workmen busy outside and inside, The tools lying around, 
the great auger and little auger, the adze, bolt, line, 
square, gouge, and bead-plane. 28 The shapes arise!The shape measured, 
sawed, jacked, joined, stained,The coffin-shape for the dead to lie 
within in his shroud; The shape got out in posts, 
in the bedstead posts, in the posts of the bride's

the rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's cradle, The 
shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for dancers' feet, The 
shape of the planks of the family home, the home 
of the friendly parents and children, The shape of the 
roof of the home of the happy young man and 
woman, the roof over the well- married young man and 
woman, The roof over the supper joyously cooked by the 
chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the chaste husband, content
