middle; Coming home with the silent and dark-cheeked bush-boy—riding behind 
him at the drape of the day, Far from the 
settlements, studying the print of ani- mals' feet, or the 
moccason print, By the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade 
to a feverish patient, By the coffined corpse when all 
is still, examining with a candle, Voyaging to every port, 
to dicker and adventure,Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager 
and fickle as any, Hot toward one I hate, ready

with a pike-pointed staff—Clinging to topples of brittle and blue. 
207 I ascend to the foretruck,I take my place late 
at night in the crow's-nest,We sail the arctic sea—it is 
plenty light enough,Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on
