the thongs and knife of the gelder. 2 Sauntering the 
pavement, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, here then are faces, 
I see them and complain not, and am content with 
all. 3 Do you suppose I could be content with 
all; if I thought them their own finale? 4 This 
now is too lamentable a face for a man,Some abject 
louse, asking leave to be—cringing for it,Some milk-nosed maggot, blessing

and mean dis- guises. 14 Splay and twist as you 
like—poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats, You'll 
be unmuzzled, you certainly will.15 I saw the face of
