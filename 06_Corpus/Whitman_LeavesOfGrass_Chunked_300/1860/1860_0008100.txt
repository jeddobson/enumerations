and look at them sometimes an hour at a stretch. 
193 They do not sweat and whine about their condition,They 
do not lie awake in the dark and weep for 
their sins, They do not make me sick discussing their 
duty to God, No one is dissatisfied—not one is demented

Soul! now I know it is true, what I guessed 
at, What I guessed when I loafed on the grass,What 
I guessed while I lay alone in my bed,And again
