death, I should die now, Do you think I could 
walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation? 36 Pleasantly and well-suited 
I walk,Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know 
it is good,The whole universe indicates that it is good,The 
past and the present indicate that it is good.37 How 
beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my 
Soul! How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon 
it! What is called good is perfect, and what is 
called bad is just as perfect, The vegetables and minerals 
are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids are perfect; Slowly 
and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly 
and surely they yet pass on. 38 My Soul! if 
I realize you, I have satisfaction,Animals and vegetables! if I 
realize you, I have sat- isfaction, Laws of the earth 
and air! if I realize you, I have satisfaction. 39 
I cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so,I cannot 
define my life, yet it is so.40 O it comes 
to me now!I swear I think now that everything without 
excep- tion has an eternal Soul! The trees have, rooted 
in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the 
animals! 41 I swear I think there is nothing but 
immortality!That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous 
float is for it, and the cohering is for it! 
And all preparation is for it! and identity is for 
it! and life and death are altogether for it! 449 
TO MY SOUL.1 AS nearing departure,As the time draws nigh, 
glooming from you,A cloud—a dread beyond, of I know not 
what, dark- ens me. 2 I shall go forth,I shall 
traverse The States—but I cannot tell whither or how long; 
Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing,
