confronting the waves,I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of 
here and here- after, Taking all hints to use them—but 
swiftly leaping beyond them, A reminiscence sing.REMINISCENCE.1 ONCE, Paumanok,When the 
snows had melted, and the Fifth Month grass was growing, 
Up this sea-shore, in some briers,Two guests from Alabama—two together,And
