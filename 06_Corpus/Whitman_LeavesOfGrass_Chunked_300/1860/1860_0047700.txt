heart pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting, The 
aria's meaning, the ears, the Soul, swiftly depos- iting, The 
strange tears down the cheeks coursing,The colloquy there—the trio—each uttering,The 
undertone—the savage old mother, incessantly crying, To the boy's Soul's 
questions sullenly timing—some drowned secret hissing, To the outsetting bard

look, a word! O well-beloved!O you dear women's and men's 
phantoms!32 A word then, (for I will conquer it,)The word
