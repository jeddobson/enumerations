States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants, The Union, always 
swarming with blatherers, and always calm and impregnable, The unsurveyed 
interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, trappers; Surrounding the multiform 
agriculture, mines, tem- perature, the gestation of new States, Congress 
convening every Twelfth Month, the mem- bers duly coming up 
from the uttermost parts; Surrounding the noble character of mechanics 
and farmers, especially the young men, Responding their manners, speech, 
dress, friendships —the gait they have of persons who never 
knew how it felt to stand in the presence of 
superiors, The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness 
and decision of their phrenology, The picturesque looseness of their 
carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom, their fierceness when wronged, 
The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their 
curiosity, good temper, and open-handed- ness—the whole composite make, The 
prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large am- ativeness, The perfect 
equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement 
of the population, The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, 
gold-digging, Wharf-hemmed cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all points, 
Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east, north-west, south-west, Manhattan 
firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plan- tation life, Slavery, the 
tremulous spreading of hands to shelter it—the stern opposition to 
it, which ceases only when it ceases. 18 For these 
and the like, their own voices! For these, space ahead! 
Others take finish, but the Republic is ever con- structive, 
and ever keeps vista; Others adorn the past—but you, O, 
days of the present, I adorn you! O days of 
the future, I believe in you!O America, because you build 
for mankind, I build for you! O well-beloved stone-cutters! I 
lead them who plan with decision and science, I lead 
the present with friendly hand toward the future. 19 Bravas
