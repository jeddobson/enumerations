and the wild-cat, and the whirr of the rattlesnake; The 
mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon—singing through the 
moon-lit night, The humming-bird, the wild-turkey, the raccoon, the opossum; 
A Tennessee corn-field—the tall, graceful, long-leaved corn—slender, flapping, bright green,
