part obe- diently from the path of one man or 
woman! The centuries, and all authority, to be trod under 
the foot-soles of one man or woman! 15 —A sterile 
landscape covers the ore—there is as good as the best, 
for all the forbidding appear- ance, There is the mine,

laid in the hollow of the great stone, Served the 
artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow-covered hills of

the granite walls rough sketches of the sun, moon, stars, 
ships, ocean-waves, Served the paths of the irruptions of the 
Goths— served the pastoral tribes and nomads, Served the incalculably 
distant Kelt—served the hardy pirates of the Baltic, Served before 
any of those, the venerable and harm- less men of 
Ethiopia, Served the making of helms for the galleys of 
pleasure, and the making of those for war, Served all 
great works on land, and all great works on the 
sea, For the medival ages, and before the mediæval ages, 
Served not the living only, then as now, but served 
the dead. 17 I see the European headsman,He stands masked, 
clothed in red, with huge legs, and strong naked arms,
