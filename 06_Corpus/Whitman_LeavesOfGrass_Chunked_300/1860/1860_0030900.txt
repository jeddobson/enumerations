nor afraid; Chanter of Personality, outlining a history yet to 
be,I project the ideal man, the American of the future. 
11.THE thought of fruitage,Of Death, (the life greater)—of seeds dropping 
into the ground—of birth, Of the steady concentration of America, 
inland, upward, to impregnable and swarming places, Of what Indiana,

the new and good names—of the strong develop- ments—of the

eyes, and perfect physique there, Of immense spiritual results, future 
years, inland, spread there each side of the Anahuacs, Of

the native scorn of grossness and gain there,(O it lurks 
in me night and day—What is gain, after all, to 
savageness and freedom?) 12.1 To oratists—to male or female,Vocalism, breath,
