without emergencies here, but life is per- petual emergencies here, 
Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall 
be superb; Friendship, self-esteem, justice, health, clear the way with 
irresistible power; How dare you place anything before a man?33 
Fall behind me, States!A man, before all—myself, typical, before all.34 
Give me the pay I have served for!Give me to 
speak beautiful words! take all the rest; I have loved 
the earth, sun, animals—I have despised riches, I have given 
alms to every one that asked, stood up for the 
stupid and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others, 
I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience 
and indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to 
nothing known or unknown, I have gone freely with powerful 
uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the mothers 
of families, I have read these leaves to myself in 
the open air— I have tried them by trees, stars, 
rivers, I have dismissed whatever insulted my own Soul or 
defiled my body, I have claimed nothing to myself which 
I have not carefully claimed for others on the same 
terms. I have studied my land, its idioms and men,I 
am willing to wait to be understood by the growth 
of the taste of myself, I reject none, I permit 
all,Whom I have staid with once I have found longing 
for me ever afterward. 34 I swear I begin to 
see the meaning of these things!It is not the earth, 
it is not America, who is so great,It is I 
who am great, or to be great—it is you, or 
any one, It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, govern- 
ments, theories, nature, poems, shows, to indi- viduals. 35 Underneath 
all are individuals,I swear nothing is good to me now
