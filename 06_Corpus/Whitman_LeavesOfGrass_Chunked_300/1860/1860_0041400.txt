you,Upon you, Governor, Mayor, Congressman,And you, contemporary America. 21.1 NOW 
I make a leaf of Voices—for I have found noth- 
ing mightier than they are, And I have found that 
no word spoken, but is beau- tiful, in its place. 
2 O what is it in me that makes me 
tremble so at voices? 3 Surely, whoever speaks to me 
in the right voice, him or her I shall follow, 
as the waters follow the moon, silently, with fluid steps, 
any where around the globe. 4 Now I believe that 
all waits for the right voices;Where is the practised and 
perfect organ? Where is the developed Soul? For I see 
every word uttered thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds, impossible 
on less terms. 5 I see brains and lips closed—I 
see tympans and tem- ples unstruck, Until that comes which 
has the quality to strike and to unclose, Until that 
comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies 
slumbering, forever ready, in all words. 22.1 WHAT am I, 
after all, but a child, pleased with the sound of 
my own name? repeating it over and over, I cannot 
tell why it affects me so much, when I hear 
it from women's voices, and from men's voices, or from 
my own voice, I stand apart to hear—it never tires 
me.2 To you, your name also,Did you think there was 
nothing but two or three pronunciations in the sound of 
your name? 23.LOCATIONS and times—what is it in me that 
meets them all, whenever and wherever, and makes me at 
home? Forms, colors, densities, odors—what is it in me that 
corresponds with them? What is the relation between me and 
them? 24.LIFT me close to your face till I whisper,What 
you are holding is in reality no book, nor part
