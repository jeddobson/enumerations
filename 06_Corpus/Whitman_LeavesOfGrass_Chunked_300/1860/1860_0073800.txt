440 BURIAL.1 TO think of it!To think of time—of all 
that retrospection!To think of to-day, and the ages continued hence- 
forward! 2 Have you guessed you yourself would not continue?Have 
you dreaded those earth-beetles?Have you feared the future would be 
nothing to you?3 Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past

press lightly on the forehead of the dying, The breath 
ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,The corpse stretches 
on the bed, and the living look upon it, It

upon the corpse with their eye-sight,But without eye-sight lingers a 
different living, and looks curiously on the corpse. 8 To 
think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, 
and fruits ripen, and act upon others as upon us 
now—yet not act upon us! To think of all these
