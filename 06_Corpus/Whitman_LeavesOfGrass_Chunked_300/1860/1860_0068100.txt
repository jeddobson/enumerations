HOME.O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, perfumed South! My South! O quick 
mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good and evil! O

his concealed hut;) O the strange fascination of these half-known, 
half- impassable swamps, infested by reptiles, resound- ing with the 
bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl
