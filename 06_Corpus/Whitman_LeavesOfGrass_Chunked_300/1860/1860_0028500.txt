bodies be freely handled and examined by whoever chooses! Let 
nothing but copies, pictures, statues, reminis- cences, elegant works, be 
permitted to exist upon the earth! Let the earth desert 
God, nor let there ever hence- forth be mentioned the 
name of God! Let there be no God!Let there be 
money, business, imports, exports, cus- tom, authority, precedents, pallor, dyspepsia, 
smut, ignorance, unbelief! Let judges and criminals be transposed! Let 
the prison-keepers be put in prison! Let those that were 
prisoners take the keys! (Say! why might they not just 
as well be transposed?) Let the slaves be masters! Let 
the masters become slaves! Let the reformers descend from the 
stands where they are forever bawling! Let an idiot or 
insane person appear on each of the stands! Let the 
Asiatic, the African, the European, the American and the Australian, 
go armed against the murderous stealthiness of each other! Let 
them sleep armed! Let none believe in good-will! Let there 
be no unfashionable wisdom! Let such be scorned and derided 
off from the earth! Let a floating cloud in the 
sky—Let a wave of the sea—Let one glimpse of your 
eye-sight upon the landscape or grass—Let growing mint, spinach, onions, 
tomatoes—Let these be exhibited as shows at a great price 
for admission! Let all the men of These States stand 
aside for a few smouchers! Let the few seize on 
what they choose! Let the rest gawk, giggle, starve, obey! 
Let shadows be furnished with genitals! Let sub- stances be 
deprived of their genitals! Let there be wealthy and immense 
cities—but through any of them, not a single poet, saviour, 
knower, lover! Let the infidels of These States laugh all 
faith away! If one man be found who has faith, 
let the rest set upon him! Let them affright faith!
