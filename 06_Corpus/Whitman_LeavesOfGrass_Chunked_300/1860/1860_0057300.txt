and women, among their families, at the table, in the 
bed-room, every- where, Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death 
under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, Under the broadcloth 
and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, Keeping fair 
with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, Speaking 
of anything else, but never of itself.52 Allons! Through struggles 
and wars!The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.53 Have 
the past struggles succeeded?What has succeeded? Yourself? Your nation? Nature?

armed,He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, 
angry enemies, desertions. 55 Allons! The road is before us!It 
is safe—I have tried it—my own feet have tried it 
well. 56 Allons! Be not detained!Let the paper remain on 
the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopened! 
Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money 
remain unearned! Let the school stand! mind not the cry 
of the teacher!Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let 
the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound 
the law. 57 Mon enfant! I give you my hand!I 
give you my love, more precious than money,I give you 
myself, before preaching or law;Will you give me yourself? Will 
you come travel with me? Shall we stick by each 
other as long as we live? 329 TO THE SAYERS
