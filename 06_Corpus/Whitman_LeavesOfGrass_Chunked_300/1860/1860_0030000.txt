Earth and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.2 
Open mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,Eyes of my Soul, 
seeing perfection,Natural life of me, faithfully praising things,Corroborating forever the 
triumph of things.3 Illustrious every one!Illustrious what we name space—sphere 
of unnum- bered spirits, Illustrious the mystery of motion, in

on! How the water sports and sings! (Surely it is

—with branches and leaves! (Surely there is something more in 
each of the trees— some living Soul.) 7 O amazement 
of things! even the least particle!O spirituality of things!O strain 
musical, flowing through ages and continents —now reaching me and 
America! I take your strong chords—I intersperse them, and cheerfully
