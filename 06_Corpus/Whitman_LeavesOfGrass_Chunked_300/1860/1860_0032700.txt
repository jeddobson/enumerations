neither accept nor reject,) It is no more in the 
legends than in all else,It is in the present—it is 
this earth to-day,It is in Democracy—in this America—the old world 
also, It is the life of one man or one 
woman to-day, the average man of to-day; It is languages, 
social customs, literatures, arts,It is the broad show of artificial 
things, ships, ma- chinery, politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the 
interchanges of nations, All for the average man of to-day. 
20.1 AMERICAN mouth-songs!Those of mechanics—each one singing, his, as it 
should be, blithe and strong, The carpenter singing his, as 
he measures his plank or beam, The mason singing his, 
as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work, 
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat 
—the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck, The shoemaker singing 
as he sits on his bench—the hatter singing as he 
stands, The wood-cutter's song—the ploughboy's, on his way in the 
morning, or at the noon intermission, or at sundown; The 
delicious singing of the mother—or of the young wife at 
work—or of the girl sewing or washing—Each singing what belongs 
to her, and to none else, The day what belongs 
to the day—At night, the party, of young fellows, robust, 
friendly, clean- blooded, singing with melodious voices, melo- dious thoughts. 
2 Come! some of you! still be flooding The States 
with hundreds and thousands of mouth-songs, fit for The States 
only. 21.1 As I walk, solitary, unattended,Around me I hear 
that eclat of the world—politics, produce, The announcements of recognized 
things—science,The approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions. 
2 I see the ships, (they will last a few 
years,)The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,And hear the 
indorsement of all, and do not object to it. 3
