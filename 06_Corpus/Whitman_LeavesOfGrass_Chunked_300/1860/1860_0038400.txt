the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure, 
The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture—the yearning 
and swelling heart, Affection that will not be gainsayed—the sense 
of what is real—the thought if, after all, it should 
prove unreal, The doubts of day-time and the doubts of 
night-time— the curious whether and how, Whether that which appears

The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of maroon-

of salt-marsh and shore-mud; These became part of that child 
who went forth every day, and who now goes, and

feel at home among common people, And to hold my 
own in terrible positions, on land and sea. 2 Not
