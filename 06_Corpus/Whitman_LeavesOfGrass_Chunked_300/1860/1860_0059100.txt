shall be glorified in them. 337 A BOSTON BALLAD, The 
78th Year of These States.1 CLEAR the way there, Jonathan!Way 
for the President's marshal! Way for the gov- ernment cannon! 
Way for the federal foot and dragoons—and the appa- ritions

10 Worse and worse! Can't you stand it! Are you 
retreating! Is this hour with the living too dead for
