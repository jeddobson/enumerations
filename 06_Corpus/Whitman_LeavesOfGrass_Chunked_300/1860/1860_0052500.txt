the breath, and breathing it in and out, The beauty 
of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence 
downward toward the knees, The thin red jellies within you, 
or within me—the bones, and the marrow in the bones, 
The exquisite realization of health,O I say now these are 
not the parts and poems of the body only, but 
of the Soul, O I say these are the Soul! 
4.1 A WOMAN waits for me—she contains all, nothing is 
lacking, Yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or 
if the moisture of the right man were lacking. 2 
Sex contains all,Bodies, Souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations, 
Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the semitic milk, 
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals,All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of 
the earth, All the governments, judges, gods, followed persons of 
the earth, These are contained in sex, as parts of 
itself, and jus- tifications of itself. 3 Without shame the 
man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his 
sex, Without shame the woman I like knows and avows 
hers. 4 O I will fetch bully breeds of children 
yet!I will dismiss myself from impassive women,I will go stay 
with her who waits for me, and with those women 
that are warm-blooded and suffi- cient for me; I see 
that they understand me, and do not deny me,I see 
that they are worthy of me—I will be the robust 
husband of those women. 5 They are not one jot 
less than I am,They are tanned in the face by 
shining suns and blow- ing winds, Their flesh has the 
old divine suppleness and strength,They know how to swim, row, 
ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend them- 
selves, They are ultimate in their own right—they are calm,
