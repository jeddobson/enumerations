from me? I follow you, whoever you are, from the 
present hour, My words itch at your ears till you 
understand them. 337 I do not say these things for 
a dollar, or to fill up the time while I 
wait for a boat, It is you talking just as 
much as myself—I act as the tongue of you, Tied 
in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosened.338 
I swear I will never again mention love or death 
inside a house, And I swear I will never translate 
myself at all, only to him or her who privately 
stays with me in the open air. 339 If you 
would understand me, go to the heights or water-shore, The 
nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion 
of waves a key, The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, 
second my words.340 No shuttered room or school can commune 
with me,But roughs and little children better than they.341 The 
young mechanic is closest to me—he knows me pretty well, 
The woodman, that takes his axe and jug with him, 
shall take me with him all day, The farm-boy, ploughing 
in the field, feels good at the sound of my 
voice, In vessels that sail, my words sail—I go with 
fisher- men and seamen, and love them. 342 My face 
rubs to the hunter's face, when he lies down alone 
in his blanket, The driver, thinking of me, does not 
mind the jolt of his wagon, The young mother and 
old mother comprehend me,The girl and the wife rest the 
needle a moment, and forget where they are, They and 
all would resume what I have told them.343 I have 
said that the Soul is not more than the body, 
And I have said that the body is not more
