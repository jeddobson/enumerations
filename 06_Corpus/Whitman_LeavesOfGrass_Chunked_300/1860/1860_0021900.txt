And leans on a ponderous axe.18 Whom have you slaughtered 
lately, European heads- man? Whose is that blood upon you, 
so wet and sticky?19 I see the clear sunsets of 
the martyrs,I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,Ghosts of 
dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected kings, Rivals, traitors, 
poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest. 20 I see those 
who in any land have died for the good cause, 
The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run 
out, (Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop 
shall never run out.) 21 I see the blood washed 
entirely away from the axe,Both blade and helve are clean,They 
spirt no more the blood of European nobles— they clasp 
no more the necks of queens. 22 I see the 
headsman withdraw and become useless,I see the scaffold untrodden and 
mouldy—I see no longer any axe upon it, I see 
the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my 
own race, the newest largest race. 23 America! I do 
not vaunt my love for you,I have what I have.24

States,Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans or for 
the poor or sick, Manhattan steamboats and clippers, taking the 
meas- ure of all seas. 25 The shapes arise!Shapes of 
the using of axes anyhow, and the users, and all
