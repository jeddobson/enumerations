note,For once, and more than once, dimly, down to the 
beach gliding, Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the 
shadows, Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds 
and sights after their sorts, The white arms out in 
the breakers tirelessly tossing,I, with bare feet, a child, the 
wind wafting my hair,Listened long and long.10 Listened, to keep, 
to sing—now translating the notes, Following you, my brother.11 Soothe! 
Soothe! Close on its wave soothes the wave behind, And 
again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close, But 
my love soothes not me .12 Low hangs the moon—it 
rose late, O it is lagging—O I think it is 
heavy with love .13 O madly the sea pushes upon 
the land, With love—with love .14 O night! O do 
I not see my love fluttering out there among the 
breakers? What is that little black thing I see there 
in the white? 15 Loud! Loud! Loud I call to 
you my love! High and clear I shoot my voice 
over the waves, Surely you must know who is here, 
You must know who I am, my love .16 Low-hanging 
moon! What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow? 
O it is the shape of my mate! O moon, 
do not keep her from me any longer .17 Land! 
O land! Whichever way I turn, O I think you 
could give me my mate back again, if you would, 
For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever 
way I look . 18 O rising stars! Perhaps the 
one I want so much will rise with some of 
you . 19 O throat! Sound clearer through the atmosphere! 
Pierce the woods, the earth, Somewhere listening to catch you 
must be the one I want . 20 Shake out,
