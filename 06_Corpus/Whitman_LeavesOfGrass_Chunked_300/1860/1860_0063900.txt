lovers, only repay me. 19.1 MIND you the timid models 
of the rest, the majority? Long I minded them, but 
hence I will not—for I have adopted models for myself, 
and now offer them to The Lands. 2 Behold this 
swarthy and unrefined face—these gray eyes, This beard—the white wool, 
unclipt upon my neck,My brown hands, and the silent manner 
of me, with- out charm; Yet comes one, a Manhattanese, 
and ever at parting, kisses me lightly on the lips 
with robust love, And I, in the public room, or 
on the crossing of the street, or on the ship's 
deck, kiss him in return; We observe that salute of 
American comrades, land and sea, We are those two natural 
and nonchalant persons. 20.I SAW in Louisiana a live-oak growing,All 
alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the 
branches, Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous leaves 
of dark green, And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made 
me think of myself, But I wondered how it could 
utter joyous leaves, standing alone there, without its friend, its 
lover near—for I knew I could not, And I broke 
off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon 
it, and twined around it a little moss, And brought 
it away—and I have placed it in sight in my 
room, It is not needed to remind me as of 
my own dear friends, (For I believe lately I think 
of little else than of them,) Yet it remains to 
me a curious token—it makes me think of manly love; 
For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in 
Louisiana, solitary, in a wide flat space, Uttering joyous leaves 
all its life, without a friend, a lover, near, I 
know very well I could not. 21.MUSIC always round me,
