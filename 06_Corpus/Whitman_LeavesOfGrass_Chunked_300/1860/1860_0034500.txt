great as the English? Great is the English brood—what brood 
has so vast a destiny as the English? It is 
the mother of the brood that must rule the earth 
with the new rule, The new rule shall rule as

could go front to front before God, Before the perfect 
judge all shall stand back—life and death shall stand back—heaven 
and hell shall stand back. 23 Great is Goodness!I do 
not know what it is, any more than I know 
what health is—but I know it is great. 24 Great

is great, and the eternal overthrow of things is great, 
And there is another paradox.26 Great is Life, real and 
mystical, wherever and whoever,Great is Death—sure as Life holds all
