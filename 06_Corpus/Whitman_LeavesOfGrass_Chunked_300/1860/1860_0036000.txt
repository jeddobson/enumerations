not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves 
in it, That all is clean, forever and forever,That the 
cool drink from the well tastes so good,That blackberries are

any part of the direct life-time, or the hour of 
death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward 
through the indirect life-time. 4 The indirect is more than 
the direct,The spirit receives from the body just as much
