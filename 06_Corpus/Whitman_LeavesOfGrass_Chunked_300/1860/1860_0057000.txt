The Soul travels,The body does not travel as much as 
the Soul,The body has just as great a work as 
the Soul, and parts away at last for the journeys 
of the Soul. 45 All parts away for the progress 
of Souls,All religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was 
or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls 
into niches and corners before the procession of Souls along 
the grand roads of the universe. 46 Of the progress 
of the Souls of men and women along the grand 
roads of the universe, all other prog- ress is the 
needed emblem and sustenance. 47 Forever alive, forever forward,Stately, solemn, 
sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbu- lent, feeble, dissatisfied, Desperate, proud, 
fond, sick, accepted by men, re- jected by men, They 
go! they go! I know that they go, but I 
know not where they go, But I know that they 
go toward the best—toward something great. 48 Allons! Whoever you 
are! come forth!You must not stay sleeping and dallying there 
in the house, though you built it, or though it 
has been built for you. 49 Allons! out of the 
dark confinement!It is useless to protest—I know all, and expose 
it.50 Behold, through you as bad as the rest,Through the 
laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, Inside of dresses and 
ornaments, inside of those washed and trimmed faces, Behold a 
secret silent loathing and despair.51 No husband, no wife, no 
friend, no lover, so trusted as to hear the confession, 
Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding 
it goes, open and above board it goes, Formless and 
wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland 
in the parlors, In the cars of rail-roads, in steam-boats, 
in the public assembly, Home to the houses of men
