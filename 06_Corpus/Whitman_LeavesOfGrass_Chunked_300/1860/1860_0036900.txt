assuredly following the direct, Who in his spirit in any 
emergency whatever neither hurries or avoids death. 6.1 PERFECT sanity 
shows the master among philosophs,Time, always without flaw, indicates itself 
in parts,What always indicates the poet, is the crowd of 
the pleasant company of singers, and their words, The words 
of the singers are the hours or minutes of the 
light or dark—but the words of the maker of poems 
are the general light and dark, The maker of poems 
settles justice, reality, immor- tality, His insight and power encircle 
things and the human race, He is the glory and 
extract, thus far, of things, and of the human race. 
2 The singers do not beget—only THE POET begets,The singers 
are welcomed, understood, appear often enough—but rare has the day 
been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker 
of poems, Not every century, or every five centuries, has 
con- tained such a day, for all its names. 3 
The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible 
names, but the name of each of them is one 
of the singers, The name of each is, a heart-singer, 
eye-singer, hymn- singer, law-singer, ear-singer, head-singer, sweet- singer, wise-singer, droll-singer, 
thrift-singer, sea- singer, wit-singer, echo-singer, parlor-singer, love- singer, passion-singer, mystic-singer, 
fable-singer, item-singer, weeping-singer, or something else. 4 All this time, 
and at all times, wait the words of poems; The 
greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of 
mothers and fathers, The words of poems are the tuft 
and final applause of science. 5 Divine instinct, breadth of 
vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of body, withdrawnness, 
gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness—such are some of the words of poems.

builder, geometer, mathematician, astronomer, melodist, chemist, anatomist, spiritualist, lan- guage-searcher,
