hears me, let him or her set out in search 
of this day. 165 My final merit I refuse you—I 
refuse putting from me the best I am. 166 Encompass 
worlds, but never try to encompass me,I crowd your sleekest 
talk by simply looking toward you. 167 Writing and talk 
do not prove me,I carry the plenum of proof, and 
everything else, in my face, With the hush of my 
lips I confound the topmost skeptic. 168 I think I 
will do nothing for a long time but listen,To accrue 
what I hear into myself—to let sounds contribute toward me. 
169 I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, 
gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals. 170 
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the 
human voice, I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused 
or following, Sounds of the city and sounds out of 
the city— sounds of the day and night, Talkative young 
ones to those that like them—the recitative of fish-pedlers and 
fruit-pedlers—the loud laugh of work-people at their meals, The angry 
base of disjointed friendship—the faint tones of the sick, The 
judge with hands tight to the desk, his shaky lips 
pronouncing a death-sentence, The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by 
the wharves—the refrain of the anchor-lifters, The ring of alarm-bells—the 
cry of fire—the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts, with 
premonitory tinkles, and colored lights, The steam-whistle—the solid roll of 
the train of approaching cars, The slow-march played at night 
at the head of the association, marching two and two, 
(They go to guard some corpse—the flag-tops are draped with 
black muslin.) 171 I hear the violoncello, or man's heart's 
complaint;I hear the keyed cornet—it glides quickly in through my 
ears, It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.
