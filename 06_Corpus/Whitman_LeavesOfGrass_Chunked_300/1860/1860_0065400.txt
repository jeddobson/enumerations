air, I leave,For comrades and lovers. 34.I DREAMED in a 
dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of 
the whole of the rest of the earth, I dreamed 
that was the new City of Friends,Nothing was greater there 
than the quality of robust love—it led the rest, It 
was seen every hour in the actions of the men 
of that city, And in all their looks and words. 
35.TO you of New England,To the man of the Seaside 
State, and of Pennsylvania,To the Kanadian of the north—to the 
Southerner I love, These, with perfect trust, to depict you 
as myself— the germs are in all men; I believe 
the main purport of These States is to found a 
superb friendship, exalté, previously unknown, Because I perceive it waits, 
and has been always wait- ing, latent in all men. 
36.EARTH! my likeness!Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric 
there, I now suspect that is not all;I now suspect 
there is something fierce in you, eligible to burst forth; 
For an athlete is enamoured of me—and I of him,But 
toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, 
eligible to burst forth, I dare not tell it in 
words—not even in these songs. 37.A LEAF for hand in 
hand!You natural persons old and young! You on the Eastern 
Sea, and you on the Western! You on the Mississippi, 
and on all the branches and bayous of the Mississippi! 
You friendly boatmen and mechanics! You roughs!You twain! And all 
processions moving along the streets! I wish to infuse myself 
among you till I see it com- mon for you 
to walk hand in hand. 38.PRIMEVAL my love for the 
woman I love,O bride ! O wife ! more resistless, 
more enduring than I can tell, the thought of you
