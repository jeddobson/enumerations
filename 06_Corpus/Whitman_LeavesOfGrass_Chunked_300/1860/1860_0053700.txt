any other man! O savage and tender achings!(I bequeath them 
to you, my children,I tell them to you, for reasons, 
O bridegroom and bride.) 3 O to be yielded to 
you, whoever you are, and you to be yielded me, 
in defiance of the world! (Know, I am a man, 
attracting, at any time, her I but look upon, or 
touch with the tips of my fingers, Or that touches 
my face, or leans against me.)4 O to return to 
Paradise!O to draw you to me—to plant on you, for 
the first time, the lips of a determined man! O 
rich and feminine! O to show you to realize the 
blood of life for yourself, whoever you are—and no matter 
when and where you live. 5 O the puzzle—the thrice-tied 
knot—the deep and dark pool! O all untied and illumined! 
O to speed where there is space enough and air 
enough at last! O to be absolved from previous follies 
and degrada- tions—I from mine, and you from yours! O 
to find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of 
nature! O to have the gag removed from one's mouth!O 
to have the feeling, to-day or any day, I am 
suffi- cient as I am! 6 O something unproved! something 
in a trance!O madness amorous! O trembling!O to escape utterly 
from others' anchors and holds!To drive free! to love free! 
to dash reckless and dangerous! To court destruction with taunts—with 
invitations!To ascend—to leap to the heavens of the love indicated 
to me! To rise thither with my inebriate Soul!To be 
lost, if it must be so!To feed the remainder of 
life with one hour of ful- ness and freedom! With 
one brief hour of madness and joy. 7.YOU and I—what 
the earth is, we are,We two—how long we were fooled!Now
