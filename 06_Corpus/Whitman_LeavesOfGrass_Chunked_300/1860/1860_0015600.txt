filled them, emp- tied them, And proceed to fill my 
next fold of the future.361 Listener up there! Here you! 
What have you to confide to me? Look in my 
face, while I snuff the sidle of evening,Talk honestly—no one 
else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer. 
362 Do I contradict myself?Very well, then, I contradict myself,I 
am large—I contain multitudes.363 I concentrate toward them that are 
nigh—I wait on the door-slab. 364 Who has done his 
day's work? Who will soonest be through with his supper? 
Who wishes to walk with me?365 Will you speak before 
I am gone? Will you prove already too late? 366 
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me—he complains of 
my gab and my loitering. 367 I too am not 
a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable,I sound my barbaric yawp 
over the roofs of the world.368 The last scud of 
day holds back for me,It flings my likeness, after the 
rest, and true as any, on the shadowed wilds, It 
coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.369 I depart 
as air—I shake my white locks at the run-away sun, 
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in 
lacy jags.370 I bequeathe myself to the dirt, to grow 
from the grass I love, If you want me again, 
look for me under your boot- soles. 371 You will 
hardly know who I am, or what I mean,But I 
shall be good health to you nevertheless,And filter and fibre 
your blood.372 Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged,Missing 
me one place, search another,I stop somewhere waiting for you.
