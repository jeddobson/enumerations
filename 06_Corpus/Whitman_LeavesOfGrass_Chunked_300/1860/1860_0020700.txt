rise and fall of the arms forcing the water, The 
slender, spasmic blue-white jets—the bringing to bear of the hooks 
and ladders, and their execution, The crash and cut away 
of connecting wood-work, or through floors, if the fire smoulders 
under them, The crowd with their lit faces, watching—the glare 
and dense shadows; The forger at his forge-furnace, and the 
user of iron after him, The maker of the axe 
large and small, and the welder and temperer, The chooser 
breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the 
edge with his thumb, The one who clean-shapes the handle 
and sets it firmly in the socket, The shadowy processions 
of the portraits of the past users also, The primal 
patient mechanics, the architects and engineers, The far-off Assyrian edifice 
and Mizra edifice,The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,The antique European 
warrior with his axe in combat, The uplifted arm, the 
clatter, of blows on the helmeted head, The death-howl, the 
limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe thither, 
The siege of revolted lieges determined for liberty,The summons to 
surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and parley, 
The sack of an old city in its time,The bursting 
in of mercenaries and bigots tumul- tuously and disorderly, Roar, 
flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, 
screams of women in the gripe of brigands, Craft and 
thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing, The hell 
of war, the cruelties of creeds,The list of all executive 
deeds and words, just or unjust, The power of personality, 
just or unjust.5 Muscle and pluck forever!What invigorates life, invigorates 
death,And the dead advance as much as the living advance,And 
the future is no more uncertain than the present,And the 
roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much
