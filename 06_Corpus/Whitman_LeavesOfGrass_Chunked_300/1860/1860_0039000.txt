I charge that there be no theory or school founded 
out of me, I charge you to leave all free, 
as I have left all free.11 After me, vista!O, I

planned and built one thing after another, as an architect 
plans and builds a house. 6 I do not think 
seventy years is the time of a man or woman, 
Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of
