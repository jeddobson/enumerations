you, All sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are 
tallied in you, The gist of histories and statistics as 
far back as the records reach, is in you this 
hour, and myths and tales the same, If you were 
not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?

your anger or wonder, The ankle-chain of the slave, the 
bed of the bed- house, the cards of the gambler, 
the plates of the forger, What is seen or learnt 
in the street, or intuitively learnt, What is learnt in
