take what is underfoot;What is yours is mine, my father.10 
I too Paumanok,I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless 
float, and been washed on your shores; I too am 
but a trail of drift and debris,I too leave little 
wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island. 11 I throw myself 
upon your breast, my father,I cling to you so that 
you cannot unloose me,I hold you so firm, till you 
answer me something.12 Kiss me, my father,Touch me with your 
lips, as I touch those I love,Breathe to me, while 
I hold you close, the secret of the wondrous murmuring 
I envy, For I fear I shall become crazed, if 
I cannot emulate it, and utter myself as well as 
it. 13 Sea-raff! Crook-tongued waves!O, I will yet sing, some 
day, what you have said to me. 14 Ebb, ocean 
of life, (the flow will return,)Cease not your moaning, you 
fierce old mother,Endlessly cry for your castaways—but fear not, deny 
not me, Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against 
my feet, as I touch you, or gather from you. 
15 I mean tenderly by you,I gather for myself, and 
for this phantom, looking down where we lead, and following 
me and mine. 16 Me and mine!We, loose winrows, little 
corpses,Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,(See! from my dead lips the 
ooze exuding at last!See—the prismatic colors, glistening and rolling!)Tufts of 
straw, sands, fragments,Buoyed hither from many moods, one contradicting another, 
From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell, 
Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of 
liquid or soil, Up just as much out of fathomless 
workings fer- mented and thrown, A limp blossom or two, 
torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, 
Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,Just
