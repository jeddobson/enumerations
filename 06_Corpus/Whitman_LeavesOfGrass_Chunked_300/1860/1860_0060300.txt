may be you are what it is all for—but it 
does not last so very long, But you will last 
very long. 3.1 WHOEVER you are holding me now in 
hand,Without one thing all will be useless,I give you fair 
warning, before you attempt me further, I am not what 
you supposed, but far different.2 Who is he that would 
become my follower?Who would sign himself a candidate for my 
affec- tions? Are you he? 3 The way is suspicious—the 
result slow, uncertain, may-be destructive; You would have to give 
up all else—I alone would expect to be your God, 
sole and exclusive, Your novitiate would even then be long 
and ex- hausting, The whole past theory of your life, 
and all conformity to the lives around you, would have 
to be aban- doned; Therefore release me now, before troubling 
yourself any further—Let go your hand from my shoulders, Put 
me down, and depart on your way.4 Or else, only 
by stealth, in some wood, for trial,Or back of a 
rock, in the open air,(For in any roofed room of 
a house I emerge not— nor in company, And in 
libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, 
or dead,) But just possibly with you on a high 
hill—first watching lest any person, for miles around, approach unawares, 
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the 
beach of the sea, or some quiet island, Here to 
put your lips upon mine I permit you,With the comrade's 
long-dwelling kiss, or the new husband's kiss, For I am 
the new husband, and I am the comrade.5 Or, if 
you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,Where I may feel 
the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip, 
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;For
