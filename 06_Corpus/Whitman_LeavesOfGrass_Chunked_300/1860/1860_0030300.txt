pass them forward. 8 I too carol the sun, ushered, 
or at noon, or setting,I too throb to the brain 
and beauty of the earth, and of all the growths 
of the earth, I too have felt the resistless call 
of myself.9 As I sailed down the Mississippi,As I wandered 
over the prairies,As I have lived—As I have looked through 
my windows, my eyes, As I went forth in the

evil as well as good; Of how many hold despairingly 
yet to the models departed, caste, myths, obedience, compulsion, and

The States—or see freedom or spirituality—or hold any faith in 
results, (But I see the Athletes—and I see the results 
glorious and inevitable—and they again leading to other results;) How 
the great cities appear—How the Democratic masses, turbulent, wilful, as 
I love them, How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle
