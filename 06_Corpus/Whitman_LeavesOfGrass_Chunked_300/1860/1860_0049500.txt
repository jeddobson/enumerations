What will the people say at last? Of the frivolous 
Judge—Of the corrupt Congressman, Governor, Mayor—Of such as these, standing 
helpless and exposed; Of the mumbling and screaming priest—(soon, soon

greater than the rest, Of the envelopment of all by 
them, and of the effusion of all from them. 287

procreation,Singing the need of superb children, and therein superb grown 
people, Singing the muscular urge and the blending,Singing the bedfellow's 
song, (O resistless yearning!O for any and each, the body 
correlative attracting!O for you, whoever you are, your correlative body! 
O it, more than all else, you delighting!) From the 
pent up rivers of myself,From the hungry gnaw that eats
