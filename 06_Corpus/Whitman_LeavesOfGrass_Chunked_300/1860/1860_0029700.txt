monk, and the knight—we easily include them, and more, We 
stand amid time, beginningless and endless—we stand amid evil and 
good, All swings around us—there is as much darkness as 
light, The very sun swings itself and its system of

all that has ever come of races and days, or 
ever will come. 8.1 SPLENDOR of falling day, floating and
