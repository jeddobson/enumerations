unrealized baby-days,Journeyers gayly with their own youth—journeyers with their bearded 
and well-grained manhood, Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsur- passed, 
content, Journeyers with their sublime old age of manhood or 
womanhood, Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth 
of the universe, Old age, flowing free with the delicious 
near-by free- dom of death. 43 Allons! To that which 
is endless, as it was beginning- less,To undergo much, tramps 
of days, rests of nights,To merge all in the travel 
they tend to, and the days and nights they tend 
to, Again to merge them in the start of superior 
jour- neys; To see nothing anywhere but what you may 
reach it and pass it, To conceive no time, however 
distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, 
To look up or down no road but it stretches 
and waits for you—however long, but it stretches and waits 
for you; To see no being, not God's or any, 
but you also go thither, To see no possession but 
you may possess it—enjoy- ing all without labor or purchase—abstracting 
the feast, yet not abstracting one particle of it; To 
take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich 
man's elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married 
couple, and the fruits of or- chards and flowers of 
gardens, To take to your use out of the compact 
cities as you pass through, To carry buildings and streets 
with you afterward wherever you go, To gather the minds 
of men out of their brains as you encounter them—to 
gather the love out of their hearts, To take your 
own lovers on the road with you, for all that 
you leave them behind you, To know the universe itself 
as a road—as many roads—as roads for travelling Souls. 44
