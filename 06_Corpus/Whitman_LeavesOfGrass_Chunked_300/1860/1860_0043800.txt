fetish, and the obi. 28 I see African and Asiatic 
towns,I see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo, Monrovia, I see 
the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi, Calcutta, Yedo, I 
see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and 
Ashantee-man in their huts, I see the Turk smoking opium 
in Aleppo,I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of 
Khiva, and those of Herat, I see Teheran—I see Muscat 
and Medina, and the intervening sands—I see the caravans toiling 
onward; I see Egypt and the Egyptians—I see the pyramids 
and obelisks, I look on chiselled histories, songs, philosophies, cut 
in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite blocks, I see 
at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies, embalmed, swathed in linen cloth, 
lying there many centuries, I look on the fall'n Theban, 
the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping neck, the hands folded across 
the breast. 29 I see the menials of the earth, 
laboring,I see the prisoners in the prisons,I see the defective 
human bodies of the earth,I see the blind, the deaf 
and dumb, idiots, hunch- backs, lunatics, I see the pirates, 
thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave- makers of the earth, I see 
the helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women. 
30 I see male and female everywhere,I see the serene 
brotherhood of philosophs,I see the constructiveness of my race,I see 
the results of the perseverance and industry of my race, 
I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations—I go among them—I mix 
indiscriminately, And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.31 
You, where you are!You daughter or son of England!You of 
the mighty Slavic tribes and empires! you Russ in Russia! 
You dim-descended, black, divine-souled African, large, fine-headed, nobly-formed, superbly des- 
tined, on equal terms with me! You Norwegian! Swede! Dane! 
Icelander! you Prussian! You Spaniard of Spain! you Portuguese!You Frenchwoman
