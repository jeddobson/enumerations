that is done about a locomotive, The bear-hunt or coon-hunt—the 
bonfire of shavings in the open lot in the city, 
and the crowd of children watching, The blows of the 
fighting-man, the upper-cut, and one-two-three, Pyrotechny, letting off colored fire-works 
at night, fancy figures and jets, Shop-windows, coffins in the 
sexton's ware-room, fruit on the fruit-stand—beef in the butcher's stall, 
the slaughter-house of the butcher, the butcher in his killing-clothes, 
The area of pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the 
hog-hook, the scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's 
maul, and the plenteous winter-work of pork-packing, Flour-works, grinding of 
wheat, rye, maize, rice— the barrels and the half and 
quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the high piles on wharves 
and levees, Bread and cakes in the bakery, the milliner's 
rib- bons, the dress-maker's patterns, the tea-table, the home-made sweetmeats; 
Cheap literature, maps, charts, lithographs, daily and weekly newspapers, The 
column of wants in the one-cent paper, the news by 
telegraph, amusements, operas, shows, The business parts of a city, 
the trottoirs of a city when thousands of well-dressed people 
walk up and down, The cotton, woollen, linen you wear, 
the money you make and spend, Your room and bed-room, 
your piano-forte, the stove and cook-pans, The house you live 
in, the rent, the other tenants, the deposit in the 
savings-bank, the trade at the grocery, The pay on Seventh 
Day night, the going home, and the purchases; In them 
the heft of the heaviest—in them far more than you 
estimated, and far less also, In them realities for you 
and me—in them poems for you and me, In them, 
not yourself—you and your Soul enclose all things, regardless of 
estimation, In them themes, hints, provokers—if not, the whole earth 
has no themes, hints, provokers, and never had. 30 I
