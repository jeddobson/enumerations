any one I love, or if my own corpse, be 
duly rendered to powder, and poured in the sea, I 
shall be satisfied, Or if it be distributed to the 
winds, I shall be sat- isfied. 18.CITY of my walks

win- dows, with goods in them, Nor to converse with 
learned persons, or bear my share in the soiree or 
feast; Not those—but, as I pass, O Manhattan! your fre- 
quent and swift flash of eyes offering me love, Offering 
me the response of my own—these repay me, Lovers, continual
