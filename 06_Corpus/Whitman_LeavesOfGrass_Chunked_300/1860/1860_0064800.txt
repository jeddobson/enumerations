and fearless—eating, drinking, sleeping, lov- ing, No law less than 
ourselves owning—sailing, soldier- ing, thieving, threatening, Misers, menials, priests alarming—air 
breathing, water drinking, on the turf or the sea-beach dancing, 
With birds singing—With fishes swimming—With trees branching and leafing, Cities 
wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chasing, Fulfilling our foray. 
27.O LOVE!O dying—always dying!O the burials of me, past and 
present!O me, while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperi- ous 
as ever! O me, what I was for years, now 
dead, (I lament not —I am content;), O to disengage

odium, un- changing, long and long, Through youth, and through 
middle and old age, how unfaltering, how affectionate and faithful 
they were, Then I am pensive—I hastily put down the 
book, and walk away, filled with the bitterest envy. 29.ONE 
flitting glimpse, caught through an interstice,Of a crowd of workmen 
and drivers in a bar-room, around the stove, late of

a youth who loves me, and whom I love, silently 
approaching, and seating himself near, that he may hold me 
by the hand; A long while, amid the noises of 
coming and going —of drinking and oath and smutty jest, 
There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, 
perhaps not a word. 30.A PROMISE and gift to California,Also
