in the chest- nut shade, to the rebeck and guitar, 
I hear continual echoes from the Thames,I hear fierce French 
liberty songs,I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative 
of old poems, I hear the Virginia plantation chorus of 
negroes, of a harvest night, in the glare of pine 
knots, I hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men of 
Manhatta, I hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, and singing, 
I hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary north- 
west lakes, I hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as 
they strike the grain and grass with the showers of 
their terrible clouds, I hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, 
pensively falling on the breast of the black venerable vast 
mother, the Nile, I hear the bugles of raft-tenders on 
the streams of Kanada, I hear the chirp of the 
Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule, I hear 
the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque, 
I hear Christian priests at the altars of their churches 
—I hear the responsive base and soprano, I hear the 
wail of utter despair of the white-haired Irish grand-parents, when 
they learn the death of their grand-son, I hear the 
cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to 
sea at Okotsk, I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, 
as the slaves march on—as the husky gangs pass on 
by twos and threes, fastened together with wrist-chains and ankle-chains, 
I hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment 
—I hear the sibilant whisk of thongs through the air; 
I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,I hear 
the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends 
of the Romans, I hear the tale of the divine 
life and bloody death of the beautiful God, the Christ,
