sun-light and pasture-fields, Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to 
swap off with touch, and go and graze at the 
edges of me, No consideration, no regard for my draining 
strength or my anger, Fetching the rest of the herd 
around to enjoy them a while, Then all uniting to 
stand on a headland and worry me. 179 The sentries 
desert every other part of me,They have left me helpless 
to a red marauder,They all come to the headland, to

own delivery, nor resist it,They do not need the obstetric 
forceps of the surgeon, The insignificant is as big to 
me as any,What is less or more than a touch?186 
Logic and sermons never convince,The damp of the night drives 
deeper into my Soul.187 Only what proves itself to every 
man and woman is so, Only what nobody denies is 
so.188 A minute and a drop of me settle my 
brain,I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps, 
And a compend of compends is the meat of a 
man or woman, And a summit and flower there is
