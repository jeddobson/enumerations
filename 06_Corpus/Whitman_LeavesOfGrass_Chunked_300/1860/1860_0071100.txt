wish humanity different?Could I wish the people made of wood 
and stone?Or that there be no justice in destiny or 
time?4 O Liberty! O mate for me!Here too keeps the

And I send these words to Paris, with my love,And 
I guess some chansonniers there will understand them, For I 
guess there is latent music yet in France— floods of 
it, O I hear already the bustle of instruments—they will 
soon be drowning all that would interrupt them, O I 
think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march, 
It reaches hither—it swells me to joyful madness,I will run 
transpose it in words, to justify it,I will yet sing 
a song for you, ma femme. 408 THOUGHTS. 1.OF the

beneath; Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in 
it as there is in beauty—And now the ugliness of

detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than undetected 
per- sons—and are not in any respect worse than I 
am myself; Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, 
is equally criminal—and any reputable person is also—and the President 
is also. 2.OF waters, forests, hills,Of the earth at large,
