and thoughtful; It seems to me I can look over 
and behold them, in Germany, Italy, France, Spain—Or far, far 
away, in China, or in Russia or India—talking other dialects; 
And it seems to me if I could know those 
men better, I should become attached to them, as I

never obedient, Those of inland America. 26.WE two boys together 
clinging,One the other never leaving,Up and down the roads going—North 
and South excursions making, Power enjoying—elbows stretching—fingers clutch- ing, Armed
