to wet the soil of graves? I WILL take an 
egg out of the robin's nest in the orchard, I 
will take a branch of gooseberries from the old bush 
in the garden, and go and preach to the world; 
You shall see I will not meet a single heretic 
or scorner, You shall see how I stump clergymen, and 
confound them, You shall see me showing a scarlet tomato, 
and a white pebble from the beach. BEHAVIOR—fresh, native, copious, 
each one for him- self or herself, Nature and the 
Soul expressed—America and free- dom expressed—In it the finest art, 
In it pride, cleanliness, sympathy, to have their chance, In 
it physique, intellect, faith—in it just as much as to 
manage an army or a city, or to write a 
book —perhaps more, The youth, the laboring person, the poor 
person, rivalling all the rest—perhaps outdoing the rest, The effects 
of the universe no greater than its;For there is nothing 
in the whole universe that can be more effective than 
a man's or woman's daily behavior can be, In any 
position, in any one of These States. NOT the pilot 
has charged himself to bring his ship into port, though 
beaten back, and many times baffled, Not the path-finder, penetrating 
inland, weary and long, By deserts parched, snows chilled, rivers 
wet, per- severes till he reaches his destination, More than 
I have charged myself, heeded or un- heeded, to compose 
a free march for These States, To be exhilarating music 
to them, years, centuries hence. I THOUGHT I was not 
alone, walking here by the shore,But the one I thought 
was with me, as now I walk by the shore, 
As I lean and look through the glimmering light— that 
one has utterly disappeared, And those appear that perplex me.
