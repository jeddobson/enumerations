my neck,Music rolls, but not from the organ,Folks are around 
me, but they are no household of mine. 281 Ever 
the hard unsunk ground,Ever the eaters and drinkers—Ever the upward

Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real, Ever the

know perfectly well my own egotism,I know my omnivorous words, 
and cannot say any less, And would fetch you, whoever 
you are, flush with myself. 287 My words are words 
of a questioning, and to indicate reality and motive power:
