nobles fall; The People scorned the ferocity of kings.4 But 
the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened 
rulers come back, Each comes in state with his train—hangman, 
priest, tax-gatherer, Soldier, lawyer, lords, jailers, and sycophants.5 Yet behind 
all, hovering, stealing—lo, a Shape,Vague as the night, draped interminably, 
head front and form, in scarlet folds, Whose face and 
eyes none may see,Out of its robes only this—the red

men; The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets 
of princes are flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud, 
And all these things bear fruits—and they are good.7 Those 
corpses of young men,Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets—those 
hearts pierced by the gray lead, Cold and motionless as 
they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughter'd vitality. 8 They live

ready to defy you!They were purified by death—they were taught 
and exalted. 9 Not a grave of the murdered for 
freedom, but grows seed for freedom, in its turn to 
bear seed, Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and 
the rains and the snows nourish. 10 Not a disembodied 
spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose, But it 
stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counselling, cautioning. 11 Liberty! 
let others despair of you! I never despair of you. 
12 Is the house shut? Is the master away?Nevertheless be 
ready—be not weary of watching,He will soon return—his messengers come 
anon. 286 THOUGHT.OF Public Opinion,Of a calm and cool fiat,
