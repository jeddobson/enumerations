through the longest time? By God! I will outvie him! 
I will say such words, they shall stretch through longer 
time! And who has received the love of the most 
friends? For I know what it is to receive the 
passionate love of many friends; And to whom has been 
given the sweetest from women, and paid them in kind? 
For I will take the like sweets and pay them 
in kind; And who possesses a perfect and enamoured body? 
For I do not believe any one possesses a more 
perfect or enamoured body than mine; And who thinks the 
amplest thoughts? For I will surround those thoughts; And who 
has made hymns fit for the earth? For I am 
mad with devouring extacy to make joyous hymns for the 
whole earth! 16.THEY shall arise in the States—mediums shall,They shall 
report Nature, laws, physiology, and happiness, They shall illustrate Democracy 
and the kosmos,They shall be alimentive, amative, perceptive,They shall be 
complete women and men—their pose brawny and supple, their drink 
water, their blood clean and clear, They shall enjoy materialism 
and the sight of prod- ucts—they shall enjoy the sight 
of the beef, lumber, bread-stuffs, of Chicago, the great city, 
They shall train themselves to go in public to become 
oratists, (orators and oratresses,) Strong and sweet shall their tongues 
be—poems and materials of poems shall come from their lives— 
they shall be makers and finders, Of them, and of 
their works, shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey gospels, Characters, 
events, retrospections, shall be conveyed in gospels—Trees, animals, waters, shall 
be conveyed, Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all 
be conveyed. 17.1 Now we start hence, I with the 
rest, on our jour- neys through The States, We willing 
learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.
