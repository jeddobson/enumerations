of what avail am I to you? To bear—to better—lacking 
these, of what avail am I? 10 Accouche! Accouchez!Will you 
rot your own fruit in yourself there?Will you squat and 
stifle there?11 The earth does not argue,Is not pathetic, has 
no arrangements,Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,Makes no discriminations, 
has no conceivable fail- ures, Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts 
none out,Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts 
none out. 12 The earth does not exhibit itself, nor 
refuse to exhibit itself—possesses still underneath, Underneath the ostensible sounds, 
the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves, Persuasions 
of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young 
people, accents of bargainers, Underneath these, possessing the words that 
never fail. 13 To her children, the words of the 
eloquent dumb great mother never fail, The true words do 
not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does 
not fail, Also the day and night do not fail, 
and the voyage we pursue does not fail. 14 Of 
the interminable sisters,Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,Of the centripetal 
and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters, The beautiful 
sister we know dances on with the rest.15 With her 
ample back toward every beholder,With the fascinations of youth, and 
the equal fascina- tions of age, Sits she whom I 
too love like the rest—sits undis- turbed, Holding up in 
her hand what has the character of a mirror, while 
her eyes glance back from it, Glance as she sits, 
inviting none, denying none,Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly 
before her own face. 16 Seen at hand, or seen 
at a distance,Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,Duly 
approach and pass with their companions, or a companion, Looking 
from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances
