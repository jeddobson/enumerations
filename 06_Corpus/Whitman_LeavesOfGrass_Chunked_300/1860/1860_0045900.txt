in the bloody foam. 25 O the old manhood of 
me, my joy!My children and grand-children—my white hair and beard, 
My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of 
my life. 26 O the ripened joy of womanhood!O perfect 
happiness at last!I am more than eighty years of age—my

orchard—the forest—the oak, cedar, pine, pekan-tree, The honey-locust, black-walnut, cottonwood, 
and mag- nolia. 30 O Death!O the beautiful touch of 
Death, soothing and benumb- ing a few moments, for reasons; 
O that of myself, discharging my excrementitious body, to be
