VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, 
moons, planets, comets, asteroids, All the substances of the same, 
and all that is spiritual, upon the same, All distances

past, present, future,This vast similitude spans them, and always has 
spanned, and shall forever span them, and compactly hold them.

chained with iron, or my ankles with iron? 5 You 
prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs, or obscene in your rooms, 
Who am I, that I should call you more obscene 
than myself? 6 O culpable! O traitor!O I acknowledge—I exposé!(O 
admirers! praise not me! compliment not me! you make me 
wince, I see what you do not—I know what you
