conquered doors they crowd. I am possessed. 244 What the 
rebel said, gayly adjusting his throat to the rope-noose, What 
the savage at the stump, his eye-sockets empty, his mouth 
spirting whoops and defiance, What stills the traveller come to 
the vault at Mount Vernon, What sobers the Brooklyn boy 
as he looks down the shores of the Wallabout and 
remembers the Prison Ships, What burnt the gums of the 
red-coat at Saratoga when he surrendered his brigades, These become

The whirling and whirling elemental within me.252 Somehow I have 
been stunned. Stand back!Give me a little time beyond my 
cuffed head, slum- bers, dreams, gaping, I discover myself on 
the verge of a usual mistake.253 That I could forget
