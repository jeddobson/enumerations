How spiritual! How resumé!The same Old Man and Soul—the same

thinking the day most splendid, till I saw what the 
not-day exhibited, I was thinking this globe enough, till there

The change thence to the sight here, and to the 
subtle air breathed by beings like us, who walk this 
sphere; The change onward from ours to that of beings
