man and woman, The herbs of the morning sprout no 
fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of 
them- selves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet contin- ually 
out of itself. 29 Toward the fluid and attaching character 
exudes the sweat of the love of young and old, 
From it falls distilled the charm that mocks beauty and 
attainments, Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 
30 Allons! Whoever you are, come travel with me!Travelling with 
me, you find what never tires.31 The earth never tires,The 
earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first— Nature is rude 
and incomprehensible at first; Be not discouraged—keep on—there are divine 
things, well enveloped, I swear to you there are divine 
things more beautiful than words can tell. 32 Allons! We 
must not stop here!However sweet these laid-up stores—however con- venient 
this dwelling, we cannot remain here, However sheltered this port, 
and however calm these waters, we must not anchor here, 
However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we are permitted 
to receive it but a little while. 33 Allons! The 
inducements shall be great to you;We will sail pathless and 
wild seas;We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and 
the Yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. 34 Allons! 
With power, liberty, the earth, the elements!Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, 
curiosity;Allons! from all formules!From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic 
priests! 35 The stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial 
waits no longer. 36 Allons! Yet take warning!He travelling with 
me needs the best blood, thews, endurance, None may come 
to the trial, till he or she bring courage and 
health. 37 Come not here if you have already spent 
the best of yourself; Only those may come, who come 
in sweet and deter- mined bodies, No diseased person—no rum-drinker
