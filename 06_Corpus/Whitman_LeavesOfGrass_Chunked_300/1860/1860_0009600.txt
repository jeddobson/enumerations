the wonderful beauty, The enormous masses of ice pass me, 
and I pass them —the scenery is plain in all 
directions, The white-topped mountains show in the distance— I fling 
out my fancies toward them, We are approaching some great

I am the man—I suffered—I was there.212 The disdain and 
calmness of martyrs,The mother, condemned for a witch, burnt with
