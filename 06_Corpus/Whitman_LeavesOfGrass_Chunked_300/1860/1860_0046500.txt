the ribs and throat, To make the people rage, weep, 
hate, desire, with yourself, To lead America—to quell America with 
a great tongue. 40 O the joy of a manly 
self-hood!Personality—to be servile to none—to defer to none —not to 
any tyrant, known or unknown, To walk with erect carriage, 
a step springy and elastic, To look with calm gaze, 
or with a flashing eye,To speak with a full and 
sonorous voice, out of a broad chest, To confront with 
your personality all the other per- sonalities of the earth. 
41 O to have my life henceforth my poem of 
joys!To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, 
float on, An athlete—full of rich words—full of joys. 269 
A WORD OUT OF THE SEA.OUT of the rocked cradle,Out 
of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,Out of the boy's 
mother's womb, and from the nipples of her breasts, Out 
of the Ninth Month midnight,Over the sterile sands, and the 
fields beyond, where the child, leaving his bed, wandered alone, 
bare- headed, barefoot, Down from the showered halo,Up from the 
mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting as if they 
were alive, Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,From 
the memories of the bird that chanted to me,From your 
memories, sad brother—from the fitful risings and fallings I heard, 
From under that yellow half-moon, late-risen, and swollen as if 
with tears, From those beginning notes of sickness and love, 
there in the transparent mist, From the thousand responses of 
my heart, never to cease, From the myriad thence-aroused words,From 
the word stronger and more delicious than any,From such, as 
now they start, the scene revisiting,As a flock, twittering, rising, 
or overhead passing,Borne hither—ere all eludes me, hurriedly,A man—yet by 
these tears a little boy again,Throwing myself on the sand,
