wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may, Not these—O 
none of these, more than the flames of me, consuming, 
burning for his love whom I love! O none, more 
than I, hurrying in and out;Does the tide hurry, seeking 
something, and never give up? O I the same; O 
nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds, are 
borne through the open air, Any more than my Soul 
is borne through the open air, Wafted in all directions, 
O love, for friendship, for you. 15.O DROPS of me! 
trickle, slow drops,Candid, from me falling—drip, bleeding drops,From wounds made 
to free you whence you were prisoned, From my face—from 
my forehead and lips,From my breast—from within where I was 
con- cealed—Press forth, red drops—confession drops, Stain every page—stain every 
song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops, Let 
them know your scarlet heat—let them glisten,Saturate them with yourself, 
all ashamed and wet,Glow upon all I have written or 
shall write, bleed- ing drops, Let it all be seen 
in your light, blushing drops. 16.1 WHO is now reading 
this?2 May-be one is now reading this who knows some 
wrong-doing of my past life, Or may-be a stranger is 
reading this who has secretly loved me, Or may-be one 
who meets all my grand assumptions and egotisms with derision, 
Or may-be one who is puzzled at me.3 As if 
I were not puzzled at myself!Or as if I never 
deride myself! (O conscience-struck! O self-convicted!) Or as if I 
do not secretly love strangers! (O tenderly, a long time, 
and never avow it;) Or as if I did not 
see, perfectly well, interior in myself, the stuff of wrong-doing, 
Or as if it could cease transpiring from me until 
it must cease. 17.OF him I love day and night,
