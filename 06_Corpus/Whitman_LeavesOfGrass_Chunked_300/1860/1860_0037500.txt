I do not doubt there is far more in trivialities, 
insects, vulgar persons, slaves, dwarfs, weeds, rejected refuse, than I 
have supposed; I do not doubt there is more in 
myself than I have supposed—and more in all men and 
women— and more in my poems than I have supposed; 
I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and 
on, millions of years; I do not doubt interiors have 
their interiors, and exteriors have their exteriors—and that the eye-sight 
has another eye-sight, and the hearing another hearing, and the 
voice another voice; I do not doubt that the passionately-wept 
deaths of young men are provided for—and that the deaths 
of young women, and the deaths of little children, are 
provided for; I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, 
no matter what the horrors of them—no matter whose wife, 
child, husband, father, lover, has gone down—are pro- vided for, 
to the minutest point; I do not doubt that shallowness, 
meanness, malig- nance, are provided for; I do not doubt 
that cities, you, America, the re- mainder of the earth, 
politics, freedom, degra- dations, are carefully provided for; I do 
not doubt that whatever can possibly happen, any where, at 
any time, is provided for, in the inherences of things. 
8.1 WHAT shall I give? and which are my miracles?2 
Realism is mine—my miracles—Take freely,Take without end—I offer them to 
you wherever your feet can carry you, or your eyes 
reach. 3 Why! who makes much of a miracle?As to 
me, I know of nothing else but miracles,Whether I walk 
the streets of Manhattan,Or dart my sight over the roofs 
of houses toward the sky, Or wade with naked feet 
along the beach, just in the edge of the water, 
Or stand under trees in the woods,Or talk by day
