the trees —There is the turpentine distillery, There are the 
negroes at work, in good health—the ground in all directions 
is covered with pine straw; In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves 
busy in the coal- ings, at the forge, by the 
furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking; In Virginia, the planter's son

the aged mulatto nurse; On rivers, boatmen safely moored at 
night-fall, in their boats, under the shelter of high banks, 
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of

Dilation or Pride; In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, 
the aborigines—the calumet, the pipe of good-will arbitration, and indorsement, 
The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and 
then toward the earth, The drama of the scalp-dance enacted
