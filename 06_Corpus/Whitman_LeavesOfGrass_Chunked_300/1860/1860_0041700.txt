of a book, It is a man, flushed and full-blooded—it 
is I— So long! We must separate—Here! take from my 
lips this kiss, Whoever you are, I give it especially 
to you; So long —and I hope we shall meet 
again. 243 Salut au Monde!1 O TAKE my hand, Walt 
Whitman!Such gliding wonders! Such sights and sounds!Such joined unended links, 
each hooked to the next!Each answering all—each sharing the earth 
with all.2 What widens within you, Walt Whitman?What waves and 
soils exuding?What climes? What persons and lands are here?Who are 
the infants? Some playing, some slum- bering? Who are the 
girls? Who are the married women?Who are the three old 
men going slowly with their arms about each others' necks? 
What rivers are these? What forests and fruits are these? 
What are the mountains called that rise so high in 
the mists? What myriads of dwellings are they, filled with 
dwellers? 3 Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,Asia, Africa, Europe, 
are to the east—America is provided for in the west, 
Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,Curiously 
north and south turn the axis-ends;Within me is the longest 
day—the sun wheels in slanting rings—it does not set for 
months, Stretched in due time within me the midnight sun 
just rises above the horizon, and sinks again, Within me 
zones, seas, cataracts, plains, volcanoes, groups, Oceanica, Australasia, Polynesia, and 
the great West Indian islands. 4 What do you hear, 
Walt Whitman?5 I hear the workman singing, and the farmer's 
wife singing, I hear in the distance the sounds of 
children, and of animals early in the day, I hear 
quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and Kentucky, 
hunting on hills, I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing 
the wild horse, I hear the Spanish dance, with castanets,
