dimly, toiling under the sun, the dust-cover'd men,In columns rise 
and fall to the undulations of the ground,With artillery interspers'd—the 
wheels rumble, the horses sweat,As the army resistless advances.61 I 
will see if I have no meaning, while the houses 
and ships have meaning!I will see if the fishes and 
birds are to be enough for themselves, and I am

aloft—Still the Future of The States I harbinge, glad and 
sublime; And for the Past, I pronounce what the air 
holds of & 60 The red aborigines!Leaving natural breaths, sounds 
of rain and winds, calls as of birds and animals 
in the woods, syllabled to us for names; Okonee, Koosa,
