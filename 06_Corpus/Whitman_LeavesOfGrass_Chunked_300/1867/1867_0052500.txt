the swift current, I stood, yet was hurried; Just as 
you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the 
thick-stem'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.7 I too many and 
many a time cross'd the river, the sun half an 
hour high; I watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls—I saw them high 
in the air, floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,I 
saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their 
bodies, and left the rest in strong shadow,I saw the

the big steam-tug closely flank'd on each side by the 
barges—the hay-boat, the belated lighter,On the neighboring shore, the fires 
from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the
