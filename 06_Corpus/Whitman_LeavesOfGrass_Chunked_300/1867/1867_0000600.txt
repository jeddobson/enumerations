it was fittest for its days,That its life has descended 
to the stalwart and well- shaped heir who approaches,And that 
he shall be fittest for his days.21 Any period, one 
nation must lead,One land must be the promise and reliance 
of the future.22 These States are the amplest poem,Here is 
not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,Here 
the doings of men correspond with the broad- cast doings 
of the day and night,Here is what moves in magnificent 
masses, careless of particulars,Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combative-

Columbia, Niagara, Hudson, spending them- selves lovingly in him,If the 
Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretching

hickory, cotton-wood, orange, magnolia,Tangles as tangled in him as any 
cane-brake or swamp,He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests 
coated with northern transparent ice,Off him pasturage sweet and natural 
as savanna, up- land, prairie,Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering 
those of the fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle; His spirit
