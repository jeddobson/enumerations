73d Years of These States.1 SUDDENLY, out of its stale 
and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,Like lightning it le'pt 
forth, half startled at itself,Its feet upon the ashes and 
the rags—its hands tight to the throats of kings.2 O 
hope and faith!O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!O many 
a sicken'd heart!Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves

corpses of young men,Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets—those 
hearts pierc'd by the gray lead,Cold and motionless as they
