fail.287 Each who passes is consider'd—each who stops is consider'd—not 
a single one can it fail.288 It cannot fail the 
young man who died and was buried,Nor the young woman 
who died and was put by his side,Nor the little 
child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew

with me—I keep no account with lamentation; (What have I 
to do with lamentation?)296 I am an acme of things 
accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things to be.297 My 
feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs;On
