let it.4 The atmosphere is not a perfume—it has no 
taste of the distillation—it is odorless; It is for my 
mouth forever—I am in love with it;I will go to 
the bank by the wood, and become undis- guised and 
naked; I am mad for it to be in contact 
with me.25 The smoke of my own breath;Echoes, ripples, buzz'd 
whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine; My respiration and inspiration, 
the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and 
air through my lungs; 20 That, and here, my General's 
first battle;No women looking on, nor sunshine to bask in—it 
did not conclude with applause; Nobody clapp'd hands here then.21 
But in darkness, in mist, on the ground, under a 
chill rain,Wearied that night we lay, foil'd and sullen;While scornfully 
laugh'd many an arrogant lord, off against us encamp'd,Quite within

and damp and another day;But the night of that, mist 
lifting, rain ceasing,Silent as a ghost, while they thought they 
were sure of him, my General retreated.23 I saw him 
at the river-side,Down by the ferry, lit by torches, hastening 
the embar- cation; My General waited till the soldiers and 
wounded were all pass'd over; And then, (it was just 
ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last 
time.24 Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom;Many no doubt 
thought of capitulation.25 But when my General pass'd me,As he 
stood in his boat, and look'd toward the coming sun,I 
saw something different from capitulation.TERMINUS.26 Enough—the Centenarian's story ends;The two, 
the past and present, have interchanged;I myself, as connecter, as 
chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking. 23b LO! 
VICTRESS ON THE PEAKS! Lo! Victress on the peaks!Where thou 
standest, with mighty brow, regarding the world,(The world, O Libertad,
