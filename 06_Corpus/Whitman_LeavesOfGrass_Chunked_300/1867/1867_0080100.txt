all that concerns them,All these to me are unspeakably perfect 
miracles.5 To me the sea is a continual miracle;The fishes 
that swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—the ships, with men 
in them,What stranger miracles are there? 336 YOU FELONS ON

are acceptable to me;I walk with delinquents with passionate love;I 
feel I am of them—I belong to those convicts and 
prostitutes myself,And henceforth I will not deny them—for how can 
I deny myself? 337 MEDIUMS.THEY shall arise in the States;They

their drink water, their blood clean and clear; They shall 
enjoy materialism and the sight of products —they shall enjoy 
the sight of the beef, lumber, bread-stuffs, of Chicago, the 
great city; They shall train themselves to go in public 
to become orators and oratresses; Strong and sweet shall their 
tongues be—poems and materials of poems shall come from their 
lives —they shall be makers and finders; Of them, and
