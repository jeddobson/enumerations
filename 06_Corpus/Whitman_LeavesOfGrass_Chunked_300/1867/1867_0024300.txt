human voice; I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused 
or following; Sounds of the city, and sounds out of 
the city—sounds of the day and night; Talkative young ones 
to those that like them—the loud laugh of work-people at 
their meals; The angry base of disjointed friendship—the faint tones 
of the sick; The judge with hands tight to the

Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,The unperform'd, more 
gigantic than ever, advance, ad- vance upon me. 54a YEAR
