Missourian's, Oregonese' joys,To rise at peep of day, and pass 
forth nimbly to work,To plow land in the fall for 
winter-sown crops,To plough land in the spring for maize,To train 
orchards—to graft the trees—to gather ap- ples in the fall.29 
O the pleasure with trees!The orchard—the forest—the oak, cedar, pine, 
pekan- tree,The honey-locust, black-walnut, cottonwood, and mag- nolia.1230 O Death!O 
the beautiful touch of Death, soothing and be- numbing a 
few moments, for reasons; O that of myself, discharging my 
excrementitious body, to be burn'd, or render'd to powder, or 
buried,My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,My 
voided body, nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, 
further offices, eternal uses of the earth.1331 O to bathe 
in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore!To 
splash the water! to walk ankle-deep—to race naked along the 
shore.32 O to realize space!The plenteousness of all—that there are 
no bounds;To emerge, and be of the sky—of the sun 
and moon, and the flying clouds, as one with them.1433 
O, while I live, to be the ruler of life—not 
a slave,To meet life as a powerful conquerer,No fumes—no ennui—no 
more complaints or scornful criticisms.34 O me repellent and ugly!To 
these proud laws of the air, the water, and the 
ground, proving my interior Soul impregnable, And nothing exterior shall 
ever take command of me.35 O to attract by more 
than attraction!How it is I know not—yet behold! the something 
which obeys none of the rest,It is offensive, never defensive—yet 
how magnetic it draws.1536 O the joy of suffering!To struggle 
against great odds! to meet enemies un- daunted!To be entirely 
alone with them! to find how much one can stand!To 
look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face!To 
mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns
