brethren and lovers,I know I should be happy with them. 
I Hear it was Charged Against Me.I HEAR it was 
charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions; But 
really I am neither for nor against institutions;(What indeed have 
I in common with them?—Or what with the destruction of 
them?)Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and in every

menials, priests alarming—air breathing, water drinking, on the turf of 
the sea-beach dancing,Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chasing,Fulfilling 
our foray. O Living Always—Always Dying!O LIVING always—always dying!O the 
burials of me, past and present!O me, while I stride 
ahead, material, visible, imperi- ous as ever!O me, what I 
was for years, now dead, (I lament not —I am 
content;)O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which
