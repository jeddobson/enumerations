heavens of the love indicated to me!To rise thither with 
my inebriate Soul!To be lost, if it must be so!To 
feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness 
and freedom!With one brief hour of madness and joy. WE 
TWO—HOW LONG WE WERE FOOL'D. WE two—how long we were 
fool'd!Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;We are Nature—long

of my passions! Give me life coarse and rank!To-day, I 
go consort with nature's darlings—to-night too;I am for those who 
believe in loose delights—I share the midnight orgies of young
