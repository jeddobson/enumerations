female; For me those that have been boys, and that 
love women; For me the man that is proud, and 
feels how it stings to be slighted; For me the 
sweetheart and the old maid—for me mothers, and the mothers

how I celebrate you and myself!How my thoughts play subtly 
at the spectacles around!How the clouds pass silently overhead!How the 
earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon,
