of the incomparable feuillage of These States? 257 MANNAHATTA.1 I 
was asking for something specific and perfect for my city,Whereupon, 
lo! upsprang the aboriginal name!2 Now I see what there 
is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly, musical, 
self-sufficient; I see that the word of my city is 
that word up there,Because I see that word nested in 
nests of water-bays, superb, with tall and wonderful spires,Rich, hemm'd 
thick all around with sailships and steamships—an island sixteen miles 
long, solid- founded,Numberless crowded streets—high growths of iron, slender, strong, 
light, splendidly uprising to- ward clear skies; Tides swift and 
ample, well-loved by me, toward sun- down,The flowing sea-currents, the 
little islands, larger ad- joining islands, the heights, the villas,The 
countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the ferry-boats, the 
black sea-steam- ers, well model'd; The down-town streets, the jobbers' 
houses of busi- ness—the houses of business of the ship-mer- 
chants, and money-brokers—the river-streets; Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand 
in a week; The carts hauling goods—the manly race of 
drivers of horses—the brown-faced sailors; The summer-air, the bright sun 
shining, and the sail- ing clouds aloft; The winter snows, 
the sleigh-bells—the broken ice in the river, passing along, up 
or down, with the flood-tide or-ebb tide; The mechanics of 
the city, the masters, well-form'd, beautiful-faced, looking you straight in 
the eyes; Trottoirs throng'd—vehicles—Broadway—the women —the shops and shows,The parades, 
processions, bugles playing, flags flying, drums beating; A million people—manners 
free and superb—open voices—hospitality—the most courageous and friendly young men; 
The free city! no slaves! no owners of slaves!The beautiful 
city, the city of hurried and sparkling waters! the city 
of spires and masts!The city nested in bays! my city!The 
city of such women, I am mad to be with 
them! I will return after death to be with them!The
