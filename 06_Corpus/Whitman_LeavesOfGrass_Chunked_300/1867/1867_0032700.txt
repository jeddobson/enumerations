limbs passing safe over charr'd laths— their white foreheads whole 
and unhurt out of the flames: By the mechanic's wife 
with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person 
born; Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from 
three lusty angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists; 
The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and 
to come,Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee 
law- yers for his brother, and sit by him while

neck;Music rolls, but not from the organ;Folks are around me, 
but they are no household of mine.274 Ever the hard 
unsunk ground;Ever the eaters and drinkers—ever the upward and downward 
sun—ever the air and the ceaseless tides; Ever myself and 
my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real; Ever the old inexplicable query—ever 
that thorn'd thumb—that breath of itches and thirsts; Ever the 
vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one
