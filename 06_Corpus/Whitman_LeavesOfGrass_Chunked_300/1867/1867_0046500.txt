if I could be with you, and become your loving 
comrade; Be it as if I were with you. Be 
not too certain but I am now with you. 145 
SALUT AU MONDE!11 O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!Such gliding 
wonders! such sights and sounds!Such join'd unended links, each hook'd 
to the next!Each answering all—each sharing the earth with all.2 
What widens within you, Walt Whitman?What waves and soils exuding?What 
climes? what persons and lands are here?Who are the infants? 
some playing, some slumbering?Who are the girls? who are the 
married women?Who are the three old men going slowly with 
their arms about each others' necks?What rivers are these? what 
forests and fruits are these?What are the mountains call'd that 
rise so high in the mists?What myriads of dwellings are 
they, fill'd with dewellers?23 Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;Asia, 
Africa, Europe, are to the east—America is pro- vided for 
in the west; Banding the bulge of the earth winds 
the hot equator,Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends;Within me 
is the longest day—the sun wheels in slant- ing rings—it 
does not set for months?Stretch'd in due time within me 
the midnight sun just rises above the horizon, and sinks 
again; Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,Malaysia, Polynesia, 
and the great West Indian islands.34 What do you hear, 
Walt Whitman?5 I hear the workman singing, and the farmer's 
wife singing; I hear in the distance the sounds of 
children, and of animals early in the day; I hear 
quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and Kentucky, 
hunting on hills; I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing 
the wild horse; I hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, 
in the chest- nut shade, to the rebeck and guitar; 
I hear continual echoes from the Thames;I hear fierce French
