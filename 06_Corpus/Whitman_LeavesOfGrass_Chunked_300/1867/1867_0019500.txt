dusk, near the cotton- wood or pekan-trees; Coon-seekers go through 
the regions of the Red river, or through those drain'd 
by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansaw; Torches 
shine in the dark that hangs on the Chatta- hooche 
or Altamahaw; Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons 
and great-grandsons around them; In walls of adobie, in canvas 
tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day's sport; The 
city sleeps, and the country sleeps;6 Open the envelope quickly;O 
this is not our son's writing, yet his name is 
sign'd;O a strange hand writes for our dear son—O stricken 
mother's soul!All swims before her eyes—flashes with black—she catches the 
main words only; Sentences broken— gun-shot wound in the breast, 
cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital, At present low, but will 
soon be better .7 Ah, now the single figure to 
me,Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio, with all its cities 
and farms,Sickly white in the face and dull in the 
head, very faint,By the jamb of a door leans.8 Grieve 
not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through her 
sobs; The little sisters huddle around, speechless and dis- may'd;) 
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be 
better .9 Alas, poor boy, he will never be better, 
(nor may-be needs to be better, that brave and simple 
soul;)While they stand at home at the door, he is 
dead already;The only son is dead.10 But the mother needs 
to be better;She, with thin form, presently drest in black;By 
day her meals untouch'd—then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,In 
the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,O that 
she might withdraw unnoticed—silent from life, escape and withdraw,To follow, 
to seek, to be with her dear dead son.The living 
sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time;
