trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages, 
with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind; Where apples ripe 
in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd vines; 
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?Smell

pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and 
the winter-grain falls in the ground; Off on the lakes 
the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the 
frozen surface; The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the 
squatter strikes deep with his axe; Flatboatmen make fast, towards
