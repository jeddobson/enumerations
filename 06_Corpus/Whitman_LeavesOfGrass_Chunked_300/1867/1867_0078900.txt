moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.3 
I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, 
turns a casual look upon you, and then averts his 
face,Leaving it to you to prove and define it,Expecting the 
main things from you. 318 ME IMPERTURBE.ME imperturbe, standing at 
ease in Nature,Master of all, or mistress of all—aplomb in

the spirit that trails in the lines under- foot,In the 
rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and 
all the land of the globe.3 Fascinated, my eyes, reverting 
from the south, drop't, to follow those slender winrows,Chaff, straw,
