ship from its wreck- place.4 For, as on the alert, 
O steersman, you mind the bell's admonition,The bows turn,—the freighted 
ship, tacking, speeds away under her gray sails,The beautiful and 
noble ship, with all her precious wealth, speeds away gaily

All characters, movements, growths—a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,Through Mannahatta's streets 
I walking, these things gathering; On interior rivers, by night, 
in the glare of pine knots, steamboats wooding up; Sunlight 
by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on 
the valleys of the Potomac and Rappa- hannock, and the 
valleys of the Roanoke and Delaware; In their northerly wilds
