surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil,1031 Of 
mankind, the poet is the equable man,Not in him, but 
off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their 
full returns,Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in 
its place is bad,He bestows on every object or quality

silent,He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue 
and denouement,He sees eternity in men and women—he does not 
see men and women as dreams or dots.32 For the 
great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,For that 
idea, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders, STARTING 
FROM PAUMANOK.11 STARTING from fish-shape Paumanok, where I was born,Well-begotten, 
and rais'd by a perfect mother;After roaming many lands—lover of 
populous pave- ments; Dweller in Mannahatta, city of ships, my 
city—or on southern savannas; Or a soldier camp'd, or carrying 
my knapsack and gun —or a miner in California; Or
