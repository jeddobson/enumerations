beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks, the hills—or lapping the 
Saginaw waters to drink; In a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, 
lost from the flock, sitting on the water, rocking silently; 
In farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest la- 
bor done—they rest standing—they are too tired; Afar on arctic 
ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily, while her cubs play around; 
The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd—the farthest 
polar sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes; White drift 
spooning ahead, where the ship in the tempest dashes; On 
solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells 
all strike midnight together; In primitive woods, the sounds there

the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk; In 
winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake—in summer 
visible through the clear waters, the great trout swimming; In 
lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the large 
black buzzard floating slowly, high beyond the tree tops,Below, the 
red cedar, festoon'd with tylandria—the pines and cypresses, growing out 
of the white sand that spreads far and flat; Rude 
boats descending the big Pedee—climbing plants, parasites, with color'd flowers 
and ber- ries, enveloping huge trees,The waving drapery on the 
live oak, trailing long and low, noiselessly waved by the 
wind; The camp of Georgia wagoners, just after dark—the supper-fires, 
and the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,Thirty or 
forty great wagons—the mules, cattle, horses, feeding from troughs,The shadows, 
gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees—the flames—also 
the black smoke from the pitch-pine, curling and rising; Southern 
fishermen fishing—the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's coast—the shad-fishery 
and the herring-fishery—the large sweep-seines— the windlasses on shore work'd 
by horses—the clearing, curing, and packing-houses; Deep in the forest,
