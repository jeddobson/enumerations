(never again on earth responding;)Vigil for comrade swiftly slain—vigil I 
never forget, how as day brighten'd,I rose from the chill 
ground, and folded my soldier well in his blanket,And buried 
him where he fell. 43a BATHED IN WAR'S PERFUME.BATHED in 
war's perfume—delicate flag!O to hear you call the sailors and

hair, counsell'd with doctors, and calculated close,I find no sweeter 
fat then sticks to my own bones.99 In all people 
I see myself—none more, and not one a barley-corn less;
