FOIL'D REVOLTER OR REVOLTRESS.1 COURAGE! my brother or my sister!Keep 
on! Liberty is to be subserved, whatever occurs;That is nothing, 
that is quell'd by one or two failures, or any 
number of failures,Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the 
people, or by any unfaithfulness,Or the show of the tushes 
of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.2 What we believe in 
waits latent forever through all the continents, and all the 
islands and archi- pelagos of the sea.3 What we believe

place, it is not the first to go, nor the 
second or third to go,It waits for all the rest

the souls of men and women are discharged from any 
part of the earth,Then only shall liberty be discharged from 
that part of the earth,And the infidel and the tyrant 
come into possession.7 Then courage! revolter! revoltress!For till all ceases, 
neither must you cease.8 I do not know what you
