also here.6 Here is the profound lesson of reception, neither 
preference or denial; The black with his woolly head, the 
felon, the dis- eas'd, the illiterate person, are not denied; 
The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, 
the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,The escaped youth,

you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof 
would be evident and amicable with me.49 The earth expanding
