you;You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still 
in your room.59 Dancing and laughing along the beach came 
the twenty-ninth bather; The rest did not see her, but 
she saw them and loved them.60 The beards of the 
young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long 
hair; Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.61 An unseen 
hand also pass'd over their bodies;It descended tremblingly from their 
temples and ribs.62 The young men float on their backs—their 
white bellies bulge to the sun—they do not ask who 
seizes fast to them; They do not know who puffs 
and declines with pen- dant and bending arch; They do 
not think whom they souse with spray.The hurt and the

much—I recall the experience sweet and sad; (Many a soldier's 
loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,Many a 
soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.) 34a WHEN I

unaccountable, I became tired and sick;Till rising and gliding out, 
I wander'd off by myself,In the mystical moist night-air, and

stars.I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,I announce the justification of 
candor, and the justi- fication of pride.6 I announce that 
the identity of These States is a single identity only,I 
announce the Union more and more compact,I announce splendors and 
majesties to make all the previous politics of the earth
