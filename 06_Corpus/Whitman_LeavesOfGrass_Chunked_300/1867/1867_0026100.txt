halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to 
lose —yet this sign left,On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd 
on the tree by the grave, Bold, cautious, true, and 
my loving comrade .2 Long, long I muse, then on 
my way go wandering;Many a changeful season to follow, and 
many a scene of life; Yet at times through changeful 
season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in the crowded street,Comes 
before me the unknown soldier's grave—comes the inscription rude in 
Virginia's woods, Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade .In 
vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my 
approach; In vain the mastadon retreats beneath its own pow- 
der'd bones; In vain objects stand leagues off, and assume 
manifold shapes; In vain the ocean settling in hollows, and 
the great monsters lying low; In vain the buzzard houses 
herself with the sky;In vain the snake slides through the 
creepers and logs; In vain the elk takes to the 
inner passes of the woods;In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails 
far north to Labrador;I follow quickly, I ascend to the 
nest in the fissure of the cliff.32187 I think I 
could turn and live with animals, they are so placid 
and self-contain'd; I stand and look at them long and 
long.188 They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They 
do not lie awake in the dark and weep for 
their sins; They do not make me sick discussing their 
duty to God; Not one is dissatisfied—not one is demented 
with the mania of owning things; Not one kneels to 
another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years 
ago; Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole 
earth.189 So they show their relations to me, and I 
accept them; They bring me tokens of myself—they evince them
