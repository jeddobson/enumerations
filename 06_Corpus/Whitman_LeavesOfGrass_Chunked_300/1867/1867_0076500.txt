to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew me.2 
O how can the ground not sicken?How can you be 
alive, you growths of spring?How can you furnish health, you 
blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?Are they not continually putting 
distemper'd corpses in you?Is not every continent work'd over and 
over with sour dead?3 Where have you disposed of their 
carcasses?Those drunkards and gluttons of so many genera- tions; Where 
have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?I 
do not see any of it upon you to-day—or perhaps 
I am deceiv'd; I will run a furrow with my 
plough—I will press my spade through the sod, and turn 
it up under- neath; I am sure I shall expose 
some of the foul meat.4 Behold this compost! behold it 
well!Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick 
person—Yet behold!The grass covers the prairies,The bean bursts noiselessly through 
the mould in the garden,The delicate spear of the onion 
pierces upward,The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,The resurrection of 
the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,The 
tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mul- berry-tree,The he-birds 
carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit on their 
nests,The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,The new-born 
of animals appear—the calf is dropt from the cow, the 
colt from the mare,Out of its little hill faithfully rise 
the potato's dark green leaves,Out of its hill rises the 
yellow maize-stalk;The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all 
those strata of sour dead.5 What chemistry!That the winds are 
really not infectious,That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash 
of the sea, which is so amorous after me,That it 
is safe to allow it to lick my naked body 
all over with its tongues,That it will not endanger me
