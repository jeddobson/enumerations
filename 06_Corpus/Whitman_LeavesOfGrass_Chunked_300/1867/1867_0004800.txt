always finally befallen, each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist, infidel, 
who has ever ask'd anything of America?What mocking and scornful 
negligence?The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;By the roadside 
others disdainfully toss'd.1341 Rhymes and rhymers pass away—poems distill'd from 
other poems pass away,The swarms of reflectors and the polite 
pass, and leave ashes; Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but 
the soil of literature; America justifies itself, give it time—no 
disguise can deceive it, or conceal from it—it is impassive

seen the he-bird also;I have paused to hear him, near 
at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully singing.40 And while 
I paused, it came to me that what he really 
sang for was not there only,Nor for his mate nor 
himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes; But 
subtle, clandestine, away beyond,A charge transmitted, and gift occult, for 
those being born.1341 Democracy!Near at hand to you a throat 
is now inflating itselfand joyfully singing.42 Ma femme!For the brood
