of their works, shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey gospels; 
Characters, events, retrospections, shall be convey'd in gospels—Trees, animals, waters, 
shall be convey'd,Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all 
be con- vey'd. 338NOW LIFT ME CLOSE. Now lift me 
close to your face till I whisper,What you are holding 
is in reality no book, nor part of a book;

long! —We must separate awhile—Here! take from my lips this 
kiss; Whoever you are, I give it especially to you; 
So long! —And I hope we shall meet again.
