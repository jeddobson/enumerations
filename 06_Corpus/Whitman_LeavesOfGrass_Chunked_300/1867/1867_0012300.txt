the arrived models, the Athletes, The States—or see freedom or 
spirituality—or hold any faith in results,(But I see the Athletes—and 
I see the results glorious and inevitable—and they again leading 
to other results;)How the great cities appear—How the Democratic masses, 
turbulent, wilful, as I love them,How the whirl, the contest, 
the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and resounding, 
keep on and on; How society waits unform'd, and is 
between things ended and things begun; How America is the 
continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom, and 
of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and

stealthy tread,Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels, swell- ing 
the house with their plenty,Shall I postpone my acceptation and 
realization, and scream at my eyes,That they turn from gazing 
after and down the road,And forthwith cipher and show me 
a cent,Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents 
of two, and which is ahead?419 Trippers and askers surround 
me;People I meet—the effect upon me of my early life, 
or the ward and city I live in, or the 
nation,The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,My 
dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,The real or fancied indifference 
of some man or woman I love,The sickness of one
