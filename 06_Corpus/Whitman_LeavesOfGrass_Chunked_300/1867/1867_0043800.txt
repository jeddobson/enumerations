fields when the winter breaks up,Love-buds, put before you and 
within you, whoever you are,Buds to be unfolded on the 
old terms;If you bring the warmth of the sun to 
them, they will open, and bring form, color, perfume, to 
you; If you become the aliment and the wet, they 
will become flowers, fruits, tall branches and trees. Not Heat 
Flames up and Consumes.NOT heat flames up and consumes,Not sea-waves 
hurry in and out,Not the air, delicious and dry, the

all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops; Let 
it all be seen in your light, blushing drops. Of 
Him I Love Day and Night.OF him I love day 
and night, I dream'd I heard he was dead; And 
I dream'd I went where they had buried him I
