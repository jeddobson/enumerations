SONG AT SUNSET.1 SPLENDOR of ended day, floating and filling 
me!Hour prophetic—hour resuming the past!Inflating my throat—you, divine average!You, Earth 
and Life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.2 Open 
mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,Eyes of my Soul, seeing 
perfection,Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;Corroborating forever the triumph 
of things.3 Illustrious every one!Illustrious what we name space—sphere of 
unnum- ber'd spirits; Illustrious the mystery of motion, in all

just as lucky to die, and I know it.40 I 
pass death with the dying, and birth with the new 
wash'd babe, and am not contain'd between my- hat and 
boots; And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every 
one good; The earth good, and the stars good, and 
their adjuncts all good.41 I am not an earth, nor 
an adjunct of an earth;I am the mate and companion 
of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself; 
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)42 Every 
kind for itself and its own—for me mine, male and
