3c AS I SAT ALONE BY BLUE ONTARIO'S SHORE.11 As 
I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore,As I mused of 
these mighty days, and of peace re- turn'd, and the 
dead that return no more,A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern 
visage, ac- cost'd me; Chant me a poem, it said, 
of the range of the high Soul of Poets, And 
chant of the welcome bards that breathe but my native 
air—invoke those bards; And chant me, before you go, the 
Song of the throes of Democracy .2 (Democracy—the destined conqueror—yet 
treacher- ous lip-smiles everywhere,And Death and infidelity at every step.)23 
A nation announcing itself,I myself make the only growth by 
which I can be ap- preciated,I reject none, accept all, 
then reproduce all in my own forms.4 A breed whose 
proof is in time and deeds;What we are, we are—nativity 
is answer enough to objections; We wield ourselves as a 
weapon is wielded,We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,We are 
executive in ourselves—We are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,We 
are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in our- selves; 
We stand self-pois'd, in the middle, branching thence over the 
world; From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.5 
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,Whatever appears, whatever 
does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves 
only.(O mother! O sisters dear!If we are lost, no victor 
else has destroy'd us;It is by ourselves we go down 
to eternal night.)37 Have you thought there could be but 
a single Supreme?There can be any number of Supremes—One does 
not countervail another, any more than one eye- sight countervails 
another, or one life counter- vails another.8 All is eligible 
to all,All is for individuals—All is for you,No condition is 
prohibited, not God's, or any.9 All comes by the body—only
