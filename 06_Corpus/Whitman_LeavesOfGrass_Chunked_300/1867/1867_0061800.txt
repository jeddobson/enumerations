you; What beckonings of love you receive, you shall only 
answer with passionate kisses of parting,You shall not allow the 
hold of those who spread their reach'd hands toward you.1241 
Allons! After the GREAT COMPANIONS! and to belong to them!They 
too are on the road! they are the swift and 
majestic men! they are the greatest women.42 Over that which 
hinder'd them—over that which retarded—passing impediments large or small,Committers of 
crimes, committers of many beautiful virtues,Enjoyers of calms of seas, 
and storms of seas,Sailors of many a ship, walkers of 
many a mile of land,Habitués of many different countries, habitués

unsur- pass'd, content,Journeyers with their own sublime old age of 
man- hood or womanhood,Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the 
haughty breadth of the universe,Old age, flowing free with the 
delicious near-by free- dom of death.1343 Allons! To that which 
is endless, as it was begin- ningless,To undergo much, tramps 
of days, rests of nights,To merge all in the travel 
they tend to, and the days and nights they tend 
to,Again to merge them in the start of superior jour- 
neys; To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach 
it and pass it,To conceive no time, however distant, but 
what you may reach it and pass it,To look up
