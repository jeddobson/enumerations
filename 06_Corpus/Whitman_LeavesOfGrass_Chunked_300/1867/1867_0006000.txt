year of the struggle!No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses 
for you, terrible year!Not you as some pale poetling, seated 
at a desk, lisp- ing cadenzas piano; But as a 
strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a 
rifle on your shoulder,With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and 
hands— with a knife in the belt at your side,As 
I heard you shouting loud—your sonorous voice ringing across the 
continent; Your masculine voice, O year, as rising amid the

all? what were God?)Essence of forms—life of the real identities, 
permanent, positive, (namely the unseen,)Life of the great round world, 
the sun and stars, and of man—I, the general Soul,Here 
the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,Breathe my 
breath also through these little songs. 17b NOT MY ENEMIES 
EVER INVADE ME.NOT my enemies ever invade me—no harm to 
my pride from them I fear; But the lovers I 
recklessly love—lo! how they master me!Lo! me, ever open and
