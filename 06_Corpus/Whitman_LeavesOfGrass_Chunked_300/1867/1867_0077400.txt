stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill 
the seats of the boats,All offering of substance or life 
for the good old cause, or for a friend's sake, 
or opinion's sake,All pains of enthusiasts, scoffed at by their 
neighbors,All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,All 
honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unre- corded,All the

coming a bit nearer the beginning than any.11 Whatever satisfies 
Souls is true;Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of 
Souls; Itself only finally satisfies the Soul;The Soul has that 
measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own.12 
Now I give you an inkling;Now I breathe the word 
of the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,That 
answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.13 
What is prudence, is indivisible,Declines to separate one part of
