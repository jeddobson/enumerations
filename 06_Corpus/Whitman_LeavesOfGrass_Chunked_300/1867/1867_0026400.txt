plainly in their possession. 59a HYMN OF DEAD SOLDIERS.1 ONE 
breath, O my silent soul,A perfum'd thought—no more I ask, 
for the sake of all dead soldiers.2 Buglers off in 
my armies!At present I ask not you to sound;Not at 
the head of my cavalry, all on their spirited horses,With 
their sabres drawn and glist'ning, and carbines clanking by their 
thighs—(ah, my brave horse- men!My handsome, tan-faced horsemen! what life, 
what joy and pride,With all the perils, were yours!)3 Nor 
you drummers—neither at reveille, at dawn,Nor the long roll alarming 
the camp—nor even the muffled beat for a burial; Nothing 
from you, this time, O drummers, bearing my warlike drums.4 
But aside from these, and the crowd's hurrahs, and the 
land's congratulations,Admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the the 
rest, and voiceless,I chant this chant of my silent soul, 
in the name of all dead soldiers.5 Faces so pale, 
with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet;Draw close, but 
speak not.190 I wonder where they get those tokens:Did I 
pass that way huge times ago, and negligently drop them?Myself 
moving forward then and now and forever,Gathering and showing more 
always and with velocity,Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of 
these among them; Not too exclusive toward the reachers of 
my remem- brancers; Picking out here one that I love, 
and now go with him on brotherly terms.191 A gigantic 
beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,Head 
high in the forehead, wide between the ears,Limbs glossy and 
supple, tail dusting the ground,Eyes well apart, full of sparkling 
wickedness—ears finely cut, flexibly moving.192 His nostrils dilate, as my 
heels embrace him;His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we 
speed around and return.193 I but use you a moment, 
then I resign you, stallion;Why do I need your paces,
