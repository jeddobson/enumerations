the world;Some are in storms—some in the night, with the 
watch on the lookout; Some drifting helplessly—some with contagious dis- 
eases.10 I behold the sail and steamships of the world, 
some in clusters in port, some on their voyages; Some 
double the Cape of Storms—some Cape Verde, —others Cape Guardafui, 
Bon, or Bajadore; Others Dondra Head—others pass the Straits of 
Sun- da—others Cape Lopatka—others Behring's Straits; Others Cape Horn—others the 
Gulf of Mexico, or along Cuba or Hayti—others Hudson's Bay 
or Baffin's Bay; Others pass the Straits of Dover—others enter 
the Wash—others the Firth of Solway—others round Cape Clear—others the 
Land's End; Others traverse the Zuyder Zee, or the Scheld;Others 
add to the exits and entrances at Sandy Hook;Others to 
the comers and goers at Gibraltar, or the Dardanelles; Others 
sternly push their way through the northern winter-packs; Others descend 
or ascend the Obi or the Lena:Others the Niger or 
the Congo—others the Indus, the Burampooter and Cambodia; Others wait 
at the wharves of Manhattan, steam'd up, ready to start; 
Wait, swift and swarthy, in the ports of Australia;Wait at 
Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lis- bon, Naples, Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, 
the Hague, Copenhagen; Wait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama;Wait at 
their moorings at Boston, Philadelphia, Balti- more, Charleston, New Orleans, 
Galveston, San Francisco.511 I see the tracks of the rail-roads

Britain, I see them in Europe;I see them in Asia 
and in Africa.12 I see the electric telegraphs of the 
earth;I see the filaments of the news of the wars, 
deaths, losses, gains, passions, of my race.13 I see the 
long river-stripes of the earth;I see where the Mississippi flows—I 
see where the Columbia flows; I see the Great River,
