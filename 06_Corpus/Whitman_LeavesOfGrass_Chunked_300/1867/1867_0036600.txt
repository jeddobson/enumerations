all else to us? only that we enjoy each other, 
and exhaust each other, if it must be so;)—From the 
master—the pilot I yield the vessel to;The general commanding me, 
commanding all—from him permission taking; From time the programme hastening, 
(I have loiter'd too long, as to is;)From sex—From the

close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting 
with excess; From what the divine husband knows—from the work 
of fatherhood; From exultation, victory, and relief—from the bedfel- low's 
embrace in the night; From the act-poems of eyes, hands, 
hips, and bosoms,From the cling of the trembling arm,From the 
bending curve and the clinch,From side by side, the pliant 
coverlid off-throwing,From the one so unwilling to have me leave—and 
me just as unwilling to leave,(Yet a moment, O tender 
waiter, and I return;)—From the hour of shining stars and 
dropping dews,From the night, a moment, I, emerging, flitting out,Celebrate 
you, act divine—and you, children prepared for,And you, stalwart loins.

them; They will not let me off till I go 
with them, respond to them,And discorrupt them, and charge them 
full with the charge of the Soul.2 Was it doubted 
that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?And if 
those who defile the living are as bad as they
