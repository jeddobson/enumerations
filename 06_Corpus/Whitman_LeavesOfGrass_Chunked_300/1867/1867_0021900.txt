Sea of stretch'd ground-swells!Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!Sea of 
the brine of life! sea of unshovell'd yet always- ready 
graves!Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty sea!I am 
integral with you—I too am of one phase, and of 
all phases.117 Partaker of influx and efflux I—extoller of hate 
and conciliation; Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in 
each others' arms.118 I am he attesting sympathy;(Shall I make 
my list of things in the house, and skip the 
house that supports them?) 47a GIVE ME THE SPLENDID SILENT 
SUN.1GIVE me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams 
full- dazzling; Give me juicy autumnal fruit, ripe and red 
from the orchard; Give me a field where the unmow'd 
grass grows;Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape;Give 
me fresh corn and wheat—give me serene-moving animals, teaching content; 
Give me nights perfectly quiet, as on high plateaus west 
of the Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars; 
Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers, 
where I can walk undisturb'd; Give me for marriage a 
sweet-breath'd woman, of whom I should never tire; Give me 
a perfect child—give me, away, aside from the noise of 
the world, a rural domestic life; Give me to warble 
spontaneous songs, reliev'd, recluse by myself, for my own ears 
only; Give me solitude—give me Nature—give me again, O Nature, 
your primal sanities!—These, demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless 
excitement, and rack'd by the war-strife;)These to procure, incessantly asking, 
rising in cries from my heart,While yet incessantly asking, still 
I adhere to my city;Day upon day, and year upon 
year, O city, walking your streets,Where you hold me enchain'd 
a certain time, refusing to give me up; Yet giving 
to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul—you give me forever
