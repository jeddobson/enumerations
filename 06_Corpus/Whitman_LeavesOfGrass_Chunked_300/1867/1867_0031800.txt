the last gasp; My face is ash-color'd—my sinews gnarl—away from 
me people retreat.244 Askers embody themselves in me, and I 
am embo- died in them; I project my hat, sit 
shame-faced, and beg.38245 Enough! enough! enough!Somehow I have been stunn'd. 
Stand back!Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, 
slumbers, dreams, gaping; I discover myself on the verge of 
a usual mistake.246 That I could forget the mockers and 
insults!That I could forget the trickling tears, and the blows 
of the bludgeons and hammers!That I could look with a 
separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.247 I 
remember now;I resume the overstaid fraction;The grave of rock multiplies

country? Iowa, Oregon, California? the mountains? prairie-life, bush- life? or 
from the sea?252 Wherever he goes, men and women accept 
and de- sire him; They desire he should like them, 
touch them, speak to them, stay with them.253 Behavior lawless 
as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd head, laughter, and 
naiveté,Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations; They descend 
in new forms from the tips of his fingers; They 
are wafted with the odor of his body or breath
