and shows, all the workmen at their work,All the seamen 
and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves, Pioneers! 
O pioneers!17 All the hapless silent lovers,All the prisoners in 
the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,All the joyous, 
all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying, Pioneers! 
O pioneers!18 I too with my soul and body,We, a 
curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,Through these shores, amid 
the shadows, with the apparitions pressing, Pioneers! O pioneers!19 Lo! 
the darting bowling orb!Lo! the brother orbs around! all the 
clustering suns and planets; All the dazzling days, all the 
mystic nights with dreams, Pioneers! O pioneers! 28c AS I 
WALK, SOLITARY, UNATTENDED.1 AS I walk, solitary, unattended,Around me I 
hear that eclat of the world—politics, produce,The announcements of recognized 
things—science,The approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions.2 
I see the ships, (they will last a few years,)The 
vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,And hear the indorsement 
of all, and do not object to it.3 But we 
too announce solid things;Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not 
nothing —they serve,They stand for realities—all is as it should 
be.4 Then my realities;What else is so real as mine?Libertad, 
and the divine average—Freedom to every slave on the face 
of the earth,The rapt promises and luminé of seers—the spiritual 
world—these centuries-lasting songs,And our visions, the visions of poets, the 
most solid announcements of any.5 For we support all,After the 
rest is done and gone, we remain;There is no final 
reliance but upon us;Democracy rests finally upon us, (I, my 
brethren, begin it,)And our visions sweep through eternity.It may be 
you are from old people, and from women, and from 
offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps; And here 
you are the mothers' laps.33 This grass is very dark
