than prayer;This head more than churches, bibles, and all the 
creeds.143 If I worship one thing more than another, it 
shall be the spread of my own body, or any 
part of it.144 Translucent mould of me, it shall be 
you!Shaded ledges and rests, it shall be you!Firm masculine colter, 
it shall be you.145 Whatever goes to the tilth of

to consider if it really be; A morning-glory at my 
window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.152 To 
behold the day-break!The little light fades the immense and diaphanous 
shadows; The air tastes good to my palate.153 Hefts of
