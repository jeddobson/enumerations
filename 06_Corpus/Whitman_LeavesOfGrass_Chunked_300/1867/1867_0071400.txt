Souls!Let the love that waits in them, wait! Let it 
die, or pass still-born to other spheres!Let the sympathy that 
waits in every man, wait! or let it also pass, 
a dwarf, to other spheres!Let contradictions prevail! Let one thing

who can tyrannize, let him tyrannize to his satisfaction!Let none

hate, greed, indecency, impotence, lust, be taken for granted above 
all! Let writers, judges, gov- ernments, households, religions, philosophies, take 
such for granted above all!Let the worst men beget children 
out of the worst women!Let the priest still play at 
immortality!Let death be inaugurated!Let nothing remain but the ashes of 
teachers, artists, moralists, lawyers, and learn'd and polite per- sons!Let 
him who is without my poems be assassinated!Let the cow,
