and I to listen and tell.THE CENTENARIAN.6 When I clutch'd 
your hand, it was not with terror;But suddenly, pouring about 
me here, on every side,And below there where the boys 
were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,And where tents 
are pitch'd, and wherever you see, south and south-east and 
south-west,Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,And 
along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over,) came again,

they pass'd, long lapsed—faces and trenches and fields; Long through 
the carnage I moved with a callous compos- ure—or away 
from the fallen,Onward I sped at the time—But now of 
their forms at night, I dream, I dream, I dream. 
20b AN ARMY ON THE MARCH.WITH its cloud of skirmishers 
in advance,With now the sound of a single shot, snapping 
like a whip, and now an irregular volley,The swarming ranks 
press on and on, the dense brigades press on; Glittering
