you squat and stifle there?)11 The earth does not argue,Is 
not pathetic, has no arrangements,Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, 
promise,Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,Closes nothing, refuses nothing, 
shuts none out,Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies,

day and night tirelessly before her own face.16 Seen at 
hand, or seen at a distance,Duly the twenty-four appear in 
public every day,Duly approach and pass with their companions, or 
a companion,Looking from no countenances of their own, but from 
the countenances of those who are with them,From the countenances 
of children or women, or the manly countenance,From the open 
countenances of animals, or from in- animate things,From the landscape 
or waters, or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,From
