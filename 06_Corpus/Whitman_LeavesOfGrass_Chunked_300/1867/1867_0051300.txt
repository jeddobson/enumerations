the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner 
than I sing the songs of the glory of you.10 
Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!These shows 
of the east and west are tame compared to you; 
These immense meadows—these interminable rivers— you are immense and interminable 
as they; These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes 
of apparent dissolution—you are he or she who is master 
or mistress over them,Master or mistress in your own right 
over Nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution.11 The hopples fall from 
your ankles—you find an un- failing sufficiency; Old or young, 
male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever 
you are promulges itself; Through birth, life, death, burial, the 
means are pro- vided, nothing is scanted; Through angers, losses, 
ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks it way. 168 
BEGINNERS.How they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at 
intervals;)How dear and dreadful they are to the earth;How they 
inure to themselves as much as to any— What a 
paradox appears, their age; How people respond to them, yet 
know them not;How there is something relentless in their fate, 
all times; How all times mischoose the objects of their 
adulation and reward,And how the same inexorable price must still 
be paid for the same great purchase. 168 TESTS.ALL submit 
to them, where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to analysis, 
in the Soul; Not traditions—not the outer authorities are the 
judges—they are the judges of outer authori- ties, and of 
all traditions; They corroborate as they go, only whatever corrobo- 
rates themselves, and touches themselves; For all that, they have 
it forever in themselves to corroborate far and near, without 
one excep- tion. 168 PERFECTIONS.ONLY themselves understand themselves, and the 
like of themselves,As Souls only understand Souls. 182 WITH ANTECEDENTS.1
