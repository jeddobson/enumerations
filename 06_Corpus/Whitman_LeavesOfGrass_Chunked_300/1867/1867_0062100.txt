or down no road but it stretches and waits for 
you—however long, but it stretches and waits for you; To 
see no being, not God's or any, but you also 
go thither,To see no possession but you may possess it—enjoy- 
ing all without labor or purchase—abstracting the feast, yet not 
abstracting one particle of it; To take the best of 
the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant villa, and 
the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and the fruits 
of or- chards and flowers of gardens,To take to your 
use out of the compact cities as you pass through,To 
carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,To 
gather the minds of men out of their brains as 
you encounter them—to gather the love out of their hearts,To 
take your lovers on the road with you, for all 
that you leave them behind you,To know the universe itself 
as a road—as many roads —as roads for traveling souls.1444

of the soul.45 All parts away for the progress of 
souls;All religion, all solid things, arts, governments,—all that was or 
is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into 
niches and corners before the procession of Souls along the 
grand roads of the universe.46 Of the progress of the 
souls of men and women along the grand roads of 
the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and 
sus- tenance.47 Forever alive, forever forward,Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, 
mad, turbu- lent, feeble, dissatisfied,Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by 
men, re- jected by men,They go! they go! I know 
that they go, but I know not where they go;
