by vermin and worms,And this is some murderer's knife with 
a half-pull'd scabbard.10 This face owes to the sexton his 
dismalest fee;An unceasing death-bell tolls there.311 Those then are really 
men—the bosses and tufts of the great round globe!12 Features 
of my equals, would you trick me with your creas'd 
and cadaverous march?Well, you cannot trick me.13 I see your 
rounded never-erased flow;I see neath the rims of your haggard

a life-boat;This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks 
no odds of the rest; This face is flavor'd fruit,

the programme of all good.19 These faces bear testimony slumbering 
or awake;They show their descent from the Master himself.20 Off 
the word I have spoken I except not one—red, white, 
black, are all deific; In each house is the ovum—it 
comes forth after a thousand years.21 Spots or cracks at
