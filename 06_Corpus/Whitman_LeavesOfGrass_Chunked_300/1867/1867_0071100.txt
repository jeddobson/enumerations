with perfect nonchalance!To be indeed a God!37 O the gleesome 
saunter over fields and hill-sides!The leaves and flowers of the 
commonest weeds—the moist fresh stillness of the woods,The exquisite smell 
of the earth at day-break, and all through the forenoon.38 
O love-branches! love-root! love-apples!O chaste and electric torrents! O mad-sweet

advance to the front and speak; Let murderers, thieves, bigots, 
fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions!Let the old propositions be 
postponed!Let faces and theories be turn'd inside out! Let meanings 
be freely criminal, as well as results!Let there be no 
suggestion above the suggestion of drudgery!Let none be pointed toward 
his destination! (Say! do you know your destination?)Let trillions of 
men and women be mock'd with bodies and mock'd with
