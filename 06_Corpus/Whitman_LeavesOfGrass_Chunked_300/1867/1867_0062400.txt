But I know that they go toward the best—toward something 
great.1548 Allons! Whoever you are! come forth!You must not stay 
sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built 
it, or though it has been built for you.49 Allons! 
out of the dark confinement!It is useless to protest—I know 
all, and expose it.50 Behold, through you as bad as 
the rest,Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,Inside of 
dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces,Behold 
a secret silent loathing and despair.51 No husband, no wife, 
no friend, trusted to hear the confession; Another self, a 
duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,Formless and 
wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland 
in the parlors,In the cars of rail-roads, in steamboats, in 
the public assembly,Home to the houses of men and women, 
at the table, in the bed-room everywhere,Smartly attired, countenance smiling, 
form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,Under 
the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers,Keeping 
fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,Speaking 
of anything else, but never of itself.1652 Allons! Through struggles 
and wars!The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.53 Have 
the past struggles succeeded?What has succeeded? Yourself? Your nation? Na- 
ture?Now understand me well—It is provided in the es- sence 
of things, that from any fruition of suc- cess, no 
matter what, shall come forth some- thing to make a 
greater struggle necessary.54 My call is the call of battle—I 
nourish active re- bellion?He going with me must go well 
armed;He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, 
angry enemies, desertions.1755 Allons! The road is before us!It is 
safe—I have tried it—my own feet have tried it well.56 
Allons! Be not detain'd!Let the paper remain on the desk
