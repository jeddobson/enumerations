of all, how per- fect!But as for me, for you, 
the irresistible sea is to separ- ate us,As for an 
hour carrying us diverse—yet cannot carry us diverse for ever; 
Be not impatient—a little space—know you, I salute the air, 
the ocean and the land,Every day, at sundown, for your

old artillerist—I tell of my fort's bombard- ment; I am 
there again.214 Again the long roll of the drummers;Again the 
attacking cannon, mortars;Again the cannon responsive. 68a I SAW OLD
