much as any.309 I open my scuttle at night and 
see the far-sprinkled systems,And all I see, multiplied as high 
as I can cipher, edge but the rim of the 
farther systems.310 Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,Outward

no man to a dinner-table, library, or exchange;But each man 
and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,My 
left hand hooking you round the waist,My right hand pointing
