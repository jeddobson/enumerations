and women like you.26 The sum of all known reverence 
I add up in you, whoever you are; The President 
is there in the White House for you— it is 
not you who are here for him; The Secretaries act 
in their bureaus for you—not you here for them; The 
Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you;Laws, courts, the forming of 
States, the charters of cities, the going and coming of 
commerce and mails, are all for you.27 List close, my 
scholars dear!All doctrines, all politics and civilization, exurge from you; 
All sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are tallied

the beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer 
singing his sweet romanza—nor that of the men's chorus, nor 
that of the wo- men's chorus,It is nearer and farther 
than they.630 Will the whole come back then?Can each see

with you, with the mystic, unseen Soul?31 Strange and hard 
that paradox true I give;Objects gross and the unseen Soul 
are one.32 House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering,
