rude in my home in Dakotah's woods, my diet meat, 
my drink from the spring; Or withdrawn to muse and 
meditate in some deep recess,Far from the clank of crowds, 
intervals passing, rapt and happy; Aware of the fresh free

group, each person, a picture—the negligent rest on the saddles; 
Some emerge on the opposite bank—others are just entering the 
ford; The guidon flags flutter gaily in the wind.Surrounding the 
essences of real things, old times and present times,Surrounding just 
found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements,
