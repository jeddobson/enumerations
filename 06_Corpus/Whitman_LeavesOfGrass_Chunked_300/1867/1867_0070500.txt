weapon dart from his vigorous arm; O swift, again, now, 
far out in the ocean, the wounded whale, settling, running 
to windward, tows me,Again I see him rise to breathe—We 
row close again,I see a lance driven through his side, 
press'd deep, turn'd in the wound,Again we back off—I see 
him settle again—the life is leaving him fast,As he rises, 
he spouts blood—I see him swim in circles narrower and 
narrower, swiftly cutting the water—I see him die,He gives one 
convulsive leap in the centre of the cir- cle, and 
then falls flat and still in the bloody foam.1025 O 
the old manhood of me, my joy!My children and grand-children—my 
white hair and beard,My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the 
long stretch of my life.26 O the ripen'd joy of 
womanhood!O perfect happiness at last!I am more than eighty years 
of age—my hair, too, is pure white—I am the most 
venerable mother; How clear is my mind! how all people 
draw nigh to me!What attractions are these, beyond any before? 
what bloom, more than the bloom of youth?What beauty is 
this that descends upon me, and rises out of me?27 
O the joy of my soul leaning poised on itself—re- 
ceiving identity through materials, and loving them—observing characters, and absorbing 
them; O my soul, vibrated back to me, from them—from 
facts, sight, hearing, touch, my phrenology, reason, articulation, comparison, memory, 
and the like; O the real life of my senses 
and flesh, transcending my senses and flesh; O my body, 
done with materials—my sight, done with my material eyes; O 
what is proved to me this day, beyond cavil, that 
it is not my material eyes which finally see,Nor my 
material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, procreates.1128 
O the farmer's joys!Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Io- wan's, Kansian's,
