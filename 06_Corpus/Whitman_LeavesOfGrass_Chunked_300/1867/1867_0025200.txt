me; No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or 
my anger; Fetching the rest of the herd around to 
enjoy them a while,Then all uniting to stand on a 
headland and worry me.174 The sentries desert every other part 
of me;They have left me helpless to a red marauder;They 
all come to the headland, to witness and assist against 
me.Now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not 
a shot fired on either side; Then resumed, the chaos 
louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of officers; 
While from some distant part of the field the wind

sharp-tooth'd touch!Did it make you ache so, leaving me?178 Parting, 
track't by arriving—perpetual payment of perpetual loan; Rich, showering rain, 
and recompense richer after- ward.179 Sprouts take and accumulate—stand by
