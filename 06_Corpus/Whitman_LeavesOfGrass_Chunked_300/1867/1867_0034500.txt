to landscapes of continents, and a plain public road.318 Not 
I—not any one else, can travel that road for you,You 
must travel it for yourself.319 It is not far—it is 
within reach;Perhaps you have been on it since you were 
born, and did not know; Perhaps it is every where 
on water and on land.320 Shoulder your duds, dear son, 
and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,Wonderful cities 
and free nations we shall fetch as we go.321 If 
you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff 
of your hand on my hip,And in due time you 
shall repay the same service to me; For after we 
start, we never lie by again.322 This day before dawn 
I ascended a hill, and look'd at the crowded heaven,And 
I said to my Spirit, When we become the enfolders 
of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything 
in them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then? And 
my Spirit said No, we but level that lift, to 
pass and continue beyond .323 You are also asking me 
questions, and I hear you;I answer that I cannot answer—you 
must find out for yourself.324 Sit a while, dear son;Here 
are biscuits to eat, and here is milk to drink;But 
as soon as you sleep, and renew yourself in sweet 
clothes, I kiss you with a good-bye kiss, and open 
the gate for your egress hence.325 Long enough have you 
dream'd contemptible dreams; Now I wash the gum from your 
eyes;You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light, 
and of every moment of your life.326 Long have you 
timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore; Now I 
will you to be a bold swimmer,To jump off in 
the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,
