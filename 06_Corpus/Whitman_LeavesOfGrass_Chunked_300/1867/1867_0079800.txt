are my miracles?2 Realism is mine—my miracles—Take freely,Take without end—I 
offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you, 
or your eyes reach.3 Why! who makes much of a 
miracle?As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles,Whether 
I walk the streets of Manhattan,Or dart my sight over

me, every hour of the light and dark is a 
miracle,Every inch of space is a miracle,Every square yard of 
the surface of the earth is spread with the same,Every 
cubic foot of the interior swarms with the same;Every spear 
of grass—the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and
