criminals, brother of slaves,Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,With sudra face 
and worn brow—black, but in the depths of my heart, 
proud as any; Lifted, now and always, against whoever, scorning, 
assumes to rule me; Morose, full of guile, full of 
reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,(Though it was thought I was 
baffled and dispell'd, and my wiles done—but that will never 
be;)Defiant, I, SATAN, still live—still utter words—in new lands duly 
appearing, (and old ones also;)Permanent here, from my side, warlike, 
equal with any, real as any,Nor time, nor change, shall 
ever change me or my words.4Santa SPIRITA, breather, life,Beyond the 
light, lighter than light,Beyond the flames of hell—joyous, leaping easily

me to sing the songs of the great Idea! take 
all the rest; I have loved the earth, sun, animals—I 
have despised riches,I have given alms to every one that 
ask'd, stood up for the stupid and crazy, devoted my 
income and labor to others,I have hated tyrants, argued not 
concerning God, had patience and indulgence toward the peo- ple, 
taken off my hat to nothing known or un- known,I 
have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the 
young, and with the mothers of families,I have read these 
leaves to myself in the open air—I have tried them 
by trees, stars, rivers,I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own
