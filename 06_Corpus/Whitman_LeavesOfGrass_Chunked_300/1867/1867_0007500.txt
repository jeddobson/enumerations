The States, as during life—each man and woman my neighbor,The 
Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as 
near to him and her,The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with 
me—and I yet with any of them; 19a THE CENTENARIAN'S 
STORY.VOLUNTEER OF 1861, (At Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting the Centenarian.)1 
Give me your hand, old Revolutionary;The hill-top is nigh—but a 
few steps, (make room, gentlemen;)Up the path you have follow'd

can walk, old man, though your eyes are almost done; 
Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them

you tremble, and clutch my hand so convul- sively?The troops 
are but drilling—they are yet surrounded with smiles; Around them 
at hand, the well drest friends and the women; While 
splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down; 19b AS

artilleryman;)For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, 
to unsettle them; I am more resolute because all have 
denied me, than I could ever have been had all 
accepted me; I heed not, and have never heeded, either
