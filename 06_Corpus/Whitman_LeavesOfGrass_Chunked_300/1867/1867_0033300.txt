you, priests;My faith is the greatest of faiths, and the 
least of faiths,Enclosing worship ancient and modern, and all between 
ancient and modern,Believing I shall come again upon the earth 
after five thousand years,Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the Gods, 
saluting the sun,Making a fetish of the first rock or 
stump, powwowing with sticks in the circle of obis,Helping the 
lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the 
idols,Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic proces- sion—rapt 
and austere in the woods, a gymno- sophist,Drinking mead from

know the sea of torment, despair and unbelief.284 How the 
flukes splash!How they contort, rapid as lightning, with spasms, and 
spouts of blood!285 Be at peace, bloody flukes of doubters 
and sullen mopers; I take my place among you as 
much as among any;The past is the push of you, 
me, all, precisely the same,And what is yet untried and 
afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.286 I 
do not know what is untried and afterward;But I know 
it will in its turn prove sufficient, and can- not
