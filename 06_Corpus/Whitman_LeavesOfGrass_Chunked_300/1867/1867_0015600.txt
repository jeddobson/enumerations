I sing the Equalities;I sing the endless finalés of things;I 
say Nature continues—Glory continues;I praise with electric voice;For I do 
not see one imperfection in the universe;And I do not 
see one cause or result lamentable at last in the 
universe.11 O setting sun! though the time has come,I still 
warble under you, unmitigated adoration. 31c TO A HISTORIAN. You 
who celebrate bygones!Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of 
the races—the life that has exhibited itself; Who have treated 
of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers and 
priests; I, habitué of the Alleghanies, treating man as he 
is in himself, in his own rights,Pressing the pulse of 
the life that has seldom ex- hibited itself, (the great

The armfuls are packt to the sagging mow.49 I am 
there—I help—I came stretcht atop of the load; I felt 
its soft jolts—one leg reclined on the other;I jump from 
the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,And roll head 
over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.1050 Alone, 
far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,Wandering, amazed at 
my own lightness and glee;In the late afternoon choosing a 
safe spot to pass the night,Kindling a fire and broiling 
the fresh kill'd game;Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves, with 
my dog and gun by my side.51 The Yankee clipper
