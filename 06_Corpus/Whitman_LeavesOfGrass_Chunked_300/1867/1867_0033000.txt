hides, and bring him forth; Ever love—ever the sobbing liquid 
of life;Ever the bandage under the chin—ever the tressels of 
death.275 Here and there, with dimes on the eyes walking;To 
feed the greed of the belly, the brains liberally spooning; 
Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never 
once going; Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff 
for payment receiving; A few idly owning, and they the 
wheat continually claiming.276 This is the city, and I am 
one of the citizens;Whatever interests the rest interests me—politics, markets, 
newspapers, schools,Benevolent societies, improvements, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, 
real estate, and personal estate.277 The little plentiful mannikins, skipping 
around in collars and tail'd coats,I am aware who they 
are—(they are actually not worms or fleas.)278 I acknowledge the 
duplicates of myself—the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me; 
What I do and say, the same waits for them;Every 
thought that flounders in me, the same flounders in them.279 
I know perfectly well my own egotism;I know my omnivorous 
lines, and cannot write any less;And would fetch you, whoever 
you are, flush with my- self.280 No words of routine 
are mine,But abruptly to question, to leap beyond, yet nearer 
bring: This printed and bound book—but the printer, and the 
printing-office boy?The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and 
solid in your arms?The black ship mail'd with iron, her 
mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain 
and engineers?In the houses, the dishes and fare and furniture—but 
the host and hostess, and the look out of their 
eyes?The sky up there—yet here, or next door, or across 
the way?The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?Sermons, creeds, 
theology—but the fathomless human brain,And what is reason? and what 
is love? and what is life?43281 I do not despise
