saunter'd pondering,On time, space, reality—on such as these, and abreast 
with them, prudence.2 After all, the last explanation remains to 
be made about prudence,Little and large alike drop quietly aside 
from the pru- dence that suits immortality.3 The Soul is 
of itself;All verges to it—all has reference to what ensues;All

all of the future,All the brave actions of war and 
peace,All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, 
young children, widows, the sick, and to shunned persons,All furtherance 
of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves,All self-denial that
