when I myself out-gallop them?Even, as I stand or sit, 
passing faster than you.33194 O swift wind! O space and 
time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd 
at; What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass;What 
I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,And again 
as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of 
the morning.6 Phantoms, welcome, divine and tender!Invisible to the rest,

me exhaustless—make me a fountain,That I exhale love from me 
wherever I go,For the sake of all dead soldiers. 60a

shining curving motions, and foam.195 My ties and ballasts leave 
me—I travel—I sail—my elbows rest in the sea-gaps; I skirt 
the sierras—my palms cover continents;I am afoot with my vision.196 
By the city's quadrangular houses—in log huts— camping with lumbermen; 
Along the ruts of the turnpike—along the dry gulch and 
rivulet bed; Weeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots 
and parsnips—crossing savannas—trailing in forests; Prospecting—gold-digging—girdling the trees of a 
new purchase; Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand—hauling my boat
