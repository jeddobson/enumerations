Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, 
the Saskatchawan, or the Osage, I with the spring waters 
laughing and skipping and running; Northward, on the sands, on 
some shallow bay of Pau- manok, I, with parties of 
snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and 
aquatic plants; Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the 
crow with its bill, for amuse- ment—And I triumphantly twittering; 
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to 
refresh themselves—the body of the flock feed—the sentinels outside move 
around with erect heads watching, and are from time to 
time reliev'd by other sentinels—And I feeding and taking turns 
with the rest; In Kanadian forests, the moose, large as 
an ox, cor- ner'd by hunters, rising desperately on his 
hind- feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the hoofs as 
sharp as knives—And I, plunging at the hunters, corner'd and 
desperate; In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store- houses, and 
the countless workmen working in the shops,And I too of 
the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in myself than the 
whole of the Manna- hatta in itself,Singing the song of 
These, my ever-united lands—my body no more inevitably united, part 
to part, and made one identity, any more than my 
lands are inevitably united, and made ONE IDENTITY; Nativities, climates, 
the grass of the great Pastoral Plains,Cities, labors, death, animals, 
products, good and evil —these me,These affording, in all their 
particulars, endless feuillage to me and to America, how can 
I do less than pass the clew of the union 
of them, to afford the like to you?Whoever you are! 
how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you 
also be eligible as I am?How can I but, as 
here, chanting, invite you for your- self to collect bouquets
