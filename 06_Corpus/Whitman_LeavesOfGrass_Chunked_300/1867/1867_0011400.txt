other generals in their proudest triumphs?28 It is well—a lesson 
like that, always comes good;I must copy the story, and 
send it eastward and west- ward; I must preserve that 
look, as it beam'd on you, rivers of Brooklyn.29 See! 
as the annual round returns, the phantoms return; It is

to attest my songs,(To the average earth, the wordless earth, 
witness of war and peace,)To the Alleghanian hills, and the 
tireless Mississippi,To the rocks I, calling, sing, and all the 
trees in the woods,To the plain of the poems of 
heroes, to the prairie spreading wide,To the far-off sea, and
