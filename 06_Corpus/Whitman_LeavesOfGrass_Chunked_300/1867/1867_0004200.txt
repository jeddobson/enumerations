that has been better told or done before?Have you not 
imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?Is 
it a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?Has it not 
dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians, literats, 
of enemies' lands?Does it not assume that what is notoriously 
gone is still here?Does it answer universal needs? Will it

to American persons, pro- gresses, cities? Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the 
planter, Yankee, Georgian, native, immi- grant, sailors, squatters, old States, 
new States?Does it encompass all The States, and the unexcep- 
tional rights of all the men and women of the 
earth? (the genital impulse of These States;)Does it see behind 
the apparent custodians, the real custodians, standing, menacing, silent—the mechanics, 
Manhattanese, western men, south- erners, significant alike in their apathy, 
and in the promptness of their love?1133 Know you! to

rising inclusive and more resplen- dent,The greatness of Love and 
Democracy—and the greatness of Religion.35 Melange mine own! the unseen 
and the seen;Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;Prophetic spirit of 
materials shifting and flickering around me; Living beings, identities, now 
doubtless near us, inthe air, that we know not of;Contact 
daily and hourly that will not release me;These selecting—these, in 
hints, demanded of me.36 Not he, with a daily kiss, 
onward from childhood kissing me,Has winded and twisted around me
