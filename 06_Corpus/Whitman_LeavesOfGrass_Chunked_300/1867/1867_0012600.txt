of my folks, or of myself, or ill- doing, or 
loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations; Battles, 
the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, 
the fitful events; These come to me days and nights, 
and go from me again,But they are not the Me

Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and the rest, are to be,Of what 
a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, 
and the rest; Of what the feuillage of America is 
the preparation for—and of what all the sights, North, South,
