men; I dance with the dancers, and drink with the 
drinkers;The echoes ring with our indecent calls;I take for my 
love some prostitute—I pick out some low person for my 
dearest friend,He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate—he shall be one 
condemn'd by others for deeds done; I will play a 
part no longer—Why should I exile my- self from my

maternity, the land of migrations, look afar,Look off the shores 
of my Western Sea—the circle almost circled; For, starting westward 
from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,From Asia—from the north—from 
the God, the sage, and the hero,From the south—from the 
flowery peninsulas, and the spice islands; Long having wander'd since—round 
the earth having wander'd,Now I face home again—very pleas'd and 
joyous;(But where is what I started for, so long ago?And 
why is it yet unfound?) AGES AND AGES, RETURNING AT
