the siege?Lo! I send to that place a commander, swift, 
brave, immortal; And with him horse and foot—and parks of 
artillery,And artillerymen, the deadliest that ever fired gun. 159 LEAVES

day;And the first object he look'd upon, that object he 
be- came; And that object became part of him for 
the day, or a certain part of the day, or
