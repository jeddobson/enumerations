sitting constrain'd and still—for learning inures not to me; Beauty, 
knowledge, fortune, inure not to me—yet there are two things 
inure to me; I have nourish'd the wounded, and sooth'd 
many a dying soldier; And at intervals I have strung 
together a few songs,Fit for war, and the life of 
the camp.The dead face of an old salt with long 
white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers; The flames, spite of 
all that can be done, flickering aloft and below; The 
husky voices of the two or three officer yet fit 
for duty; Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves— 
dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars, Cut of 
cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of

swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, 
tapering groan; These so—these irretrievable.37238 O Christ! This is mastering

watch; It is I let out in the morning, and 
barr'd at night.241 Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail, 
but I am handcuff'd to him and walk by his 
side; (I am less the jolly one there, and more 
the silent one, with sweat on my twitching lips.)242 Not 
a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up 
too, and am tried and sentenced.243 Not a cholera patient 
lies at the last gasp, but I also lie at
