the patches of briers and blackberries,From the memories of the 
bird that chanted to me,From your memories, sad brother—from the 
fitful risings and fallings I heard,From under that yellow half-moon, 
late-risen, and swollen as if with tears,From those beginning notes 
of sickness and love, there in the transparent mist,From the 
thousand responses of my heart, never to cease,From the myriad 
thence-arous'd words,From the word stronger and more delicious than any,From 
such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,As a flock, 
twittering, rising, or overhead passing,Borne hither—ere all eludes me, hurriedly,A 
man—yet by these tears a little boy again,Throwing myself on 
the sand, confronting the waves,I, chanter of pains and joys, 
uniter of here and hereafter,Taking all hints to use them—but 
swiftly leaping beyond them,A reminiscence sing.22 Once, Paumanok,When the snows 
had melted, and the Fifth-month grass was growing,Up this sea-shore, 
in some briers,Two guests from Alabama—two together,And their nest, and 
four light-green eggs, spotted with brown,And every day the he-bird, 
to and fro, near at hand,And every day the she-bird, 
crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,And every day 
I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,Cautiously 
peering, absorbing, translating.33 Shine! shine! shine! Pour down your warmth, 
great Sun! While we bask—we two together .4 Two together! 
Winds blow South, or winds blow North, Day come white, 
or night come black, Home, or rivers and mountains from 
home, Singing all time, minding no time, If we two 
but keep together .45 Till of a sudden,May-be kill'd, unknown 
to her mate,One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the 
nest,Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,Nor ever appear'd again.6 
And thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,And 
at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer 
weather,Over the hoarse surging of the sea,Or flitting from brier
