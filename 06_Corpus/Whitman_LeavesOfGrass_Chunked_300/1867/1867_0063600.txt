you; It is hinted by nearest, commonest; readiest—it is ever 
provoked by them.18 You may read in many languages, yet 
read nothing about it; You may read the President's Message, 
and read nothing about it there; Nothing in the reports 
from the State department or Treasury department, or in the 
daily papers or the weekly papers,Or in the census or 
revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of stock.419 The 
sun and stars that float in the open air;The apple-shaped 
earth, and we upon it—surely the drift of them is 
something grand!I do not know what it is, except that 
it is grand, and that it is happiness,And that the 
enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or 
bon-mot, or reconnoissance,And that it is not something which by

must be a failure for us,And not something which may 
yet be retracted in a certain contingency.20 The light and 
shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the greed

the wonders that fill each minute of time forever,What have 
you reckon'd them for, camerado?Have you reckon'd them for a 
trade, or farm-work? or for the profits of a store?Or 
to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentle- 
man's leisure, or a lady's leisure?21 Have you reckon'd the 
landscape took substance and form that it might be painted 
in a picture?Or men and women that they might be 
written of, and songs sung?Or the attraction of gravity, and 
the great laws and harmonious combinations, and the fluids of 
the air, as subjects for the savans?Or the brown land
