killing-clothes,The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog- hook, 
the scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul, 
and the plenteous winter-work of pork-packing,Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, 
maize, rice—the barrels and the half and quarter barrels, the 
loaded barges, the high piles on wharves and levees,The men, 
and the work of the men, on railroads, coasters, fish-boats, 
canals; The daily routine of your own or any man's 
life—the shop, yard, store, or factory; These shows all near 
you by day and night—work- men! whoever you are, your 
daily life!In that and them the heft of the heaviest—in 
them far more than you estimated, and far less also; 
In them realities for you and me—in them poems for 
you and me; In them, not yourself—you and your Soul 
enclose all things, regardless of estimation; In them the development 
good—in them, all themes and hints.33 I do not affirm 
what you see beyond is futile—I do not advise you 
to stop; I do not say leadings you thought great 
are not great;But I say that none lead to greater, 
than those lead to.734 Will you seek afar off? You 
surely come back at last,In things best known to you, 
finding the best, or as good as the best,In folks 
nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest, lovingest; Happiness, knowledge, 
not in another place, but this place—not for another hour, 
but this hour; Man in the first you see or 
touch—always in friend, brother, nighest neighbor—Woman in mother, lover, wife; 
The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or 
any where,You workwomen and workmen of these States having your 
own divine and strong life,And all else giving place to 
men and women like you. 248 DEBRIS. HE is wisest 
who has the most caution;He only wins who goes far
