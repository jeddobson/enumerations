decay in the muck!Toss to the moaning gibberish of the 
dry limbs.347 I ascend from the moon, I ascend from 
the night;I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sun- 
beams reflected; And debouch to the steady and central from 
the off- spring great or small.50348 There is that in 
me—I do not know what it is—but I know it
