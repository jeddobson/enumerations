shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.47327 I am the 
teacher of athletes;He that by me spreads a wider breast 
than my own, proves the width of my own; He 
most honors my style who learns under it to destroy 
the teacher.328 The boy I love, the same becomes a

The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.333 No 
shutter'd room or school can commune with me,But roughs and 
little children better than they.334 The young mechanic is closest
