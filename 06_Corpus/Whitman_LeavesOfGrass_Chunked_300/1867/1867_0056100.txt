murmur on! O murmurs—you yourselves make me continue to sing, 
I know not why .28 O past! O life! O 
songs of joy! In the air—in the woods—over fields; Loved! 
loved! loved! loved! loved! But my love no more, no 
more with me! We two together no more .829 The 
aria sinking;All else continuing—the stars shining,The winds blowing—the notes of 
the bird continuous echoing,With angry moans the fierce old mother 
incessantly moaning,On the sands of Paumanok's shore, gray and rustling;The 
yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, droop- ing, the face of

I escape, never more the reverbera- tions,Never more the cries 
of unsatisfied love be absent from me,Never again leave me 
to be the peaceful child I was before what there, 
in the night,By the sea, under the yellow and sagging 
moon,The messenger there aroused—the fire, the sweet hell within,The unknown
