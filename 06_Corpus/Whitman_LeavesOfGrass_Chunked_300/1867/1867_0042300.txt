prove victorious,Nor will my poems do good only—they will do 
just as much evil, perhaps more; For all is useless 
without that which you may guess at many times and 
not hit—that which I hinted at; Therefore release me, and 
depart on your way. THESE I, SINGING IN SPRING.THESE, I, 
singing in spring, collect for lovers,(For who but I should 
understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy?And who but 
I should be the poet of comrades?)Collecting, I traverse the 
garden, the world—but soon I pass the gates,Now along the 
pond-side—now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,Now by

gathers around me,Some walk by my side, and some behind, 
and some embrace my arms or neck,They, the spirits of

is near me; Here! lilac, with a branch of pine,Here 
out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off 
a live-oak in Florida, as it hung trailing down,Here, some 
pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,And here 
what I now draw from the water, wading in the 
pond-side,(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and 
returns again, never to separate from me,And this, O this 
shall henceforth be the token of com- rades—this Calamus-root shall,Interchange 
it, youths, with each other! Let none render it back!)And
