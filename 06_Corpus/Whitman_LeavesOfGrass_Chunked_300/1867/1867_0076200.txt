indeed suspicion of death.35 Do you suspect death? If I 
were to suspect death, I should die now,Do you think 
I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?1036 Pleasantly and 
well-suited I walk,Whither I walk I cannot define, but I 
know it is good,The whole universe indicates that it is 
good,The past and the present indicate that it is good.37 
How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is 
my Soul!How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon 
it!What is called good is perfect, and what is called 
bad is just as perfect,The vegetables and minerals are all 
perfect, and the imponderable fluids are perfect; Slowly and surely 
they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely 
they yet pass on.38 My Soul! if I realize you, 
I have satisfaction,Animals and vegetables! if I realize you, I 
have sat- isfaction,Laws of the earth and air! if I 
realize you, I have satisfaction.39 I cannot define my satisfaction, 
yet it is so,I cannot define my life, yet it 
is so.1140 It comes to me now!I swear I think 
now that everything without excep- tion has an eternal Soul!The 
trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the 
sea have! the animals!41 I swear I think there is 
nothing but immortality!That the exquisite scheme is for it, and 
the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is 
for it; And all preparation is for it! and identity 
is for it! and life and death are altogether for 
it! 306 THIS COMPOST!1 SOMETHING startles me where I thought 
I was safest; I withdraw from the still woods I 
loved;I will not go now on the pastures to walk;I 
will not strip the clothes from my body to meet 
my lover the sea; I will not touch my flesh
