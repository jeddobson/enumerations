advance; Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone; They 
treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and seal, gave 
up their arms, and march'd back prisoners of war.219 They 
were the glory of the race of rangers;Matchless with horse, 
rifle, song, supper, courtship, 69a WEAVE IN, WEAVE IN, MY 
HARDY LIFE.WEAVE in! weave in, my hardy life!Weave, weave a

despatch'd with bayonets, or batter'd with the blunts of muskets; 
A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till 
two more came to release him; The three were all 
torn, and cover'd with the boy's blood.222 At eleven o'clock
