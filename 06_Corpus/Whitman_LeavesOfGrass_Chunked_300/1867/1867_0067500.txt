be- queath'd cause, as for all lands,And I send these 
words to Paris with my love,And I guess some chansonniers 
there will understand them,For I guess there is latent music

what will yet be supplied. 3.OF persons arrived at high 
positions, ceremonies, wealth, scholarships, and the like; To me, all 
that those persons have arrived at, sinks away from them, 
except as it results to their Bodies and Souls,So that 
often to me they appear gaunt and naked;And often, to
