stern- ly confronting death?It was the brigade of the youngest 
men, two thousand strong, 21b DIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS.1 THE 
last sunbeamLightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,On the pavement here—and 
there beyond, it is looking, Down a new-made double grave.2 
Lo! the moon ascending!Up from the east, the silvery round 
moon;Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon; Immense and silent 
moon.3 I see a sad procession,And I hear the sound

marching armies—a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,Bards towering like hills—(no more 
these dots, these pigmies, these little piping straws, these gnats, 
that fill the hour, to pass for poets;)Bards with songs 
as from burning coals, or the light- ning's fork'd stripes!Ample 
Ohio's bards—bards for California! inland bards; Bards of pride! Bards 
tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping eagle's scream!You, by
