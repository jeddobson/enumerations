poems settles justice, reality, immor- tality,His insight and power encircle 
things and the human race,He is the glory and extract, 
thus far, of things, and of the human race.2 The 
singers do not beget—only the POET begets;The singers are welcom'd, 
understood, appear often enough—but rare has the day been, likewise
