embryo stature and muscle,The haughty defiance of the Year 1—war, 
peace, the formation of the Constitution,The separate States, the simple, 
elastic scheme, the immigrants,The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and 
always sure and impregnable,The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, 
hunters, trappers; Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, tem- perature, the 
gestation of new States,Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the mem- bers

they swiftly fill;Countless masses debouch upon them;They are now cover'd 
with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.7 See, projected, through
