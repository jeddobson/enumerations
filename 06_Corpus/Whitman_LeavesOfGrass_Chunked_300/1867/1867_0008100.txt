less than they!I will see if I am not as 
majestic as they!I will see if I am not as 
subtle and real as they!I will see if I am 
to be less generous than they!Yet upon the plains west 
of the spinal river—yet in my house of adobie,Yet returning 
eastward—yet in the Sea-Side State, or in Maryland,Yet Kanadian, cheerily 
braving the winter—the snow and ice welcome to me,Yet a 
true son either of Maine, or of the Granite State, 
or of the Narragansett Bay State, or of the Empire 
State; Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same—yet 
welcoming every new brother; Hereby applying these leaves to the 
new ones, from the hour they unite with the old 
ones; Coming among the new ones myself, to be their 
com- panion and equal—coming personally to you now; Enjoining you 
to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.1656 With me, with firm 
holding—yet haste, haste on.57 For your life, adhere tome;Of all 
the men of the earth, I only can unloose you 
and toughen you; I may have to be persuaded many 
times before I consent to give myself to you—but what 
of that?Must not Nature be persuaded many times?58 No dainty 
dolce affettuoso I;Bearded, sunburnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,To be 
wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of 
the universe; For such I afford whoever can persevere to 
win them.Green the midsummer verdure, and fresh blows the dal- 
lying breeze,O'er proud and peaceful cities, and arm of the 
sea be- tween.4 But drill and parade are over—they march 
back to quarters; Only hear that approval of hands! hear 
what a clap- ping!5 As wending, the crowds now part 
and disperse—but we, old man,Not for nothing have I brought 
you hither—we must remain; You to speak in your turn,
