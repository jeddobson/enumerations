a man or woman,And a summit and flower there is 
the feeling they have for each other,And they are to 
branch boundlessly out of that lesson, until it becomes omnific,And

by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)I mark'd at the foot 
of a tree the grave of a soldier;Mortally wounded he, 
and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I understand;)The
