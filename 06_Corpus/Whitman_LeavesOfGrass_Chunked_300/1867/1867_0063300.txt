you?Or the rich better off than you? or the educated 
wiser than you?11 Because you are greasy or pimpled, or 
that you was once drunk, or a thief,Or diseas'd, or 
rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now; Or from 
frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, and 
never saw your name in print,Do you give in that 
you are any less immortal?312 Souls of men and women! 
it is not you I call un- seen, unheard, untouchable 
and untouching; It is not you I go argue pro 
and con about, and to settle whether you are alive 
or no; I own publicly who you are, if nobody 
else owns.13 Grown, half-grown, and babe, of this country and 
every country, indoors and outdoors, one just as much as 
the other, I see,And all else behind or through them.14 
The wife—and she is not one jot less than the 
husband; The daughter—and she is just as good as the 
son;The mother—and she is every bit as much as the 
father.15 Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,Young 
fellows working on farms, and old fellows working on farms,Sailor-men, 
merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,All these I see—but nigher and farther the 
same I see; None shall escape me, and none shall 
wish to escape me.16 I bring what you much need, 
yet always have,Not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good;I 
send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, 
but offer the value itself.17 There is something that comes 
home to one now and perpetually; It is not what 
is printed, preach'd, discuss'd—it eludes discussion and print; It is 
not to be put in a book—it is not in 
this book;It is for you, whoever you are—it is no 
farther from you than your hearing and sight are from
