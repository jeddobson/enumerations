are for, (I do not know what I am for 
myself, nor what anything is for,)But I will search carefully 
for it even in being foil'd,In defeat, poverty, imprisonment—for they 
too are great.9 Did we think victory great?So it is—But 
now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, 
that defeat is great,And that death and dismay are great. 
195 TO GET BETIMES IN BOSTON TOWN.1 To get betimes 
in Boston town, I rose this morning early; Here's a 
good place at the corner—I must stand and see the 
show.2 Clear the way there, Jonathan!Way for the President's marshal! 
Way for the gov- ernment cannon!Way for the Federal foot 
and dragoons—and the appa- ritions copiously tumbling.3 I love to 
look on the stars and stripes—I hope the fifes will 
play Yankee Doodle.4 How bright shine the cutlasses of the 
foremost troops!Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston 
town.5 A fog follows—antiques of the same come limping,Some appear 
wooden-legged, and some appear ban- daged and bloodless.6 Why this 
is indeed a show! It has call'd the dead out 
of the earth!The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried 
to see!Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!Cock'd hats of 
mothy mould! crutches made of mist!Arms in slings! old men 
leaning on young men's shoulders!7 What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? 
What is all this chattering of bare gums?Does the ague 
convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for fire-locks, 
and level them?8 If you blind your eyes with tears, 
you will not see the President's marshal; If you groan 
such groans you might balk the govern- ment cannon.9 For 
shame, old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd arms, and let 
your white hair be; Here gape your great grand-sons—their wives 
gaze at them from the windows,See how well-dress'd—see how orderly
