logs,Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, 
levels his piece; The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the 
wharf or levee; As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, 
the overseer views them from his saddle; The bugle calls

man;Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's 
en- treaties; Make even the trestles to shake the dead,
