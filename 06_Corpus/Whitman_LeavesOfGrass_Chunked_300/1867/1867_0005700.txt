Soul or defiled my Body,I have claim'd nothing to myself 
which I have not carefully claim'd for others on the 
same terms,I have sped to the camps, and comrades found 
and accepted from every State,45 I will effuse egotism, and 
show it underlying all— and I will be the bard 
of personality; And I will show of male and female 
that either is but the equal of the other; And 
I will show that there is no imperfection in the 
present—and can be none in the future; And I will 
show that whatever happens to anybody, it may be turn'd 
to beautiful results—and I will show that nothing can happen 
more beautiful than death; And I will thread a thread 
through my poems that time and events are compact,And that 
all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each 
as profound as any.46 I will not make poems with 
reference to parts;But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, 
says, thoughts, with reference to ensemble: And I will not 
sing with reference to a day, but with reference to 
all days; And I will not make a poem, nor 
the least part of a poem, but has reference to 
the Soul; (Because, having look'd at the objects of the 
universe, I find there is no one, nor any particle 
of one, but has reference to the Soul.)1447 Was somebody 
asking to see the Soul?See! your own shape and countenance—persons, 
sub- stances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the rocks 
and sands. All hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them: 
How can the real body ever die, and be buried?49 
Of your real body, and any man's or woman's real 
body,Item for item, it will elude the hands of the 
corpse- cleaners, and pass to fitting spheres, 17a 1861.ARM'D year!
