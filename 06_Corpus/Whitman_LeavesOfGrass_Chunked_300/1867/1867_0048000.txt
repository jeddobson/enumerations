see the battle-fields of the earth—grass grows up- on them, 
and blossoms and corn; I see the tracks of ancient 
and modern expeditions.18 I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages 
of the unknown events, heroes, records of the earth.19 I 
see the places of the sagas;I see pine-trees and fir-trees
