its best light,The music falling in where it is wanted, 
and stopping where it is not wanted,The cheerful voice of 
the public road—the gay fresh sentiment of the road.10 O 
highway I travel! O public road! do you say to 
me, Do not leave me?Do you say, Venture not? If 
you leave me, you are lost?Do you say, I am 
already prepared—I am well-beaten and undenied—adhere to me?11 O public

of air;The east and the west are mine, and the 
north and the south are mine.15 I am larger than 
I thought;I did not know I held so much goodness.16 
All seems beautiful to me;I can repeat over to men

would do the same to you.17 I will recruit for 
myself and you as I go;I will scatter myself among 
men and women as I go;I will toss the new 
gladness and roughness among them; Whoever denies me, it shall 
not trouble me;Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be
