then be long and exhaust- ing,The whole past theory of 
your life, and all conformity to the lives around you, 
would have to be aban- doned; Therefore release me now, 
before troubling yourself any further—Let go your hand from my 
shoulders,Put me down, and depart on your way.4 Or else, 
by stealth, in some wood, for trial,Or back of a 
rock, in the open air,(For in any roof'd room of 
a house I emerge not—nor in company,And in libraries I 
lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)But 
just possibly with you on a high hill—first watch- ing 
lest any person, for miles around, ap- proach unawares,Or possibly 
with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of 
the sea, or some quiet island,Here to put your lips 
upon mine I permit you,With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss, or 
the new husband's kiss,For I am the new husband, and 
I am the comrade.5 Or, if you will, thrusting me 
beneath your clothing,Where I may feel the throbs of your 
heart, or rest upon your hip,Carry me when you go 
forth over land or sea;For thus, merely touching you, is 
enough—is best,And thus, touching you, would I silently sleep and 
be carried eternally.6 But these leaves conning, you con at 
peril,For these leaves, and me, you will not understand,They will 
elude you at first, and still more afterward —I will 
certainly elude you,Even while you should think you had unquestionably 
caught me, behold!Already you see I have escaped from you.7 
For it is not for what I have put into 
it that I have written this book,Nor is it by 
reading it you will acquire it,Nor do those know me 
best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,Nor will the 
candidates for my love, (unless at most a very few,)
