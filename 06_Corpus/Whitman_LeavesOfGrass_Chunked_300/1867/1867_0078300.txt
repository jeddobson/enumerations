with absolute faith—to sweep through the ceaseless rings, and never 
be quiet again. 315 LEAVES OF GRASS. 1.1 On the 
beach at night alone,As the old mother sways her to 
and fro, singing her savage and husky song,As I watch 
the bright stars shining—I think a thought of the clef

clarifyings, elevations, and removing obstructions; After these, and more, it 
is just possible there comes to a man, a woman, 
the divine power to use words.4 Then toward that man 
or that woman, swiftly hasten all—None refuse, all attend; Armies, 
ships, antiquities, the dead, libraries, paintings, machines, cities, hate, despair,
