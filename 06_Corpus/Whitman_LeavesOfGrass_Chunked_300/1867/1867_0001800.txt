generation playing its part, and passing on,Another generation playing its 
part, and passing on in its turn,With faces turn'd sideways 
or backward towards me, to listen,With eyes retrospective towards me.Factories, 
mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east, north-west, south-west,Manhattan firemen, the 
Yankee swap, southern plan- tation life,Slavery—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to 
raise it upon the ruins of all the rest; On 
and on to the grapple with it—Assassin! then your life

masses!For you a programme of chants.10 Chants of the prairies;Chants 
of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea; 
Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota; Chants 
going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence, equi-distant,Shooting 
in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.411 In the
