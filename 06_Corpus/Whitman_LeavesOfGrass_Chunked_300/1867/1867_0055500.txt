to brier by day,I saw, I heard at intervals, the 
remaining one, the he-bird,The solitary guest from Alabama.57 Blow! blow! 
blow! Blow up, sea-winds, along Paumanok's shore! I wait and 
I wait, till you blow my mate to me .68 
Yes, when the stars glisten'd,All night long, on the prong 
of a moss-scallop'd stake,Down, almost amid the slapping waves,Sat the 
lone singer, wonderful, causing tears.9 He call'd on his mate;He 
pour'd forth the meanings which I, of all men, know.10 
Yes, my brother, I know;The rest might not—but I have 
treasur'd every note; For once, and more than once, dimly, 
down to the beach gliding,Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself 
with the shadows,Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the 
sounds and sights after their sorts,The white arms out in 
the breakers tirelessly tossing,I, with bare feet, a child, the 
wind wafting my hair,Listen'd long and long.11 Listen'd, to keep, 
to sing—now translating the notes,Following you, my brother.712 Soothe! soothe! 
soothe! Close on its wave soothes the wave behind, And 
again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close , 
But my love soothes not me, not me .13 Low 
hangs the moon—it rose late; O it is lagging—O I 
think it is heavy with love, with love .14 O 
madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land . With 
love—with love .15 O night! do I not see my 
love fluttering out there among the breakers? What is that 
little black thing I see there in the white? 16 
Loud! loud! loud! Loud I call to you, my love! 
High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves; 
Surely you must know who is here, is here; You 
must know who I am, my love .17 Low-hanging moon! 
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow? O
