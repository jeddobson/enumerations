Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, 
Oshkosh, Walla- Walla; Leaving such to The States, they melt, 
they depart, charging the water and the land with names.1861 
O expanding and swift! O henceforth,Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, 
and audacious; A world primal again—Vistas of glory, incessant and 
branching; A new race, dominating previous ones, and grander far, 
with new contests,New politics, new literatures and religions, new in- 
ventions and arts.62 These! my voice announcing—I will sleep no 
more, but arise; You oceans that have been calm within 
me! how I feel you, fathomless, stirring, preparing un- precedented 
waves and storms.Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns 
are mounted; I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching 
from river to bay; I mark the vista of waters, 
I mark the uplands and slopes: Here we lay encamp'd—it

war ships had just arrived—the king had sent them from

A few days more, and they landed—and then the battle.11 
Twenty thousand were brought against us,A veteran force, furnish'd with 
good artillery.12 I tell not now the whole of the 
battle;But one brigade, early in the forenoon, order'd forward to 
engage the red-coats; Of that brigade I tell, and how 
steadily it march'd,And how long and how well it stood, 
confronting death.13 Who do you think that was, marching steadily,
