cautiously ahead— I hear the irregular snap! snap!I hear the 
sounds of the different missiles—the short t-h-t! t-h-t! of the 
rifle balls; I see the shells exploding, leaving small white 
clouds— I hear the great shells shrieking as they pass; 
The grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through 
the trees, (quick, tumultuous, now the contest rages!)All the scenes 
at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again; 
The crashing and smoking—the pride of the men in their 
pieces; The chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and

and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly 
different from myself; On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my 
limbs,Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,Behaving 
licentious toward me, taking no denial,Depriving me of my best, 
as for a purpose,Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the 
bare waist,Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight 
and pasture-fields,Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,They bribed to swap off 
with touch, and go and graze at the edges of
