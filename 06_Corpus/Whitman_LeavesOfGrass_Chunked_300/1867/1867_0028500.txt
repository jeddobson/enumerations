sea-islands; I chant my sail-ships and steam-ships threading the ar- 
chipelagoes; I chant my stars and stripes fluttering in the 
wind;I chant commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done 
its work—races, reborn, refresh'd; Lives, works, resumed—The object I know 
not—but the old, the Asiatic, resumed, as it must be,Commencing 
from this day, surrounded by the world.11 And you, Libertad 
of the world!You shall sit in the middle, well-pois'd, thousands 
of years; As to-day, from one side, the Princes of 
Asia come to you; As to-morrow, from the other side, 
the Queen of Eng- land sends her eldest son to 
you.12 The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,The ring 
is circled, the journey is done;The box-lid is but perceptibly 
open'd—nevertheless the perfume pours copiously out of the whole box.13 
Young Libertad!With the venerable Asia, the all-mother,Be considerate with her, 
now and ever, hot Libertad— for you are all; Nigh 
the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a 
candle: Voyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure;Hurrying with 
the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any; Hot 
toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife 
him; Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts 
gone from me a long while; Walking the old hills 
of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side; 
Speeding through space—speeding through heaven and the stars; Speeding amid 
the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter 
of eighty thousand miles; Speeding with tail'd meteors—throwing fire-balls like 
the rest; Carrying the crescent child that carries its own 
full mother in its belly; Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,Backing 
and filling, appearing and disappearing;I tread day and night such 
roads.197 I visit the orchards of spheres, and look at 
the product; And look at quintillions ripen'd, and look at
