every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the 
steps; All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and 
mount.298 Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me;Afar down 
I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was even

lethargic mist,And took my time, and took no hurt from

life,Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,Noiselessly passing handfuls out 
of their hearts, and giving them to be mine.307 Old 
age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!308 
Every condition promulges not only itself—it pro- mulges what grows
