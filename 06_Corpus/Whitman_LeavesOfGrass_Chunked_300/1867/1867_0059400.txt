are as real as before; But the Soul is also 
real,—it too is positive and direct; No reasoning, no proof 
has establish'd it,Undeniable proof has establish'd it.630 This is a 
poem for the sayers of words—these are hints of meanings,These 
are they that echo the tones of Souls, and the

swear I will never henceforth have to do with the 
faith that tells the best!I will have to do only 
with that faith that leaves the best untold.732 Say on, 
sayers!Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!Work on—it is 
materials you bring, not breaths;Work on, age after age! nothing 
is to be lost;It may have to wait long, but 
it will certainly come in use; When the materials are 
all prepared, the architects shall appear.33 I swear to you 
the architects shall appear without fail! I announce them and 
lead them; I swear to you they will understand you 
and justify you; I swear to you the greatest among 
them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses 
all, and is faithful to all; I swear to you, 
he and the rest shall not forget you— they shall 
perceive that you are not an iota less than they; 
I swear to you, you shall be glorified in them. 
222 LONGINGS FOR HOME.O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, perfumed South! My 
South!O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good and 
evil! O all dear to me!O dear to me my 
birth-things—All moving things, and the trees where I was born—the 
grains, plants, rivers; Dear to me my own slow sluggish 
rivers where they flow, distant, over flats of silvery sands,
