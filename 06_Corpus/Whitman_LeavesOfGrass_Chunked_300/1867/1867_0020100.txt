glittering tides!City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling

place;The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, 
are in their place; The palpable is in its place, 
and the impalpable is in its place.)1781 These are the 
thoughts of all men in all ages and lands—they are

If they are not the riddle and the untying of 
the rid- dle, they are nothing; If they are not
