and the blue sea for maps and charts?Or the stars 
to be put in constellations and named fancy names?Or that 
the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agriculture 
itself?22 Old institutions—these arts, libraries, legends, col- lections, and the 
practice handed along in man- ufactures—will we rate them so 
high?Will we rate our cash and business high ?—I have 
no objection; I rate them as high as the highest—then 
a child born of a woman and man I rate 
beyond all rate.23 We thought our Union grand, and our 
Constitution grand; I do not say they are not grand 
and good, for they are; I am this day just 
as much in love with them as you;Then I am 
in love with you, and with all my fellows upon 
the earth.24 We consider bibles and religions divine—I do not 
say they are not divine; I say they have all 
grown out of you, and may grow out of you 
still; It is not they who give the life—it is 
you who give the life; Leaves are not more shed 
from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they 
are shed out of you.525 When the psalm sings instead 
of the singer;When the script preaches, instead of the preacher;When 
the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that 
carved the supporting desk; When I can touch the body 
of books, by night or by day, and when they 
touch my body back again; When a university course convinces, 
like a slumber- ing woman and child convince; When the 
minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter; 
When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my 
friendly companions; I intend to reach them my hand, and 
make as much of them as I do of men
