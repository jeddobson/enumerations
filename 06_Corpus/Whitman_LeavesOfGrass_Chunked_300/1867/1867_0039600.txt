will of her, and holds himself tremulous and tight till 
he is satisfied,The wet of woods through the early hours,Two 
sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one 
with an arm slanting down across and below the waist 
of the other,The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage-plant, 
mint, birch-bark,The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he 
con- fides to me what he was dreaming,The dead leaf 
whirling its spiral whirl, and falling still and content to 
the ground,The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me 
with,The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as 
it ever can any one,The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that 
only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are,The curious 
roamer, the hand, roaming all over the body—the bashful withdrawing 
of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge them- 
selves,The limpid liquid within the young man,The vexed corrosion, so 
pensive and so painful,The torment—the irritable tide that will not 
be at rest,The like of the same I feel—the like 
of the same in others,The young man that flushes and 
flushes, and the young woman that flushes and flushes,The young 
man that wakes, deep at night, the hot hand seeking 
to repress what would master him; The mystic amorous night—the 
strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats,The pulse pounding through palms and 
trembling encircling fingers—the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry; 
The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as 
I lie willing and naked,The merriment of the twin-babes that 
crawl over the grass in the sun, the mother never 
turning her vigilant eyes from them,The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and 
the ripening or ripen'd long-round walnuts; The continence of vegetables, 
birds, animals,The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or 
find myself indecent, while birds and animals never once skulk
