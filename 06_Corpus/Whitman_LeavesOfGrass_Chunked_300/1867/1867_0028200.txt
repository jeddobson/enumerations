upon small crabs; Where the splash of swimmers and divers 
cools the warm noon; Where the katy-did works her chromatic 
reed on the walnut-tree over the well; Through patches of 
citrons and cucumbers with silver- wired leaves; Through the salt-lick

I chant the new empire, grander than any before—As in 
a vision it comes to me; I chant America, the 
Mistress—I chant a greater su- premacy; I chant, projected, a 
thousand blooming cities yet, in time, on those groups of
