reach'd till you held my feet.25 Swiftly arose and spread 
around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the 
argument of the earth; And I know that the hand 
of God is the promise of my own; And I 
know that the spirit of God is the brother of 
my own; And that all the men ever born are

And that a kelson of the creation is love;10 O 
resistless, restless race!O beloved race in all! O my breast

advancing on!Are there some of us to droop and die? 
has the hour come?Then upon the march we fittest die, 
soon and sure the gap is fill'd, Pioneers! O pioneers!Of 
immense spiritual results, future years, each side of the Anahuacs; 
Of these leaves, well understood there, (being made for that 
area;)Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there;(O it 
lurks in me night and day—What is gain, after all, 
to savageness and freedom?) 27c AS NEARING DEPARTURE.1 AS nearing 
departure,As the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,A dread beyond, 
of I know not what, darkens me.2 I shall go
