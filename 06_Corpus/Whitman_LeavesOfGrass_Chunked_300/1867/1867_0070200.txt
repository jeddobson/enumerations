blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with braced body,My left foot 
is on the gunwale—my right arm throws the coils of 
slender rope,In sight around me the quick veering and darting 
of fifty skiffs, my companions.720 O boating on the rivers!The 
voyage down the Niagara, (the St. Lawrence,)— the superb scenery—the

There she blows, Again I spring up the rigging, to 
look with the rest— We see—we descend, wild with excitement,I 
leap in the lower'd boat—We row toward our prey, where 
he lies,We approach, stealthy and silent—I see the moun- tainous 
mass, lethargic, basking,I see the harpooner standing up—I see the
