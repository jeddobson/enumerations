blood; Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again 
give me, many a year hence,In unseen essence and odor 
of surface and grass, centu- ries hence; In blowing airs 
from the fields, back again give me my darlings—give my 
immortal heroes; Exhale me them centuries hence—breathe me their breath—let

midnight;Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness; 
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking—preparations to pass to the 
one we have conquer'd; The captain on the quarter-deck coldly 
giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet; 
Near by, the corpse of the child that serv'd in 
the cabin; 72a NOT YOUTH PERTAINS TO ME.NOT youth pertains 
to me,Nor delicatesse—I cannot beguile the time with talk;Awkward in 
the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant;In the learn'd coterie
