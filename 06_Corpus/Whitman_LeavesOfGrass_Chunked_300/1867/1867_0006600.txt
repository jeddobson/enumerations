lands, did you wait for your poet?Did you wait for 
one with a flowing mouth and in- dicative hand?54 Toward 
the male of The States, and toward the female of 
The States,Live words—words to the lands.55 O the lands! interlink'd, 
food-yielding lands!Land of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands 
of cotton, sugar, rice!Land of wheat, beef, pork! Land of 
wool and hemp! Land of the apple and grape!Land of 
the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! Land of 
those sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!Land of the herd, the garden, the 
healthy house of adobie!Lands where the northwest Columbia winds, and 
where the southwest Colorado winds! 18a FROM PAUMANOK STARTING I

all;To the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,To 
Kanada, 'till I absorb Kanada in myself—to Michi- gan then,To

and Arkansas to sing theirs,To Tennessee and Kentucky—to the Carolinas 
and Georgia, to sing theirs,To Texas, and so along up 
toward California, to roam accepted everywhere; To sing first, (to 
the tap of the war-drum, if need be,)The idea of 
all—of the western world, one and insep- arable,And then the 
song of each member of These States. 18a BEGINNING MY 
STUDIES.BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so much,The 
mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the pow- er of motion,The least insect 
or animal—the senses—eyesight;The first step, I say, aw'd me and 
pleas'd me so much,I have never gone, and never wish'd 
to go, any farther,But stop and loiter all my life, 
to sing it in extatic songs. 18b O ME! O 
LIFE!O ME! O life!…of the questions of these recurring;Of the
