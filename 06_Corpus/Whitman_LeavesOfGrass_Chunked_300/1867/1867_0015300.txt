his star, quickly working his passage to the centre of 
the crowd; The impassive stones that receive and return so 
many echoes; What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall 
sun-struck, or in fits; What exclamations of women taken suddenly, 
who hurry home and give birth to babes; What living 
and buried speech is always vibrating here —what howls restrain'd 
by decorum, 31a THE DRESSER.1 An old man bending, I 
come, among new faces,Years looking backward, resuming, in answer to 
chil- dren, Come tell us old man, as from young 
men and maidens that love me; Years hence of these 
scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was 
one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)Now be 
witness again—paint the mightiest armies of earth; Of those armies 
so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?What 
stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,Of hard-fought 
engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest remains?2 O maidens and 
young men I love, and that love me,What you ask 
of my days, those the strangest and sud- den your 
talking recals; Soldier alert I arrive, after a long march, 
cover'd with sweat and dust; In the nick of time 
I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the 
rush of successful charge; Enter the captur'd works . . 
. . yet lo! like a swift- running river, they 
fade; Pass and are gone, they fade—I dwell not on 
soldiers' perils or soldiers' joys; (Both I remember well—many the 
hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)As I bathed 
on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on 
the beach of the Western Sea; As I roam'd the 
streets of inland Chicago—whatever streets I have roam'd; Wherever I 
have been, I have charged myself with contentment and triumph.10
