fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, and of men 
and women, and of all qualities and processes; It is 
greater than wealth—it is greater than buildings, ships, religions, paintings, 
music.13 Great is the English speech—what speech is so great 
as the English?Great is the English brood—what brood has so 
vast a destiny as the English ?It is the mother 
of the brood that must rule the earth with the 
new rule; The new rule shall rule as the Soul 
rules, and as the love, justice, equality in the Soul 
rule.14 Great is law—great are the old few land-marks of 
the law,They are the same in all times, and shall 
not be dis- turb'd.15 Great is Justice!Justice is not settled 
by legislators and laws—it is in the Soul; It cannot 
be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the 
attraction of gravity, can; It is immutable—it does not depend 
on majorities— majorities or what not, come at last before 
the same passionless and exact tribunal.16 For justice are the 
grand natural lawyers, and per- fect judges—is it in their 
Souls; It is well assorted—they have not studied for nothing 
—the great includes the less; They rule on the highest 
grounds—they oversee all eras, states, administrations.17 The perfect judge fears 
nothing—he could go front to front before God; Before the 
perfect judge all shall stand back—life and death shall stand 
back—heaven and hell shall stand back.18 Great is Life, real 
and mystical, wherever and who- ever; Great is Death—sure as 
life holds all parts together, Death holds all parts together.19 
Has Life much purport?—Ah, Death has the greatest purport. 294

spread in the sunshine before me.2 A young man came
