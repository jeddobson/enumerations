of the world, and of time and space, are upon 
me.34 You poor koboo whom the meanest of the rest 
look down upon, for all your glimmering language and spirituality!You 
low expiring aborigines of the hills of Utah, Oregon, California!You 
dwarf'd Kamtschatkan, Greenlander, Lapp!You Austral negro, naked, red, sooty, with

wing my way myself.39 Toward all,I raise high the perpendicular 
handâ€”I make the signal,To remain after me in sight forever,For 
all the haunts and homes of men. 158 WHAT PLACE
