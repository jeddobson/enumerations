every day! let me hold new ones by the hand 
every day!Give me such shows! give me the streets of 
Manhattan!Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching—give me the sound 
of the trumpets and drums!(The soldiers in companies or regiments—some, 
starting away, flush'd and reckless; Some, their time up, returning, 
with thinn'd ranks— young, yet very old, worn, marching, noticing 
nothing;)—Give me the shores and the wharves heavy-fringed with the 
black ships!O such for me! O an intense life! O 
full to repletion, and varied!The life of the theatre, bar-room, 
huge hotel, for me!The saloon of the steamer! the crowded 
excursion for me! the torch-light procession!The dense brigade, bound for 
the war, with high piled military wagons following; People, endless, 
streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants; Manhattan streets, with their 
powerful throbs, with the beating drums, as now; 128 It 
alone is without flaw—it rounds and completes all;That mystic, baffling 
wonder I love, alone completes all.129 I accept reality, and 
dare not question it;Materialism first and last imbuing.130 Hurrah for 
positive science! long live exact demon- stration!Fetch stonecrop, mixt with 
cedar and branches of lilac; This is the lexicographer—this the 
chemist—this made a grammar of the old cartouches; These mariners 
put the ship through dangerous un- known seas; This is 
the geologist—this works with the scalpel— and this is a 
mathematician.131 Gentlemen! to you the first honors always:Your facts are 
useful and real—and yet they are not my dwelling; (I 
but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.)132 
Less the reminders of properties told, my words;And more the 
reminders, they, of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,And 
make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men 
and women fully equipt,And beat the gong of revolt, and 
stop with fugitives, and them that plot and conspire.24133 Walt
