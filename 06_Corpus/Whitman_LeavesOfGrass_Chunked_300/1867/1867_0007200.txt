ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,Underneath all, to me 
is myself—to you, yourself, (the same monotonous old song.)1754 O 
I see now, flashing, that this America is only you 
and me,Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,Its crimes, 
lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,Its Congress is 
you and me—the officers, capitols, armies, ships, are you and 
me,Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,The 
war—that war so bloody and grim—the war I wish to

of sierras and peaks!Land of boatmen and sailors! Fishermen's land!Inextricable

land! the feminine! the ex- perienced sisters and the inexperienced 
sisters!Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the diverse! the 
compact!The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Caro- linian!O all and 
each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at 
any rate include you all with perfect love!I cannot be 
discharged from you! not from one, any sooner than another!O 
Death! O for all that, I am yet of you, 
unseen, this hour, with irrepressible love,Walking New England, a friend, 
a traveler,Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the 
summer ripples, on Paumanok's sands,Crossing the prairies—dwelling again in Chicago— 
dwelling in every town,Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,Listening to 
the orators and the oratresses in public halls,Of and through
