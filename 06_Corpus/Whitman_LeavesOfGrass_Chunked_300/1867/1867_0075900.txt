Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, 
and all through the Mississippi country, and all over the 
earth.29 The great masters and kosmos are well as they 
go —the heroes and good-doers are well,The known leaders and 
inventors, and the rich own- ers and pious and distinguish'd, 
may be well,But there is more account than that—there is

all these things came but to ashes of dung,If maggots 
and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betray'd!Then
