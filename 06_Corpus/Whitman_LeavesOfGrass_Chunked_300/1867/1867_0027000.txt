down the shallow river; Where the panther walks to and 
fro on a limb over- head—where the buck turns furiously 
at the hunter; Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length 
on a rock —where the otter is feeding on fish; 
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the 
bayou; Where the black bear is searching for roots or 
honey —where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped

its pavements; When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the 
proud roar I love; When the round-mouth'd guns, out of 
the smoke and smell I love, spit their salutes; When 
the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me— when heaven-clouds canopy 
my city with a delicate thin haze; When, gorgeous, the 
countless straight stems, the for- ests at the wharves, thicken 
with colors; When every ship, richly drest, carries her flag
