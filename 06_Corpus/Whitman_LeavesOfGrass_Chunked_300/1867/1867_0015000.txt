stars, dart on and on!How the water sports and sings! 
(Surely it is alive!)How the trees rise and stand up—with 
strong trunks —with branches and leaves!(Surely there is something more

hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs; The 
flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside, borne 
to the hospital; The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, 
the blows and fall; The excited crowd, the policeman with
