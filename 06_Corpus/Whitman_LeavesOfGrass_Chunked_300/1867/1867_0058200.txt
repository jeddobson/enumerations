words— those upright lines? those curves, angles, dots?No, those are 
not the words—the substantial words are in the ground and 
sea,They are in the air—they are in you.3 Were you 
thinking that those were the words— those delicious sounds out 
of your friends' mouths?No, the real words are more delicious 
than they.4 Human bodies are words, myriads of words;In the 
best poems re-appears the body, man's or wo- man's, well-shaped, 
natural, gay,Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the 
need of shame.5 Air, soil, water, fire—these are words;I myself 
am a word with them—my qualities inter- penetrate with theirs—my 
name is nothing to them; Though it were told in 
the three thousand languages, what would air, soil, water, fire,

go with the mere looks of some men and women,

by the inaudible words of the earth; The great masters 
know the earth's words, and use them more than the 
audible words.8 Amelioration is one of the earth's words;The earth 
neither lags nor hastens;It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent 
in itself from the jump; It is not half beautiful 
only—defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show.9 
The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;The truths 
of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal'd 
either; They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;They are imbued 
through all things, conveying them- selves willingly,Conveying a sentiment and 
invitation of the earth—I utter and utter,I speak not, yet 
if you hear me not, of what avail am I 
to you?To bear—to better—lacking these, of what avail am I?10
