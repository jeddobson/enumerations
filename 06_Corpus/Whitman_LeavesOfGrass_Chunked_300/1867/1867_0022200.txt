faces; 119 I am not the poet of goodness only—I 
do not de- cline to be the poet of wickedness 
also.120 Washes and razors for foofoos—for me freckles and a 
bristling beard.121 What blurt is this about virtue and about 
vice?Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me—I stand

soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)2Keep your splendid silent 
sun;Keep your woods, O Nature, and the quiet places by

your corn- fields and orchards; Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields, 
where the Ninth- month bees hum; Give me faces and 
streets! give me these phantoms in- cessant and endless along 
the trottoirs!Give me interminable eyes! give me women! give me 
comrades and lovers by the thousand!Let me see new ones
