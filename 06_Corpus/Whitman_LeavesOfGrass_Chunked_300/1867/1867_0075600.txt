to take interest shall be well.21 The sky continues beautiful,The 
pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor 
the pleasure of women with men, nor the pleasure from 
poems,The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building 
of houses—these are not phan- tasms—they have weight, form, location; 
Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them 
phantasms,The difference between sin and goodness is no de- lusion,The 
earth is not an echo—man and his life, and all

that were spun are gathered, the weft crosses the warp, 
the pattern is systematic.25 The preparations have everyone been justified,The 
orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instru- ments—the baton has given 
the signal.26 The guest that was coming—he waited long, for 
reasons—he is now housed,He is one of those who are 
beautiful and happy—he is one of those that to look 
upon and be with is enough.27 The law of the 
past cannot be eluded,The law of the present and future 
cannot be eluded,The law of the living cannot be eluded—it 
is eternal,The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,The 
law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,The law of 
drunkards, informers, mean persons—not one iota thereof can be eluded.828
