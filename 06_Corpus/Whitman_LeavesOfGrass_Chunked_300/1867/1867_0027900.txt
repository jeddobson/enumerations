crawling spread of the square miles far and near; Where 
the humming-bird shimmers—where the neck of the long-lived swan is 
curving and winding; Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, 
where she laughs her near-human laugh; Where bee-hives range on 
a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the 
high weeds; Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on 
the ground with their heads out; Where burial coaches enter 
the arch'd gates of a cemetery; Lithe and silent, the 
Hindoo appears—the whole Asiatic continent itself appears—the Past, the dead,The

castes, all,Trooping up, crowding from all directions—from the Altay mountains,From 
Thibet—from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of China,From the 
Southern peninsulas, and the demi-continental islands—from Malaysia; These, and whatever 
belongs to them, palpable, show forth to me, and are 
seiz'd by me,And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily 
held by them,Till, as here, them all I chant, Libertad! 
for themselves and for you.Where winter wolves bark amid wastes 
of snow and icicled trees; Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes
