Whitman am I, of mighty Manhattan the son,Turbulent, fleshy and 
sensual, eating, drinking and breeding; No sentimentalist—no stander above men

interminable generations of slaves;Voices of prostitutes, and of deform'd persons;Voices 
of the diseas'd and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs; 
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,And of the threads 
that connect the stars—and of wombs, and of the fatherstuff,And
