on bays, lagoons, creeks or along the coast!O to continue 
and be employ'd there all my life!O the briny and 
damp smell—the shore—the salt weeds exposed at low water,The work 
of fishermen—the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher.16 O it

near the surface, they seem to fill the water for 
miles; Or, another time, fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake Bay—I 
one of the brown-faced crew; Or, another time, trailing for
