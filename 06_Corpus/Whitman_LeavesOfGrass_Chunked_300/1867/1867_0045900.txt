of Pennsylvania,To the Kanadian of the North—to the Southerner I 
love; These, with perfect trust, to depict you as myself—the

with one I love, I fill myself with rage, for 
fear I effuse unreturn'd love; But now I think there 
is no unreturn'd love—the pay is certain, one way or 
another; (I loved a certain person ardently, and my love 
was not return'd; Yet out of that, I have written 
these songs.) THAT SHADOW, MY LIKENESS.THAT shadow, my likeness, that
