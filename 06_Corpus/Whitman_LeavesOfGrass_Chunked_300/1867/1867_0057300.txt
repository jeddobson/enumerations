the windows do not disturb me;Tall and sufficient stand behind, 
and make signs to me; I read the promise, and 
patiently wait.22 This is a full-grown lily's face,She speaks to 
the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets, Come here, she 
blushingly cries— Come nigh to me, lim- ber-hipp'd man, Stand 
at my side till I lean as high as I 
can upon you, Fill me with albescent honey, bend down 
to me, Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub 
to my breast and shoulders .523 The old face of 
the mother of many children!Whist! I am fully content.24 Lull'd 
and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,It hangs 
low over the rows of trees by the fences,It hangs 
thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry, and the cat-brier under 
them.25 I saw the rich ladies in full dress at 
the soiree,I heard what the singers were singing so long,Heard 
who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and 
the water-blue.26 Behold a woman!She looks out from her quaker 
cap—her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.27 
She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of 
the farm-house,The sun just shines on her old white head.28 
Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,Her grandsons raised the 
flax, and her grand-daugh- ters spun it with the distaff 
and the wheel.29 The melodious character of the earth,The finish 
beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not wish to 
go,The justified mother of men. 211 STRONGER LESSONS.HAVE you learned

the great lessons of those who rejected you, and braced 
themselves against you? or who treated you with contempt, or 
disputed the passage with you? 212 EUROPE, The 72d and
