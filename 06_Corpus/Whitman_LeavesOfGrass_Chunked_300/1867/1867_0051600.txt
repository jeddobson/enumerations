WITH antecedents;With my fathers and mothers, and the accumulations of 
past ages; With all which, had it not been, I 
would not now be here, as I am: With Egypt, 
India, Phenicia, Greece and Rome;With the Kelt, the Scandinavian, the 
Alb, and the Saxon; With antique maritime ventures,—with laws, artizan-

Have I forgotten any part?Come to me, whoever and whatever, 
till I give you recognition.5 I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, 
and the He- brews; I adopt each theory, myth, god, 
and demi-god;I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are
