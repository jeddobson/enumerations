And the good or bad I say of myself, I 
say of them.100 And I know I am solid and 
sound;To me the converging objects of the universe perpetu- ally 
flow; All are written to me, and I must get 
what the writing means.101 I know I am deathless;I know 
this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the car- 
penter's compass; I know I shall not pass like a 
child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.102 I

vindicate itself or be understood; I see that the elementary 
laws never apologize;(I reckon I behave no prouder than the

whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten 
thousand or ten million years,I can cheerfully take it now,

even and peaceful, you learn'd from joys and prosperity only; 
But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish—ad-

to conceive, and show to the world, what your children 
en-masse really are; (For who except myself has yet conceived 
what your children en-masse really are?)21106 I am the poet 
of the Body;And I am the poet of the Soul.107 
The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains
