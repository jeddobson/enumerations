endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill'd with the foolish; 
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more fool- ish 
than I, and who more faithless?)Of eyes that vainly crave 
the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew'd; Of 
the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds

my own modes of expressing love for men and women.52 
I swear I will have each quality of my race 
in myself,(Talk as you like, he only suits These States 
whose manners favor the audacity and sublime turbu- lence of 
The States.)53 Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,
