of music—the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges, broad 
at the back- top; The faces of hunters and fishers, 
bulged at the brows— the shaved blanch'd faces of orthodox 
citizens; The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face; The ugly 
face of some beautiful Soul, the handsome detested or despised 
face; The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of 
the mother of many children; The face of an amour, 
the face of veneration;The face as of a dream, the

they go.7 This is a face of bitter herbs—this an 
emetic—they need no label; And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, 
caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.8 This face is an epilepsy, its wordless 
tongue gives out the unearthly cry,Its veins down the neck 
distend, its eyes roll till they show nothing but their 
whites,Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut 
by the turn'd-in nails,The man falls struggling and foaming to 
the ground while he speculates well.9 This face is bitten
