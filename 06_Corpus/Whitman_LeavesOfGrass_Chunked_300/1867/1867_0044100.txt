love —but he was not in that place; And I 
dream'd I wander'd, searching among burial- places, to find him; 
And I found that every place was a burial-place;The houses 
full of life were equally full of death, (this house 
is now;)The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the 
Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, the Manna- hatta, were as full of 
the dead as of the living,And fuller, O vastly fuller, 
of the dead than of the living; —And what I 
dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,And 
I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd;And now I 
am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with them; And 
if the memorials of the dead were put up indif- 
ferently everywhere, even in the room where I eat or 
sleep, I should be satisfied; And if the corpse of 
any one I love, or if my own corpse, be 
duly render'd to powder, and pour'd in the sea, I 
shall be satisfied; Or if it be distributed to the 
winds, I shall be sat- isfied. CITY OF ORGIES.CITY of

me; Not the interminable rows of your houses—nor the ships 
at the wharves,Nor the processions in the streets, nor the 
bright win- dows, with goods in them; Nor to converse 
with learn'd persons, or bear my share in the soiree 
or feast; Not those—but, as I pass, O Manhattan! your 
fre- quent and swift flash of eyes offering me love,Offering 
response to my own—these repay me;Lovers, continual lovers, only repay 
me. BEHOLD THIS SWARTHY FACE.BEHOLD this swarthy face, this unrefined 
face—these gray eyes,This beard—the white wool, unclipt upon my neck,My
