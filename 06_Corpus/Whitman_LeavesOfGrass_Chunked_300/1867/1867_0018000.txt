is not something else; And the jay in the woods 
never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me; 
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out 
of me.1472 The wild gander leads his flock through the 
cool night; Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to 
me like an invitation; (The pert may suppose it meaningless, 
but I listen close; I find its purpose and place 
up there toward the wintry sky.)73 The sharp hoof'd moose 
of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, 
the prairie-dog,16 O how your fingers drowse me!Your breath falls 
around me like dew—your pulse lulls the tympans of my 
ears,I feel immerged from head to foot,Delicious—enough.17 Enough, O deed 
impromptu and secret!Enough, O gliding present! Enough, O summ'd-up past!518 
Dear friend, whoever you are, here, take this kiss,I give 
it especially to you—Do not forget me,I feel like one 
who has done his work—I progress on, —(long enough have 
I dallied with Life,)The unknown sphere, more real than I 
dream'd, more direct, darts awakening rays about me— So long! 
Remember my words—I love you—I depart from materials,I am as 
one disembodied, triumphant, dead.The litter of the grunting sow as 
they tug at her teats,The brood of the turkey spread 
wings; I see in them and myself the same old 
law.74 The press of my foot to the earth springs 
a hundred affections; They scorn the best I can do 
to relate them.75 I am enamour'd of growing outdoors,Of men 
that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or 
woods,Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders 
of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses; I 
can eat and sleep with them week in and week 
out.76 What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me; Me
