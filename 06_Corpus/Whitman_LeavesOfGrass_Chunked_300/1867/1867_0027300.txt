at the peak; When pennants trail, and street-festoons hang from 
the windows; Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, hold- ing 
on by low scragged limbs; Walking the path worn in 
the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush; 
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the 
wheat-lot; Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve—where the 
great gold-bug drops through the dark; Where the flails keep 
time on the barn floor;Where the brook puts out of 
the roots of the old tree and flows to the 
meadow; Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the 
tremulous shuddering of their hides; Where the cheese-cloth hangs in 
the kitchen—where andirons straddle the hearth webs fall in festoons 
from the rafters; Where trip-hammers crash—where the press is whirl- 
ing its cylinders; Wherever the human heart beats with terrible 
throes out of its ribs; Where the pear-shaped balloon is 
floating aloft, float- ing in it myself, and looking composedly 
down; Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose—where the 
heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand; Where the 
she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it; Where 
the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke; Where 
the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip 
out of the water; Where the half-burn'd brig is riding 
on unknown cur- rents,Where shells grow to her slimy deck—where 
the dead are corrupting below; Where the dense-starr'd flag is 
borne at the head of the regiments; Approaching Manhattan, up 
by the long-stretching island; When Broadway is entirely given up 
to foot-passengers and foot-standers—when the mass is densest; When the 
facades of the houses are alive with people— when eyes 
gaze, riveted, tens of thousands at a time; When the 
guests from the islands advance—when the pageant moves forward, visible;
