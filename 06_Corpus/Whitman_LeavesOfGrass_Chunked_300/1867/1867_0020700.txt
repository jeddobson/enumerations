is good to fall—battles are lost in the same spirit 
in which they are won.85 I beat and pound for 
the dead;I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gay- 
est for them.86 Vivas to those who have fail'd!And to 
those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!And to those themselves 
who sank in the sea!And to all generals that lost 
engagements! and all overcome heroes!And the numberless unknown heroes, equal 
to the greatest heroes known.1987 This is the meal pleasantly 
set—this is the meat for natural hunger; It is for 
the wicked just the same as the righteous—I make appointments 
with all; I will not have a single person slighted 
or left away;The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited;The heavy-lipp'd 
slave is invited—the venerealee is invited: There shall be no 
difference between them and the rest.88 This is the press 
of a bashful hand—this is the float and odor of 
hair; This is the touch of my lips to yours—this 
is the mur- mur of yearning; This is the far-off 
depth and height reflecting my own face; This is the 
thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet < again.89 Do 
you guess I have some intricate purpose?Well, I have—for the 
Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of 
a rock has.I faithfully loved you and cared for you 
living—I think we shall surely meet again;)Till at latest lingering 
of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,My comrade 
I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,Folded the 
blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and carefully under 
feet; And there and then, and bathed by the rising 
sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave 
I de- posited; Ending my vigil strange with that—vigil of 
night and battle-field dim; Vigil for boy of responding kisses,
