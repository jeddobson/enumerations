man, can come the poems of man—(only thence have my 
poems come;)Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I 
love, only thence can appear the strong and arrogant man 
I love; Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman 
I love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the 
man; Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain, 
come all the folds of the man's brain, duly obedient; 
Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice 
is unfolded; Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman 
is all sympathy: A man is a great thing upon 
the earth, and through eternity—but every jot of the greatness 
of man is unfolded out of woman,First the man is 
shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in 
himself. 3.1 NIGHT on the prairies;The supper is over—the fire 
on the ground burns low; The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt 
in their blankets;I walk by myself—I stand and look at 
the stars, which I think now I never realized before.2 
Now I absorb immortality and peace,I admire death, and test 
propositions.3 How plenteous! How spiritual! How resumé!The same Old Man 
and Soul—the same old aspira- tions, and the same content.4 
I was thinking the day most splendid, till I saw 
what the not-day exhibited,I was thinking this globe enough, till 
there sprang out so noiseless around me myriads of other 
globes.5 Now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity 
fill me, I will measure myself by them; And now, 
touch'd with the lives of other globes, ar- rived as 
far along as those of the earth,Or waiting to arrive, 
or pass'd on farther than those of the earth,I henceforth 
no more ignore them, than I ignore my own life,Or 
the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine,
