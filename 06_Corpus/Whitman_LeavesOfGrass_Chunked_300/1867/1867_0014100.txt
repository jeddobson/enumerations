to be from the white heads of old mothers; Darker 
than the colorless beards of old men;Dark to come from 
under the faint red roofs of mouths.34 O I perceive 
after all so many uttering tongues!And I perceive they do 
not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.35 I 
wish I could translate the hints about the dead young 
men and women,And the hints about old men and mothers, 
and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.36 What 
do you think has become of the young and old 
men?And what do you think has become of the women 
and children?37 They are alive and well somewhere;The smallest sprout 
shows there is really no death;And if ever there was, 
it led forward life, and does not wait at the 
end to arrest it,And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.38 All 
goes onward and outward—nothing collapses;And to die is different from 
what any one supposed, and luckier.20 These are of us, 
they are with us,All for primal needed work, while the 
followers there in embryo wait behind,We to-day's procession heading, we 
the route for travel clearing, Pioneers! O pioneers!21 O you 
daughters of the west!O you young and elder daughters! O 
you mothers and you wives!Never must you be divided, in 
our ranks you move united, Pioneers! O pioneers!22 Minstrels latent 
on the prairies!(Shrouded bards of other lands! you may sleep—you 
have done your work;)Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon 
you rise and tramp amid us, Pioneers! O pioneers!23 Not 
for delectations sweet;Not the cushion and the slipper, not the 
peaceful and the studious; Not the riches safe and palling, 
not for us the tame en- joyment, Pioneers! O pioneers!24 
Do the feasters gluttonous feast?Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have 
they lock'd and bolted doors?Still be ours the diet hard,
