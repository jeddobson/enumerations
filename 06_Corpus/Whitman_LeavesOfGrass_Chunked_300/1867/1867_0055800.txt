it is the shape, the shape of my mate! O 
moon, do not keep her from me any longer .18 
Land! land! O land! Whichever way I turn, O I 
think you could give me my mate back again, if 
you only would; For I am almost sure I see 
her dimly whichever way I look .19 O rising stars! 
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will 
rise with some of you .20 O throat! O trembling 
throat! Sound clearer through the atmosphere! Pierce the woods, the 
earth; Somewhere listening to catch you, must be the one 
I want .21 Shake out, carols! Solitary here—the night's carols! 
Carols of lonesome love! Death's carols! Carols under that lagging, 
yellow, waning moon! O, under that moon, where she droops 
almost down into the sea! O reckless, despairing carols .22 
But soft! sink low; Soft! let me just murmur; And 
do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea; For somewhere 
I believe I heard my mate responding to me, So 
faint—I must be still, be still to listen; But not 
altogether still, for then she might not come immediately tome 
.23 Hither, my love! Here I am! Here! With this 
just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you; This gentle call 
is for you, my love, for you .24 Do not 
be decoy'd elsewhere! That is the whistle of the wind—it 
is not my voice; That is the fluttering, the fluttering 
of the spray; Those are the shadows of leaves .25 
O darkness! O in vain! O I am very sick 
and sorrowful .26 O brown halo in the sky, near 
the moon, drooping upon the sea! O troubled reflection in 
the sea! O throat! O throbbing heart! O all—and I 
singing uselessly, uselessly all the night .27 Yet I murmur,
