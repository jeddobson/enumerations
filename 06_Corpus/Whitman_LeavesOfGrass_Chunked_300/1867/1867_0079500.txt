underfoot;What is yours is mine, my father.10 I too Paumanok,I 
too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been 
wash'd on your shores; I too am but a trail 
of drift and debris,I too leave little wrecks upon you, 
you fish-shaped island.11 I throw myself upon your breast, my 
father,I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,I 
hold you so firm, till you answer me something.12 Kiss

hither from many moods, one contradicting another,From the storm, the 
long calm, the darkness, the swell; Musing, pondering, a breath, 
a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil; Up 
just as much out of fathomless workings fer- mented and 
thrown; A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much 
over waves floating, drifted at random; Just as much for 
us that sobbing dirge of Nature;Just as much, whence we 
come, that blare of the cloud-trumpets; We, capricious, brought hither, 
we know not whence, spread out before you,You, up there, 
walking or sitting,Whoever you are—we too lie in drifts at 
your feet. 335 MIRACLES.1 WHAT shall I give? and which
