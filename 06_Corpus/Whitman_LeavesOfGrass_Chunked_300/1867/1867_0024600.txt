breathed froze me; A thick gloom fell through the sunshine 
and darken'd me; Must I change my triumphant songs? said 
I to myself;Must I indeed learn to chant the cold 
dirges of the baf- fled?And sullen hymns of defeat?166 I 
hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint;)I hear 
the key'd cornet—it glides quickly in through my ears; It

develop't, the quahaug in its cal- lous shell were enough.171 
Mine is no callous shell;I have instant conductors all over 
me, whether I pass or stop; 55a THE VETERAN'S VISION.WHILE 
my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars 
are over long,And my head on the pillow rests at 
home, and the mys- tic midnight passes,And through the stillness, 
through the dark, I hear, just hear, the breath of 
my infant,There in the room, as I wake from sleep, 
this vision presses upon me: The engagement opens there and 
then, in my busy brain unreal; The skirmishers begin—they crawl
