with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it,That all 
is clean forever and forever,That the cool drink from the 
well tastes so good,That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,That 
the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-orchard—that melons, 
grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,That when 
I recline on the grass I do not catch any 
disease,Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what 
was once a catching disease.6 Now I am terrified at 
the earth! it is that calm and patient,It grows such 
sweet things out of such corruptions,It turns harmless and stainless 
on its axis, with such endless successions of diseas'd corpses,It 
distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,It renews 
with such unwitting looks, its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,It gives 
such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from 
them at last. 308 I HEAR AMERICA SINGING.I HEAR America 
singing, the varied carols I hear;Those of mechanics—each one singing 
his, as it should be, blithe and strong; The carpenter 
singing his, as he measures his plank or beam,The mason 
singing his, as he makes ready for work, or leaves 
off work; The boatman singing what belongs to him in 
his boat —the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck; The 
shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench—the hatter singing 
as he stands; The wood-cutter's song—the ploughboy's, on his way 
in the morning, or at the noon intermission, or at 
sundown; The delicious singing of the mother—or of the young 
wife at work—or of the girl sewing or washing —Each 
singing what belongs to her, and to none else; The 
day what belongs to the day—At night, the party of 
young fellows, robust, friendly,Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious 
songs. 309 Manhattan's Streets I Saunter'd, Pondering.1 MANHATTAN'S streets I
