forth,I shall traverse The States—but I cannot tell whither or 
how long; Perhaps soon, some day or night while I 
am singing, my voice will suddenly cease.3 O book and 
chant! must all then amount to but this?Must we barely 
arrive at this beginning of me?… And yet it is 
enough, O soul!O soul! we have positively appear'd—that is enough.And 
limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields;And brown 
ants in the little wells beneath them;And mossy scabs of

same.31 And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut 
hair of graves.32 Tenderly will I use you,curling grass;It may 
be you transpire from the breasts of young men; It 
may be if I had known them I would have 
loved them.15 All the pulses of the world,Falling in, they 
beat for us, with the western movement beat; Holding single 
or together, steady moving, to the front, all for us, 
Pioneers! O pioneers!16 Life's involv'd and varied pageants,All the forms
