of hell are with me; The first I graft and 
increase upon myself—the latter I translate into a new tongue.108 
I am the poet of the woman the same as 
the man;And I say it is as great to be 
a woman as to be a man;And I say there 
is nothing greater than the mother of men.109 I chant 
the chant of dilation or pride;We have had ducking and 
deprecating about enough;I show that size is only development.110 Have 
you outstript the rest? Are you the Presi- dent?It is 
a trifle—they will more than arrive there, every one, and 
still pass on.111 I am he that walks with the 
tender and growing night; I call to the earth and 
sea, half-held by the night.112 Press close, bare-bosom'd night! Press 
close, mag- netic, nourishing night!Night of south winds! night of 
the large few stars!Still, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night.113 
Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breath'd earth!Earth of the slumbering and liquid 
trees;Earth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains, misty-topt!Earth of 
the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with 
blue! 46a A FARM PICTURE.THROUGH the ample open door of 
the peaceful country barn,A sun-lit pasture field, with cattle and 
horses feeding.Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of 
the river!Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and 
clearer for my sake!Far-swooping elbow'd earth! rich, apple-blossom'd earth!Smile, for 
your lover comes!114 Prodigal, you have given me love! Therefore 
I to you give love!O unspeakable, passionate love!22115 You sea! 
I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean; 
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers;I believe 
you refuse to go back without feeling of me;We must 
have a turn together—I undress—hurry me out of sight of 
the land; Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse;116
