blood, form'd from this soil, this air,Born here of parents 
born here, from parents the same, and their parents the 
same,I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health, begin,Hoping to 
cease not till death.12 Creeds and schools in abeyance,(Retiring back 
a while, sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,)I 
harbor, for good or bad—I permit to speak, at every 
hazard,Nature now without check, with original energy.513 Take my leaves, 
America! take them South, and take them North!Make welcome for 
them everywhere, for they are your own offspring; Surround them, 
East and West! for they would sur- round you; And 
you precedents! connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly 
with you.O America, because you build for mankind, I build 
for you!O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with 
decision and science,I lead the present with friendly hand toward 
the future.26 Bravas to all semitic impulses sending strong child- 
ren to the next age!But damn that which spends itself 
on flaunters and dalliers, with no thought of the stain, 
pains, dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing.927 I heard the voice 
arising, demanding bards;By them, all native and grand—by them only 
can The States be fused into the compact organism of 
a nation.28 To hold men together by paper and seal, 
or by com- pulsion, is no account,That only holds men 
together which aggregates all in a living principle,, as the 
hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres 
of plants.29 Of all races and eras, These States, with 
veins full of poetical stuff, most need poets, and are 
to have the greatest, and use them the greatest; Their 
Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as 
their poets shall.30 (Soul of love, and tongue of fire!Eye 
to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!—Ah, mother!
