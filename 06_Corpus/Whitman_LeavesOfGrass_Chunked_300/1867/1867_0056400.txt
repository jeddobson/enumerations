want, the destiny of me.32 O give me the clew! 
(it lurks in the night here somewhere;)O if I am 
to have so much, let me have more!O a word! 
O what is my destination? (I fear it is henceforth 
chaos;)O how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes, and all shapes, 
spring as from graves around me!O phantoms! you cover all 
the land and all the sea!O I cannot see in 
the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me; O 
vapor, a look, a word! O well-beloved!O you dear women's

do not forget,But fuse the song of my dusky demon 
and brother,That he sang to me in the moonlight on 
Paumanok's gray beach,With the thousand responsive songs, at random,My own 
songs, awaked from that hour;And with them the key, the 
word up from the waves,The word of the sweetest song, 
and all songs,That strong and delicious word which, creeping to 
my feet,The sea whisper'd me. 207 A LEAF OF FACES.11 
SAUNTERING the pavement, or riding the country by- road—lo! such 
faces!Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality; The spiritual prescient 
face—the always welcome, common, benevolent face,The face of the singing
