1 They rule out of our justice and our despair 
2 The strength of our strength. The meanings turn, resolve 
3 Into the play of our night, our flowering. 4 
Not that the day of truth is given the lie, 
5 But cut down long before. And with ourselves cut 
down. 6 Domination of smoke. The portraits are official, 7 
Say Lie, say Complexity is weakness. 8 We want our 
many-rooted heart. Flesh of our penetration 9 Allowing the empire 
of noon and midnight. 10 The rich, black-fielded life of 
the center, forests 11 Of corn and desires. These fields 
go deep 12 While madness and silence stifle the grass. 
13 A woman is running down the moonlight highway 14 
Of buried Indiana, underground. 15 Whatever slave : factory or 
teaching woman 16 She joins our buried life, the floods 
of secrecy 17 Told at the riverbank Don't flow, don't 
flow. 18 They are passing a law against the life 
of the river, 19 The bodies of our truth are 
in bed tonight. 20 Horizon of rumor in the Tenderloin, 
under red light, 21 Parade of clouds as far as 
the Barbary Coast, 22 In the back rooms, in pilot-houses, 
past thick reeds whistling, 23 Through swamps silvered with marvelous 
adolescents, 24 The girl of Eden admitting all her life. 
25 Singing on the moonridden cry of loons. 26 Will 
they stifle the grass and the young lying together, 27 
The Lincoln stories, the twisting and lilacs of New England? 
28 The swarming lives from the Carolinas calling 29 Truth 
and the mockingbird, the big river or the sea? 30 
The eyes of the child and the children's zodiac? 31 
Lack, rape, and silence. A summer evening, will you, 32 
Of burning crosses, of instruments of torture 33 Who pretend 
not to recognize each other? 34 Sitting on the corner 
of Main and Jackson, the half-lit 35 Limping fortunetelIer of 
all our fortunes. 36 In this one the generative secrets 
burn, 37 And he is all of us, bound in 
our same false secrets, 38 Lies concerning the communion of 
man and man, 39 Deep lies of brokenness between woman 
and man, 40 All torn apart by the mask of 
men.
