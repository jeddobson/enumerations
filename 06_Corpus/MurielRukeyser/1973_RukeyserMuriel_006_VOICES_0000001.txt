1 Voices of all our voices, running past an imagined 
race. 2 Pouring out of morning light, the pouring mists 
of Mil 3 Cumbres. 4 Out of the poured cities 
of our world. 5 Out of the black voice of 
one child 6 Who sleeps in our poverty and is 
dreaming. 7 The child perceives and the cycles are fulfilled. 
8 Cities being poured; and war-fire over the poor. 9 
Mist over the peak. 10 One child in his voices, 
many voices. 11 The suffering runs past the end of 
the racing 12 Making us run the next race. The 
child sleeps. 13 Lovers, makers, this child, enter into our 
voices. 14 Speak to the child. Now something else is 
waking: 15 The look of the lover, the rebel and 
learning look, 16 The look of the runner just beyond 
the tape, go into 17 The child's look at the 
world. In all its voices. 1
