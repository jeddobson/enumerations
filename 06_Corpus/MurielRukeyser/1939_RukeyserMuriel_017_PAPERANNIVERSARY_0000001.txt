1 The concert-hall was crowded the night of the Crash 
2 but the wives were away; many mothers gone sick 
to their beds 3 or waiting at home for late 
extras and latest telephone calls 4 had sent their sons 
and daughters to hear music instead. 5 I came late 
with my father; and as the car flowed stop 6 
I heard the Mozart developing through the door 7 where 
the latecomers listened; water-leap, season of coolness, 8 talisman of 
relief; but they worried, they did not hear. 9 Into 
the hall of formal rows and the straight-sitting seats 10 
(they took out pencils, they muttered at the program's margins) 
11 began the double concerto, Brahms' season of fruit 12 
but they could not meet it with love; they were 
lost with their 13 fortunes. 14 In that hall was 
no love where love was often felt 15 reaching for 
music, or for the listener beside: 16 orchids and violins---precision 
dances of pencils 17 rode down the paper as the 
music rode. 18 Intermission with its spill of lights found 
heavy 19 breathing and failure pushing up the aisles, 20 
or the daughters of failure greeting each other under 21 
the eyes of an old man who has gone mad 
and fails. 22 And this to end the cars, the 
trips abroad, the summer 23 countries of palmtrees, toy moneys, 
curt affairs, 24 ending all music for the evening-dress audience. 
25 Fainting in telephone booth, the broker swears. 26 "I 
was cleaned out at Forty---" "No golf tomorrow" "Father!" 27 
but fathers there were none, only a rout of men 
28 stampeded in a flaming circle; and they return 29 
from the telephones and run down the velvet lane 30 
as the lights go down and the Stravinsky explodes 31 
spasms of rockets to levels near delight, 32 and the 
lawyer thinks of his ostrich-feather wife 33 lying alone, and 
knows it is getting late. 34 He journeys up the 
aisle, and as Debussy begins, 35 drowning the concert-hall, many 
swim up and out, 36 distortions of water carry their 
bodies through 37 the deformed image of a crippled heart. 
38 The age of the sleepless and the sealed arrives. 
39 The music spent. Hard-breathing, they descend, 40 wait at 
the door or at the telephone. 41 While from the 
river streams a flaw of wind, 42 washing our sight; 
while all the fathers lie 43 heavy upon their graves, 
the line of cars progresses 44 toward the blue park, 
and the lobby darkens, and we 45 go home again 
to the insane governess. 46 The night is joy, and 
the music was joy alive, 47 alive is joy, but 
it will never be 48 upon this scene upon these 
fathers these cars 49 for the windows already hold photography 
50 of the drowned faces the fat the unemployed--- 51 
pressed faces lie upon the million glass 52 and the 
sons and daughters turn their startled faces 53 and see 
that startled face.
