1 The tarpaper shack and the red rose bush. 2 
Smoking crystal of the hill. 3 The brush of the 
shorelines, fever in its sting. 4 Don't tell me the 
water's still risin! 5 Go down to the rail gate, 
see where the rundown is. 6 There is a cloud 
on this house and the smoking crystal 7 Holds waters 
that will drench the oil lamp out. 8 One flashflood 
left me only my coffeepot. 9 That's nature's way, my 
walnut Granther said. 10 The dragons of burning ran along 
the mountain 11 A scar lighting the overflow; the forest 
12 Pulls back from the highway, in mortal insult. 13 
Spring bringing floodwaters. Now the Negroes come 14 Over the 
runoff sloping, ankle-deep, with their blues 15 And watermelon smiles. 
They know the suffering flood, 16 They are dark and 
they sing. They know potential joy, 17 Flames, lightning, and 
the gully-buried man; 18 All the sky-stars and all the 
leaves on the tree. 19 Joy white and absolute, potential 
joy. 20 Ice and snow melting in the spring. Amen. 
21 Who shall bar with his arms the heavy rains? 
22 Had me a man, the man pleased me. Amen. 
23 From kinsee to caintsee it's been rainin here, 24 
I never longed west of the Mississippi. Amen. 25 Downpours 
standin up to the bankgrass, 26 I've been a good 
wife. I want the snowfed Trinity. Amen. 27 Water spread 
over a lake to the windowsill 28 The tin cans 
silver, my kitchen window plants. Amen. 29 My brooms, my 
yard goods, the honeysuckle vines, 30 And three left shoes 
go washing past the bank. Amen. 31 Drowning of a 
deal table and eighteen head of cattle. 32 The whole 
section's under water and me singin Amen. 33 I do 
sing Amen. 34 But next life, next life, or maybe 
next year, Lord, 35 Lay lightning across your river and 
your poor woman's Amen. 36 Amen, Amen. 37 I do 
sing Amen.
