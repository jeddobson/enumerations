for Helen Lynd 1 Between the illuminations of great mornings 
2 there comes the dailiness of doing and being 3 
and the hand as it makes as it brightens burnishes 
4 the surfaces seemings mirrors of the world 5 We 
do not know the springs of these colored and loving 
6 acts or what triggers birth what sleep is 7 
but name them as we name bird-wakened morning 8 having 
our verbs of the world 9 to which all action 
seems 10 to resolve, being 11 to go, to grow, 
to flow, to shine, to sound, to glow, 12 to 
give and to take, to bind and to separate, 13 
to injure and to defend 14 we do not even 
not even know why we wake 15 but some of 
us showing the others 16 a kind of welcoming 17 
bringing a form to morning 18 as a woman who 
recognizes 19 may offer us the moment and the names 
20 turning all shame into a declaration 21 immediately to 
be followed by 22 an act of truth 23 until 
all seemings are 24 illumination 25 we see in a 
man a theme 26 a dream taking over 27 or 
in this woman going today who has shown us 28 
fear, and form, and storm turned into light 29 the 
dailiness of our being and doing 30 morning and every 
time the way to naming 31 and we see more 
now coming into being 32 see in her goings as 
in her arrivings 33 the opening of a door
