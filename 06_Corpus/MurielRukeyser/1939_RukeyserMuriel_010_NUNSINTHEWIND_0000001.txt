1 As I came out of the New York Public 
Library 2 you said your influence on my style would 
be noticed 3 and from now on there would be 
happy poems. 4 It was at that moment 5 the 
street was assaulted by a covey of nuns 6 going 
directly toward the physics textbooks. 7 Tragic fiascos shadowed that 
whole spring. 8 The children sang streetfuls, and I thought: 
9 O to be the King in the carol 10 
kissed and at peace; but recalling Costa Brava 11 the 
little blossoms in the mimosa tree 12 and later, the 
orange cliff, after they sent me out, 13 I knew 
there was no peace. 14 You smiled, saying : Take 
it easy. 15 That was the year of the five-day 
fall of cities. 16 First day, no writers. Second, no 
telephones. Third 17 no venereal diseases. Fourth, no income tax. 
And on 18 the fifth, at noon. 19 The nuns 
blocked the intersections, reading. 20 I used to go walking 
in the triangle of park, 21 seeing that locked face, 
the coarse enemy skin, 22 the eyes with all the 
virtues of a good child, 23 but no child was 
there, even when I thought, Child! 24 The 4 a.m. 
cop could never understand. 25 You said, not smiling, You 
are the future for me, 26 but you were the 
present and immediate moment 27 and I am empty-armed without, 
until to me is given 28 two lights to carry 
: my life and the light of my death. 29 
If the wind would rise, those black throbbing umbrellas 30 
fly downstreet, the flapping robes unfolding, 31 my dream would 
be over, poisons cannot linger 32 when the wind rises.... 
33 All that year, the classical declaration of war was 
lacking. 34 There was a lot of lechery and disorder. 
35 And I am queen on that island. 36 Well, 
I said suddenly in the tall and abstract room, 37 
time to wake up. 38 Now make believe you can 
help yourself alone. 39 And there it was, the busy 
crosstown noontime 40 crossing, peopled with nuns. 41 Now, bragging 
now, 42 that flatfoot slambang victory, 43 thanks to a 
trick of wind 44 will you see faces blow, and 
though their bodies 45 by God's grace will never blow, 
46 cities shake in the wind, the year's over, 47 
calendars tear, and their clothes blow. O yes!
