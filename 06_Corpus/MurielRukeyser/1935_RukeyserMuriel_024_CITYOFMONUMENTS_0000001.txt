Washington 1934 1 Be proud you people of these graves 
2 these chiseled words this precedent 3 From these blind 
ruins shines our monument. 4 Dead navies of the brain 
will sail 5 stone celebrate its final choice 6 when 
the air shakes, a single voice 7 a strong voice 
able to prevail : 8 Entrust no hope to stone 
although the stone 9 shelter the root : see too-great 
burdens placed 10 with nothing certain but the risk 11 
set on the infirm column of 12 the high memorial 
obelisk 13 erect in accusation sprung against 14 a barren 
sky taut over Anacostia : 15 give over, Gettysburg ! 
a word will shake your glory : 16 blood of 
the starved fell thin upon this plain, 17 this battle 
is not buried with its slain. 18 Gravestone and battlefield 
retire 19 the whole green South is shadowed dark, 20 
the slick white domes are cast in night. 21 But 
uneclipsed above the park 22 the veteran of the Civil 
War 23 sees havoc in the tended graves 24 the 
midnight bugles blown to free 25 still unemancipated slaves. 26 
Blinded by chromium or transfiguration 27 we watch, as through 
a microscope, decay : 28 down the broad streets the 
limousines 29 advance in passions of display. 30 Air glints 
with diamonds, and these clavicles 31 emerge through orchids by 
whose trailing spoor 32 the sensitive cannot mistake 33 the 
implicit anguish of the poor. 34 The throats incline, the 
marble men rejoice 35 careless of torrents of despair. 36 
Split by a tendril of revolt 37 stone cedes to 
blossom everywhere.
