1 Standing against the gorge, he sees the slides of 
light. 2 Where lightning lay, they are building. The surfaces 
are lit. 3 The dam that is almost finished stands 
in seamless night 4 Declaring its form with a clear 
speaking. 5 The man leans on his railing. He thinks 
: I will listen. 6 Bulbs of violent light swing 
on their own wires, 7 Lines of the downstream face 
flow down the slope of dream. 8 Spillway of loyalties 
shining, the gate of fire. 9 He forgets the police 
on a hot summer night long past 10 Later finding 
the wound between his shoulder blades; 11 He thinks of 
the women opened before him, flowers of 12 summer, 13 
The first cry of his son at which all waterfalls 
14 Waited like streams of wine bitter in Spain. 15 
Riches of breathing, fantastic poverty. 16 The running of stones 
in this riverbed. 17 Corngreen and fields of thirst, he 
thinks. I know a woman 18 The river of whose 
mouth, whose sea of flowers 19 I saw in the 
hot fields of the past, at night. 20 Over all 
images a lightning stroke of law 21 Has been laid 
across, white structure on the river 22 To stop my 
profit's streams, to make a tree 23 Celebrating the years 
of growth and form. 24 The pacemaker image. A pulse 
and pattern of light. 25 The mirror image of my 
waste, in the ferocious cities 26 Whose roaring and giant 
fibres find my exultation 27 Outward in the shout, while 
what I stare at is 28 The dam I tried 
to murder for years; or sail 29 In a boat 
the color of violins among 30 A school of condoms 
floating in the Sound. 31 Beyond naming, waste! The legs 
of the withered man. 32 My summons from the great 
web and the woman 33 In glimpses accepted, for long 
forgot. I think 34 I am wheat dormant in the 
seedman's hand.
