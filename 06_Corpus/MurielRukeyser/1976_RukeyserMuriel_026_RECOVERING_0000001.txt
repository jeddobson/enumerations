1 Dream of the world 2 speaking to me. 3 
The dream of the dead 4 acted out in me. 
5 The fathers shouting 6 across their blue gulf. 7 
A storm in each word, 8 an incomplete universe. 9 
Lightning in brain, 10 slow-time recovery. 11 In the light 
of October 12 things emerge clear. 13 The force of 
looking 14 returns to my eyes. 15 Darkness arrives 16 
splitting the mind open. 17 Something again 18 is beginning 
to be born. 19 A dance is 20 dancing me. 
21 I wake in the dark.
