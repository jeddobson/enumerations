1 This is going to be about smoke. 2 Blindness, 
shouting of smoke, the dice pitted with mines 3 and 
tunnels. 4 Black hills, flights of paper over the lines 
of glaciers, 5 Railway stations in the zebra hour of 
morning 6 When the only ones awake are the mothers 
of infants 7 Staring at dawn, sky of the fountains. 
8 Smoke 9 Of hotels, of women wanting to be 
raped, of the plush sofas 10 That long only to 
float into empty houses. 11 Smoke of concessions, the crystal 
chandeliers 12 Whose teardrops ring and say, Choose between evils, 
13 You live in the world, you must learn to 
choose between evils. 14 Two gray colors of smoke waiting 
to be chosen. 15 Will nobody tell them? They do 
not seem to know. 16 I will. My brothers of 
smoke, my brothers, 17 You do not have to choose 
between evils.
