1 Over the water, where I lie alive, 2 Grass 
burns green where the buried are, 3 Tall stone is 
standing "And the sea 4 Gave up its dead." The 
wave, the living star, 5 Evening and house at river-mouth 
shine. 6 The hour of voices on the water and 
oars 7 Speaking of blue, speaking of time. 8 His 
colors, colors of deepness will arrive, 9 Island-sleep, keel-sleep, cloud-controlling 
evening. 10 They say to me at last "I am 
your home."
