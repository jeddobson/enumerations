1 "Look!" he said, "all green!" but she, 2 leaning 
against him at her hospital door, 3 received it on 
her eyes as fireline blinding bright 4 and would not 
see. 5 "Come into the park!" he offered her, 6 
but she was feverstruck still, brimful of white 7 monotonous 
weakness, and could not face the grass 8 and the 
bright water. 9 A boy skating upstreet 10 shouted; the 
gardener climbed at the doorway, pruning, 11 and the gay 
branches dropped where she stood, fearful 12 of her quick 
heartbeat 13 released, fearing the kiss 14 of vivid blood. 
The husband straightened in the sun, 15 risking their staggered 
histories against the violent 16 avenue's emphasis; 17 "A long 
pain, long fever!" 18 He faced her full for the 
first time, speaking, 19 turned with his hand her face 
to meet his mouth, 20 "but that death's over." 21 
Lights out; noon falls 22 steeply away, blazing in green; 
he sees the sharp fear pass 23 verdict upon her, 
pitching and frothing toward the 24 mechanical white walls.
