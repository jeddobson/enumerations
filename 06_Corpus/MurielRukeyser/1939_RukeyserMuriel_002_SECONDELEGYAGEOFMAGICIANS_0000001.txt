1 A baroque night advances in its clouds, 2 maps 
strain loose and are lost, the flash-flood breaks, 3 the 
lifting moonflare lights this field a moment, 4 while death 
as a skier curves along the snows, 5 death as 
an acrobat swings year to year, 6 turns down to 
us the big face of a nurse. 7 Roads open 
black, and the magicians come. 8 The aim of magicians 
is inward pleasure. 9 The prophet lives by faith and 
not by sight, 10 Being a visionary, he is divided, 
11 or Cain, forever shaken by his crime. 12 Magnetic 
ecstasy, a trance of doom 13 mean the magician, worshipping 
a darkness 14 with gongs and lurid guns, the colors 
of force. 15 He is against the unity of light. 
16 The Magician has his symbols, brings up his children 
by them: 17 the march-step, the staircase at night, the 
long cannon. 18 The children grow in authority and become 
19 Molitor, Dr. Passavant, powerful Dr. Falcon, 20 bring their 
professors, and soon may govern 21 the zone, the zodiac, 
the king on his throne. 22 "Because the age holds 
its own dangers. 23 Because snow comes with lightnings, omens 
with all seasons." 24 (The Prophet covers his face against 
the wall, 25 weeps, fights to think again, to plan 
to start 26 the dragon, the ecliptic, and the heart.) 
27 The Magician lifts himself higher than the world. 28 
The Prophets were more casual. They endured, 29 and in 
the passive dread of solitude 30 heard calls, followed veiled, 
in midnight humility. 31 They claimed no preference, they separated 
32 unity from blindness 33 living from burning 34 tribute 
from tribute. 35 They have gone under, and do they 
come again? 36 The index of prophecy is light 37 
and steeped therein 38 the world with all its signatures 
visible. 39 Does this life permit its living to wear 
strength? 40 Who gives it, protects it. It is food. 
41 Who refuses it, it eats in time as food. 
42 It is the world and it eats the world. 
43 Who knows this, knows. This has been said. 44 
This is the vision in the age of magicians: 45 
it stands at immense barriers, before mountains: 46 'I came 
to you in the form of a line of men, 
47 and when you threw down the paper, and when 
you sat at the play, 48 and when you killed 
the spider, and when you saw the shadow 49 of 
the fast plane skim fast over your lover's face. 50 
And when you saw the table of diplomats, 51 the 
newsreel of ministers, the paycut slip, 52 the crushed child's 
head, clean steel, factories, 53 the chessmen on the marble 
of the floor, 54 each flag a country, each chessman 
a live man, 55 one side advancing southward to the 
pit, 56 one side advancing northward to the lake, 57 
and when you saw the tree, half bright half burning. 
58 You never inquired into these meanings. 59 If you 
had done this, you would have been restored.' 60 The 
word is war. 61 And there is a prediction that 
you are the avenger. 62 They cut the people's hands, 
and their shoulders were left, 63 they cut their feet 
off, and their thighs were whole, 64 they cut them 
down to the torse, but the voice shouted, 65 they 
cut the head off, but the heart rang out. 66 
And in the residential districts, where nothing ever happens, 67 
armies of magicians filled the streets, 68 shouting 69 Need! 
Bread! Blood! Death! 70 And all this is because of 
you. 71 And all this is avenged by you. 72 
Your index light, your voice the voice, 73 your tree 
half green and half burning, 74 half dead half bright, 
75 your cairns, your beacons, your tree in green and 
flames, 76 unbending smoke in the sky, planes' noise, the 
darkness, 77 magic to fight. Much to restore, now know. 
Now be 78 Seer son of Sight, Hearer, of Ear, 
at last.
