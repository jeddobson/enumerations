1 Give them my regards when you go to the 
school reunion; 2 and at the marriage-supper, say that I'm 
thinking about them. 3 They'll remember my name; I went 
to the movies with that one, 4 feeling the weight 
of their death where she sat at my elbow; 5 
she never said a word, 6 but all of them 
were heard. 7 all of them alike, expensive girls, the 
leaden friends : 8 one used to play the piano, 
one of them once wrote a sonnet, 9 one even 
seemed awakened enough to photograph wheat- 10 fields--- 11 the 
dull girls with the educated minds and technical passions--- 12 
pure love was their employment, 13 they tried it for 
enjoyment. 14 Meet them at the boat : they've brought 
the souvenirs of 15 boredom, 16 a seashell from the 
faltering monarchy; 17 the nose of a marble saint; and 
from the battlefield, 18 an empty shell divulged from a 
flower-bed. 19 The lady's wealthy breath 20 perfumes the air 
with death. 21 The leaden lady faces the fine, voluptuous 
woman, 22 faces a rising world bearing its gifts in 
its hands. 23 Kisses her casual dreams upon the lips 
she kisses, 24 risen, she moves away; takes others; moves 
away. 25 Inadequate to love, 26 supposes she's enough. 27 
Give my regards to the well-protected woman, 28 I knew 
the ice-cream girl, we went to school together. 29 There's 
something to bury, people, when you begin to bury. 30 
When your women are ready and rich in their wish 
for the 31 world, 32 destroy the leaden heart, 33 
we've a new race to start.
