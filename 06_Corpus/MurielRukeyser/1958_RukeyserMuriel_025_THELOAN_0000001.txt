1 You told me resurrection in images of roots, 2 
Taking upon your summer my defeats. 3 Now I take 
on myself your wound's meaning 4 Private self-given torment, on 
my mouth. 5 The open grave stood in your eyes 
6 Past the colors of our meeting--- 7 Stain-moon, accepted 
curse of a false sun 8 Your guardians rising at 
your head. 9 A mask sang out, swinging away, 10 
The verdicts proven fallacies, 11 "Lay you sweetly down to 
bed!"--- 12 But the mask cannot kiss this away, nor 
wake--- 13 Only you can wake, making go on to 
make; 14 Even when all your hope 15 Is buried 
dreaming, 16 The meanings move. Though my words are a 
loan, 17 Though your body I love vanish 18 Evading 
through our century among 19 These nightmare judgments of innocence 
and guilt. 20 All that I know from you of 
resurrection 21 Be passed on as branches, as one leaf. 
22 Even the root of need. 23 The wound reaches 
its opposite, shines on my face, a flower 24 Bright 
among violence, the passion that is peace. 25 We have 
promises to make: 26 We saw that in each other's 
eyes. 27 Not to accept the curse, but wake, 28 
Never to act in formal innocence. 29 It was not 
the maze of the time 30 But possibility we felt 
31 In full gaze as we began to wake. 32 
Not the lock of these years of silence, 33 We 
knew lack, we knew withholding, but there was more, the 
34 body of love said so--- 35 Deep it was 
buried, but it lay there, in all eyes, in the 
meaning 36 of sex 37 Waiting for more life, for 
it was more, and lively, 38 More a child running 
in the fields for his joy of running, 39 A 
running like creation, beginning now to make 40 Day and 
idea, his acts, his dreams, his waking, 41 His live 
ideas of innocence.
