1 Raging from every quarter 2 The winds attack this 
house 3 With its great gardens 4 Whose rose-established order 
5 Gives it its graciousness, 6 Its legendary fountains 7 
The darkness of whose forest 8 Gives it its long 
repose. 9 Among these fountains walks 10 Walpurga, goddess of 
springs, 11 And of her summer stalks 12 A gift 
has been given--- 13 Old sorrows, old beginnings, 14 Matured 
a summer wreath. 15 I offer it to you. 16 
There is no storm can tear 17 Miracles made of 
grief, 18 Horror, and deepest love. 19 Under enchantment 20 
I lived a frightful summer 21 Before I understood. 22 
It had its roots in God 23 And it bred 
good love 24 And hatred and the rare 25 Revelation 
of fear. 26 Women who in my time 27 Move 
toward a wider giving 28 Than warm kitchen offering 29 
And warm steady living 30 Know million ignorance 31 Or 
petty village shame, 32 And come to acknowledge the world 
33 As a world of common blame. 34 Beyond the 
men of letters, 35 Of business and of death, 36 
They draw a rarer breath, 37 Have no career but 
choice. 38 Choice is their image; they 39 Choose the 
myth they obey. 40 The world of man's selection 41 
May widen more and more. 42 Women in drudgery knew 
43 They must be one of four: 44 Whores, artists, 
saints, and wives. 45 There are composite lives 46 That 
women always live 47 Whose greatness is to give 48 
Weakness its reasons 49 And strength its reassurance; 50 To 
kiss away the waste 51 Places and start them well. 
52 From three such women I 53 Accepted gifts of 
life 54 Grown in these gardens 55 And nourished in 
a season 56 That forced our choices on us 57 
Taking away our pardons, 58 Showing us in a mirror 
59 Interminable girlhood 60 Or the free pain and terror 
61 To accept and choose 62 Before we could be 
free. 63 Toward such a victory 64 Crusades have moved, 
and peace, 65 And holy stillnesses. 66 These women moved 
alone, 67 Clothed in their suffering--- 68 The fiery pain 
of children, 69 The horror of the grown, 70 And 
the pure, the intense 71 Moments of music and light 
72 That let us live in the night 73 Of 
the soul and the world's pain. 74 O flayed Vesalian 
man 75 Bent over your shovel, 76 You will find 
agony 77 And all the fears that rave: 78 Dig 
in anyone's shadow, 79 You find a turning grave. 80 
But there are victories 81 That finally are given: 82 
A child's awareness 83 Listening at a wall 84 To 
Mozart's heaven of music 85 In a forgetful town. 86 
The flowering wild call 87 From a dark balcony 88 
Through fever, war and madness 89 To the world's lover. 
90 The suffering that discovers 91 Gambler and saint, and 
brings 92 A possibility 93 Wherein we breathe and live. 
94 These three are emblems of need: 95 Now they 
struggle together 96 In a dark forest 97 Bound as 
a painful wreath; 98 Are in that war defiled, 99 
Obsessive to be freed. 100 Let the last meanings arrive! 
101 These three will be reconciled, 102 Young and immortal 
and lovely: 103 The tall and truthful child, 104 The 
challenger's intricacies, 105 Her struggles and her tenderness; 106 And 
the pursued, who cries 107 "Renunciation!" in a scarlet dress--- 
108 Three naked women saying Yes 109 Among the calling 
lakes, the silver trees, 110 The bird-calling and the fallen 
grass, 111 The wood-shadow and the water-shadow. 112 I know 
your gifts, you women offering. 113 Whatever attacks your lives, 
your images, 114 And in what net of time you 
are trapped, or freed, 115 I tell you that all 
of you make gifts that we 116 Need in their 
opposition and will need 117 While earth contains ambivalence. 118 
I praise you in the dark and intense forest, 119 
I will always remember you, 120 Fair head, pale head, 
shining head; 121 Your rich eyes and generous hands 122 
And the links underneath 123 Your lives. 124 Now, led 
125 By this unbreakable wreath 126 Mrs. Walpurga moves 127 
Among her fountains.
