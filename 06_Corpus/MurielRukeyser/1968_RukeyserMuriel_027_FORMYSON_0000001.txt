1 You come from poets, kings, bankrupts, preachers, 2 attempted 
bankrupts, builders of cities, salesmen, 3 the great rabbis, the 
kings of Ireland, failed drygoods 4 storekeepers, beautiful women of 
the songs, 5 great horsemen, tyrannical fathers at the shore 
of ocean, the 6 western mothers looking west beyond from 
their 7 windows, 8 the families escaping over the sea 
hurriedly and by night--- 9 the roundtowers of the Celtic 
violet sunset, 10 the diseased, the radiant, fliers, men thrown 
out of town, the 11 man bribed by his cousins 
to stay out of town, teachers, 12 the cantor on 
Friday evening, the lurid newspapers, 13 strong women gracefully holding 
relationship, the Jewish girl 14 going to parochial school, the 
boys racing their iceboats 15 on the Lakes, 16 the 
woman still before the diamond in the velvet window, say- 
17 ing "Wonder of nature." 18 Like all men, 19 
you come from singers, the ghettoes, the famines, wars and 
20 refusal of wars, men who built villages 21 that 
grew to our solar cities, students, revolutionists, the pouring of 
buildings, the market newspapers, 22 a poor tailor in a 
darkening room, 23 a wilderness man, the hero of mines, 
the astronomer, a white- 24 faced woman hour on hour 
teaching piano and her 25 crippled wrist, 26 like all 
men, 27 you have not seen your father's face 28 
but he is known to you forever in song, the 
coast of the skies, 29 in dream, wherever you find 
man play playing his part 30 as father, father among 
our light, among our darkness, 31 and in your self 
made whole, whole with yourself and whole 32 with others, 
33 the stars your ancestors.
