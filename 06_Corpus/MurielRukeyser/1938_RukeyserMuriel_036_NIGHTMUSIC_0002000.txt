deck? 147 What rising? What memory of ocean? 148 What 
is it ripples and rises? 149 The drowned heart, lifted 
a moment 150 answers clearly Here it comes. 151 And 
get your feet wet in a drowning world? 152 Stand 
on a rotten dock, obsessed with tide? 153 The boat's 
condemned, the pier sinks. The long port 154 offers an 
only country to you, traveller, 155 a chance of upper 
air to hopeful, smothering heart.99 Give a dime to a 
beggar for I have seen a sight 100 children grown 
tall and tragic reason slight 101 charity dealt the poor 
again 102 I drove with my last love last night 
103 through Clinton Street where sick, sick, sick 104 the 
pushcarts screened with oranges 105 staggering avenues of brick 106 
and wealth and love were long away 107 and this 
man wished the old love quick. 108 Give more and 
get your dollars back all dimes 109 small change of 
love: so lied, and kissed him tight. 110 I saw 
his tired body gone to crust 111 and chuckling pigeons 
take him in their throats. 112 ---Now see us older, 
foolish, refugee, 113 the child awake with an advertising look 
114 gathering speed in motors, love in dimes--- 115 what's 
after driving at night, answering joylessly? 116 The wasted pity. 
Thieving charity.117 With those two I went driving in the 
dark, 118 out from our town in a borrowed car 
whose light 119 ate forests as we drove deeper into 
the park. 120 Beloved, spoke the sweet equivocal night--- 121 
those two stood clapped, each breast warmly on breast, 122 
I stood apart to remove them from my sight : 
123 The creased brook ran in continual unrest, 124 rising 
to seastorm in the rioting mind. 125 Here night and 
they and I---and who was merriest? 126 He turned his 
face away refusing, and so signed 127 for her to 
stop who too was comfortless 128 and equally needy, as 
tender and as blind. 129 On the road to the 
city stood the hedge whose darkness 130 had covered me 
months ago with that tall stranger 131 as foreign to 
me as this loneliness, 132 as enemy to me as 
tonight's anger 133 of grief in the country, shut with 
those two in the park: 134 this crying, frantic at 
removal, the dark, the sorrowful 135 danger.136 Watching, on piers, 
exuberant travellers 137 enter the ocean where the beggar sits 
138 desperate at exclusive waterfronts, 139 see how the feasted 
boat leaves port 140 covered with singing birds. 141 Cruising 
to cellophane islands, shaking off 142 this city's rock providing 
lonely tours, 143 grim single passports, persevering winter, 144 the 
ship slides down midnight's imperious harbor 145 The gilt-tiered galleries 
awake and dance. 146 What is it rippling across the 
deck? 147 What rising? What memory of ocean? 148 What 
is it ripples and rises? 149 The drowned heart, lifted 
a moment 150 answers clearly Here it comes. 151 And 
get your feet wet in a drowning world? 152 Stand 
on a rotten dock, obsessed with tide? 153 The boat's 
condemned, the pier sinks. The long port 154 offers an 
only country to you, traveller, 155 a chance of upper 
air to hopeful, smothering heart.156 When those who can never 
again forgive themselves 157 finish their dinner, rear up from 
the chair, 158 turning to movies are caught in demonstrations 
159 sweeping the avenues---Meet them there. 160 Watch how their 
faces change like traffic-light 161 bold blood gone green as 
horses pound the street, 162 as plates of sweated muscle 
push 163 them squarely back into retreat. 164 Notice their 
tremulous late overthrow 165 caught irresponsible : as the first 
rank presses 166 up at the brown animal breast of 
law 167 defying government by horses. 168 And after the 
quick night-flurry, the few jailed, 169 the march stampeded, the 
meeting stopped, go down 170 night-streets to unique rooms where 
horror ends, 171 strike-songs are sung and the old songs 
remain. 172 Vaguely Ilonka draws her violin 173 along to 
Bach, greatest of trees, whereunder 174 earth is again familiar, 
grandmother, 175 and very god-music branches overhead. 176 Changeable spirit! 
build a newer music 177 rich enough to feed starvation 
on. 178 Course down the night, past scenes of horror, 
among 179 children awake, lands ruined, begging men. 180 Rebel 
against torment, 181 boats gone, night-battles, the sleepers up and 
shaking, 182 fear in the streets 183 cruelty on awaking. 
184 Make music out of night will change the night.156
