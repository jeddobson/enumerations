Dear Sir, my name is Mearl Blankenship. 18 I have 
Worked for the rhinehart & Dennis Co 19 Many days 
& many nights 20 & it was so dusty you 
couldn't hardly see the lights. 21 I helped nip steel 
for the drills 22 & helped lay the track in 
the tunnel 23 & done lots of drilling near the 
mouth of the tunnell 24 & when the shots went 
off the boss said 25 If you are going to 
work Venture back 26 & the boss was Mr. Andrews 
27 & now he is dead and gone 28 But 
I am still here 29 a lingering along 30 He 
stood against the rock 31 facing the river 32 grey 
river grey face 33 the rock mottled behind him 34 
like X-ray plate enlarged 35 diffuse and stony 36 his 
face against the stone. 37 J C Dunbar said that 
I was the very picture of health 38 when I 
went to Work at that tunnel. 39 I have lost 
eighteen lbs on that Rheinhart ground 40 and expecting to 
loose my life 41 & no settlement yet & I 
have sued the Co. twice 42 But when the lawyers 
got a settlement 43 they didn't want to talk to 
me 44 But I didn't know whether they were sleepy 
or not. 45 I am a Married Man and have 
a family. God 46 knows if they can do anything 
for me 47 it will be appreciated 48 if you 
can do anything for me 49 let me know soon
