1 The sickness poured through the roads, 2 The vineyards 
shook. 3 A clot formed on the wild river. 4 
The streets and squares were full of crevices. 5 Poison 
ran on the church-towers. 6 The olive trees! 7 He 
shook for thirty years, 8 Held his buttocks tense while 
his varnished officers 9 Broke thighs, broke fingers. 10 A 
man dies. 11 The genitals of the South are broken. 
12 Venom pours 13 Into his provinces of pain. 14 
The surgeons come. 15 Are there children left alive 16 
Among his bones? The drugs of choice are used, 17 
Sleep-poison, torture-dream-drink, elixir of silence, 18 Rousing of memory : 
the inquisition. 19 Purgation of the future. "Cut off this 
lobe," they said. 20 "The heart is rejecting the present." 
On the roads 21 The dead of the resistance tried 
to stand 22 Again, they tried to stand again. 23 
But they were dead. 24 The surgeons are cutting out 
his words. 25 Too late; all the children are silent. 
26 On the central plateau, snow is falling. 27 Incisions 
split the open country. On the coast of pain, 28 
All craft becalmed. The surgeons are singing. 29 No, of 
course the dragon is not dead. 30 A branch of 
a tree is dead. 31 A generation is dead. 32 
Most of the living are silent. 33 Prepare the ink 
on the rollers; 34 This has been a long time 
coming. 35 The posters carry one word: 36 Today! 37 
Send the word underground, where water flows, 38 Clear, pure, 
black. 39 Is it beyond taint? 40 No, it is 
not beyond taint. 41 Certain women and men look at 
us out of their eyes. 42 Do they begin to 
speak 43 They have been speaking all along. 44 We 
can tell by their eyes, 45 Although their mouths are 
broken. 46 Now they are healing their mouths; 47 They 
have been speaking during all this dead lifetime. 48 Has 
the dragon died? 49 Something is beginning to be born, 
50 But the seeds of the dragon are also growing 
in the fresh 51 wombs of girls. 52 O love.
