1 We stood around the raw new-planted garden 2 Parables 
green and yellow in the ground 3 The old man 
with his branch paced the diagonal 4 The rare Negro 
girl accepted a forked branch 5 And paced her line 
The corners of an ancient 6 Dance-figure now we were 
as we stood watching 7 Everything was there in the 
moment there 8 Random and light in the dance on 
young grass flaming up 9 While the old man held 
his branch and walked toward water 10 Walked to that 
moment where the branch dives down 11 We stood in 
the moment random funny rare 12 Everything here and everything 
contained 13 In a strong diving a diving of the 
swan's strong neck 14 Diving of prayer leaping to find 
deep under 15 Reason and rock the cold sweet-driven springs 
16 Everything being here in the moment here 17 Belief 
and disbelief the dry light on the grass 18 And 
the old man with lit eyes 19 Calculations of willow, 
predictions done in peach-branch 20 Dancing of the young dark 
over wellwater 21 The way we guess where lies the 
buried life 22 But not for days after the eyes 
and dance 23 Did the deep fountain show Do they 
divine each other? 24 The man drove true the moment 
was all water 25 And time the branch drove and 
the hand of man 26 It shines awake it glitters 
on the grass 27 Now waters divine man we all 
know what he was
