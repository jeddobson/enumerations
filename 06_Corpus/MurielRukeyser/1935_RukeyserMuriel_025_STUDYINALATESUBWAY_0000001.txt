1 The moon revolves outside; possibly, black air 2 turns 
so around them facing night's concave, 3 momentum the slogan 
of their hurling brains 4 swung into speed, crying for 
stillness high 5 suspended and rising on time's wave. 6 
Did these tracks have a wilder life in the ground? 
7 beaten from streams of metal in secret earth : 
8 energy travels along the veins of steel, 9 their 
faces rush forward, missiles of discontent 10 thrown vaguely to 
the south and north. 11 That head is jointed loosely 
on his neck, 12 his glossy eyes turn on the 
walls and floor : 13 her face is a blank 
breast with sorrow 14 spouting at the mouth's nipple. All 
eyes move 15 heavily to the opening door, 16 regarding 
in dullness how we also enter. 17 An angle of 
track charges up to us, swings 18 out and past 
in a firework of signals. 19 Sleepily others dangle by 
one hand 20 tense and semi-crucified things. 21 Speed welcomes 
us in explosions of night : here 22 is wrath 
and fortitude and motion's burning : 23 the world buries 
the directionless, until 24 the heads are sprung in awareness 
or drowned in peace. 25 Sleep will happen. We must 
give them morning.
