1 The bubbles in the blood sprang free, 2 crying 
from roots, from Darwin's beard. 3 The angel of the 
century 4 stood on the night and would be heard; 
5 turned to my dream of tears and sang: 6 
Woman, American, and Jew, 7 three guardians watch over you, 
8 three lions of heritage 9 resist the evil of 
your age: 10 life, freedom, and memory. 11 And all 
the dreams cried from the camps 12 and all the 
steel of torture rang. 13 The angel of the century 
14 stood on the night and cried the great 15 
notes Give Create and Fight--- 16 while war 17 runs 
through your veins, while life 18 a bubble of air 
stands in your throat, 19 answer the silence of the 
weak: 20 Speak!
