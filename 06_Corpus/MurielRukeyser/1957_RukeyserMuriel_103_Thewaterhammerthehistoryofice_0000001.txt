1 The water-hammer, the history of ice, 2 The rising 
water and the entrapped air. 3 Drift-pinned, drift-bolted, the rage 
beats at the gates. 4 The crest gates and the 
wheeled gates' seals give way. 5 When the forces pass 
the limits of the dam, 6 There is pure overturning. 
In height, in fetch, 7 The waves increase, the floors 
of galleries 8 Give way. The roots of the forest 
trees open a path, 9 Open, in bedrock, seams. Scarring 
and scouring, now 10 Flood-flow and future floods begin to 
shine. 11 Â¶ For of the soul the body form 
doth take; 12 The soul is form and doth the 
body make. 13 Here the journey is begun again.
