1 In the human cities, never again to 2 despise 
the backside of the city, the ghetto, 3 or build 
it again as we build the despised 4 backsides of 
houses. Look at your own building. 5 You are the 
city. 6 Among our secrecies, not to despise our Jews 
7 (that is, ourselves) or our darkness, our blacks, 8 
or in our sexuality wherever it takes us 9 and 
we now know we are productive 10 too productive, too 
reproductive 11 for our present invention---never to despise 12 the 
homosexual who goes building another 13 with touch with touch 
(not to despise any touch) 14 each like himself, like 
herself each. 15 You are this. 16 In the body's 
ghetto 17 never to go despising the asshole 18 nor 
the useful shit that is our clean clue 19 to 
what we need. Never to despise 20 the clitoris in 
her least speech. 21 Never to despise in myself what 
I have been taught 22 to despise. Nor to despise 
the other. 23 Not to despise the it . To 
make this relation 24 with the it : to know 
that I am it.
