for Joby West 1 You told me : they all 
went in and saw the glass, 2 The tourists, and 
I with them, a busload of them, a boatload 3 
Out from Venice. We saw the glass making. 4 Until 
I, longing for air---longing for something---walked 5 outside 6 And 
found my way along the building and around. 7 Suddenly 
there the dazzle, all the colors, fireworks and jewels in 
8 a mound 9 Flashing from the heap of glass 
thrown away. Not quite 10 perfect. Perhaps a little flawed. 
Chipped, perhaps. 11 Here is one. 12 And handed me 
the blue. 13 I looked into your eyes 14 Who 
walked around Murano 15 And I saw far behind, the 
face of the child I carried outdoors 16 that night. 
17 You were four. You looked up into the great 
tree netting all of 18 night 19 And saw fire-points 
in the tree, and asked, "Do birds eat 20 stars?" 
21 Behind your eyes the seasons, the times, 22 assemble; 
dazzle; are here.
