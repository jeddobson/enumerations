its flowing streams about these pieces 221 and under the 
sides of clouds and chars the branches. 222 It does 
not touch the flesh. Now the flesh moves, 223 the 
hacked foot and the hand and the head, 224 buttocks 
and heart, phallus and breast, compose. 225 Now the body 
is formed; and the blood of Orpheus, 226 spilled, soaked, 
and deep under the wet ground, 227 rises in fountains 
playing into the wounds. 228 Now the body is whole; 
but it is covered with murder. 229 A mist of 
blood and fire shines over the body, 230 shining upon 
the mountain, a rose of form. 231 And now the 
wounds losing self-pity change, 232 they are mouths, they are 
the many mouths of music. 233 And now they, disappear. 
He is made whole. 234 The mist dissolves into the 
body of song. 235 A lake of fire lowers, tendrils 
level to source, 236 over the mountaintop many young streams. 
237 Standing newborn and naked, Orpheus. 238 He has died 
the death of the god. 239 His gifts are to 
be made, in a newfound voice, 240 his body his 
voice. His truth has turned into life. 241 --- When 
I looked back in that night, I looked beyond love 
242 at hell. 243 All the poets and powers will 
recognize. 244 I thought the kings of Hell would recognize. 
245 I misjudged evil. --- 246 He has opened the 
door of pain. 247 It is a door and a 
window and a lens 248 opening on another land; pain 
standing wide 249 and the world crystallized in broken rains. 
250 Nightmares of scatterings are past, the disc of music 
and day 251 makes dawn and the streams make seed 
of towering fern. 252 The green night rising in flower, 
253 helmet-flower, nebula-flower, lilacs in their turrets of air, 254 
and stain of morningside bright on the low sky under 
255 new constellations of anatomy. 256 Ripple of grape, trembling 
star in the vine of water, 257 the night-goer rises 
in color before a parade of clouds. 258 Now he 
remembers the real; remembers love. 259 His life is simpler 
than the sum of its parts. 260 The arrangement is 
the life. It is the song. 261 His death is 
the birth of the god. 262 He sings the coming 
things, he sings arrivals, 263 the blood reversing from the 
soaked ground, warmth 264 passing over the lands where now 
barren resists, 265 fertile and wet invite, all in their 
way receive. 266 And all the weapons meld into his 
song. 267 The weapons, the wounds, the women his murderers. 
268 He sings the leaves of the trees, the music 
of immense forests, 269 the young arriving, the leaf of 
time and their selves 270 their crying for their needs 
and their successes, 271 developing through these to make their 
gifts. In flower. 272 All who through crises of the 
body pass 273 to the human life and the music 
of the source. 274 Are there songs rising from the 
broken sources? 275 The mountain the bright cloud and the 
cities risen. 276 The faceless and the unborn in their 
transfigured song. 277 The god a god because there are 
birth and death 278 approaching each other in their blood 
and fragments, 279 the death and birth at last identified. 
280 He has died the birth of the god. 281 
The animal and song beneath the skin, 282 seeking an 
exit, baited with food and wounds; 283 no, not an 
exit. What are they seeking? 284 Cyclic dependence the god 
and the miracle 285 needing each other, and all the 
wounds are mouths, 286 weapon to song transfigured. 287 Song 
of the air between us, of the voiceless alone, 288 
the cloud diffusing over the island country 289 pulled down 
in the shape of a plant, shape of a brain, 
290 collected into the ground and will of man. 291 
Song of the dam destroyed over the widening river 292 
in a triumph of hope; song of the flute in 
the kitchen, 293 a little bright water boiling on the 
stove. 294 Song. The frozen man, his axe in the 
sequoia; 295 blueberries, toyon berries, black galleries of coal, 296 
ferocious gestures of work and the bed of the poor. 
297 The unmade music of the power to rise, 298 
the young and unborn, the throat and hand of song. 
299 The body risen past its other life. 300 Among 
the acts and the memories he remembers--- 301 he brings 
together and he binds--- 302 among the firewind and the 
cloud chamber, 303 he is aware, he knows the nature 
of power, 304 the nature of music and the nature 
of love. 305 Knowing the enemies, those who, deprived at 
the root, 306 flourish in thorny action, having lost the 
power 307 to act essentially, they fall into the sin 
308 of all the powerless. They commit their acts of 
evil 309 in order to repent, repent and forgive, murder 
and begin again. 310 To have gone through. 311 To 
live and begin again. 312 The body alive and offering, 
313 whole, up and alive, 314 and to all men, 
man and woman, 315 and to all the unborn, 316 
the mouth shall sing 317 music past wounding 318 and 
the song begin:319 Voices and days, the exile of our 
music 320 and the dividing airs are gathered home. 321 
The hour of light and birth at last appears 322 
among the alone, in prisons of scattering. 323 Seeming of 
promise, the shining of new stars, 324 the stars of 
the real over the body of love. 325 The cloud, 
the mountain, and the cities risen. 326 Solving the wars 
of the dead, and offering dream 327 making and morning. 
Days and voices, sing 328 creation not yet come.
