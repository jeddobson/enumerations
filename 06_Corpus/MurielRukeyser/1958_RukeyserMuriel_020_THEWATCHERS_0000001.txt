for Carson and Reeves 1 She said to me, He 
lay there sleeping 2 Upon my bed cast down 3 
With all the bitterness dissolved at last, 4 An innocent 
peace within a sleeping head; 5 He could not find 
his infant war, nor turn 6 To that particular zoo, 
his family of the dead. 7 I saw her smile 
of power against his deep 8 Heart, his waking heart, 
9 Her enmity, her sexual dread. 10 He said to 
me, She slept and dreaming 11 Brought round her face 
12 Closer to me in silence than in fire, 13 
But smiled, but smiled, entering her dark life 14 Whose 
hours I never knew, wherein she smiles. 15 Wherein she 
dim descending breathes upon 16 My daylight and the color 
of waking goes. 17 Deep in his face, the wanderer 
18 Bringing the gifts of legend and the wars, 19 
Conspiracy of opposing images. 20 In the long room of 
dream I saw them sleep, 21 Turned to each other, 
clear, 22 With an obliterated look--- 23 Love, god of 
foreheads, touching then 24 Their bending foreheads while the voice 
of sleep 25 Wept and sang and sang again 26 
In a chanting of fountains, 27 A chattering of watches, 
28 Love, sang my sleep, the wavelight on the stone. 
29 I weep to go beyond this stone and the 
waterlight, 30 To kiss their eyelids for the last time 
and pass 31 From the delicate confidence of their sly 
throats, 32 The conversation of their flesh of dreams. 33 
And though I weep in my dream, 34 When I 
wake I will not weep.
