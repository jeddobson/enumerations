1 Roundabout hours of air, slanting past Massachusetts above the 
2 slate of rain, 3 Plane over the hard ocean, 
construction of rock whose law 4 Offers its gray erect. 
The strength of this bare floor 5 Appears as ledges 
where pale moss lies, and the dry ocher 6 green 
7 Of moss in these crevices seems to move a 
little; lichen the 8 color of unripe apples 9 Or 
the shadow of walking figures, ice-color hands shivering 10 Above 
rock-blue and rock-green. Figures of clouds. 11 But these quartz 
fragments and plains we know are sea. 12 However classic 
the crystal lattices, 13 Speed makes them; this storm is 
over the mind and the 14 Atlantic. 15 Work on 
the chart; and land where you can land.
