not a beach not flooded 145 nevertheless, here 146 stability 
of light 147 my other silence 148 and at my 
left hand and at my right hand 149 no longer 
wing and lighthouse 150 no longer the guardians. 151 They 
are in me, in my speechless 152 life of barrier 
beach. 153 As it lies open 154 to the night, 
out there. 155 Now seeing my death before me 156 
starting again, among the drowned men, 157 desperate men, unprotected 
discoverers, 158 and the man before me 159 here. 160 
Stroke by stroke drawing us. 161 Out there? Father of 
rhythms, 162 deep wave, mother. 163 There is no out 
there . 164 All is open. 165 Open water. Open 
I.166 The wreck of the Tiger, the early pirate, the 
blood-clam's 167 ark, the tern's acute eye, all buried mathematical 
168 instruments, castaways, pelicans, drowned five- 169 strand pearl necklaces, 
hopes of livelihood, 170 hopes of grace, 171 walls of 
houses, sepia sea-fences, the writhen octopus and those 172 tall 
masts and sails, 173 marked hulls of ships and last 
month's plane, dipping his salute 174 to the stone wing 
of dream, 175 turbulence, Diamond Shoals, the dark young living 
people: 176 "Sing one more song and you are under 
arrest." 177 "Sing another song." 178 Women, ships, lost voices. 
179 Whatever has dissolved into our waves. 180 I a 
lost voice 181 moving, calling you 182 on the edge 
of the moment that is now the center. 183 From 
the open sea.
