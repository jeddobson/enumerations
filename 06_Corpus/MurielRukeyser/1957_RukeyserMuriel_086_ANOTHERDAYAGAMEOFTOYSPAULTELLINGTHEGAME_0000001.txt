1 The father shall shine. The father shall stand at 
home. Now 2 he shall go to work. Now war. 
Now the father has to 3 wait. Now the horse 
shall give him a ride. A hahaaaa.4 Now let one 
be mad. Which one shall be mad, the father 5 
or the mother, the mother or the father? 6 No, 
the father. 7 What does he do when he is 
mad? What shall he do? 8 The father is mad 
and what shall he do? 9 The father has to 
hit the mommy. 10 Then what does the mommy do? 
11 The mommy pushes him off the table. 12 They 
have to go up again. Both of them. 13 Down 
they are. They have to walk. 14 They have to 
get up again. 15 Make believe.16 The baby is in 
the mountains, in the tall mountains. 17 You know the 
mountains? I went into my book. 18 You know my 
book of mountains. Ice, snow, far to fall. 19 I 
was the person who knows the way. 20 You must 
not stay in the mountains all night long. 21 There 
is a rope, and a man behind. 22 The mountains 
are bad. 23 They can make you dead in lots 
of ways. 24 They are prettier than a little hill, 
though, 25 Or a rose. 26 Very big, very pretty, 
and you can't understand them. 27 But the man and 
I went on and he fell. 28 He fell and 
fell because he was tired. 29 He fell in the 
holes in the snow, and he fell on the rocks, 
and he 30 would be dead all ways but I 
held him on the rope and pulled 31 him back. 
Safe. 32 I will tell you more, later on.33 In 
the closet is a man, a bad man. 34 Hitler 
shoots. He shoots me if I go there. 35 Would 
I shoot? I don't know how to shoot. 36 He 
shoots the whole house down. 37 Paul comes out now 
into the flat world. 38 It rains. It rains. 39 
Hitler never lies down. He shoots. 40 But Paul lies 
down. And now Paul is asleep. 41 What is he 
dreaming? 42 He's dreaming that now Hitler isn't Hitler. No 
more. 43 Hitler pushes up his feet like this. 44 
He is the father. Is he? 45 He pushes up 
his feet like the father.46 Yes, now they are going 
to sleep. 47 It's night. It's night.48 He's dreaming. He's 
dreaming about the day his father says, 49 It's morning 
50 And he has a little baby when he woke 
up.
