1 I first discovered what was killing these men. 2 
I had three sons who worked with their father in 
the tunnel : 3 Cecil, aged 23, Owen, aged 21, 
Shirley, aged 17. 4 They used to work in a 
coal mine, not steady work 5 for the mines were 
not going much of the time. 6 A power Co. 
foreman learned that we made home brew, 7 he formed 
a habit of dropping in evenings to drink, 8 persuading 
the boys and my husband--- 9 give up their jobs 
and take this other work. 10 It would pay them 
better. 11 Shirley was my youngest son; the boy. 12 
He went into the tunnel. 13 My heart my mother 
my heart my mother 14 My heart my coming into 
being. 15 My husband is not able to work. 16 
He has it, according to the doctor. 17 We have 
been having a very hard time making a living since 
18 this trouble came to us. 19 I saw the 
dust in the bottom of the tub. 20 The boy 
worked there about eighteen months, 21 came home one evening 
with a shortness of breath. 22 He said, "Mother, I 
cannot get my breath." 23 Shirley was sick about three 
months. 24 I would carry him from his bed to 
the table, 25 from his bed to the porch, in 
my arms. 26 My heart is mine in the place 
of hearts, 27 They gave me back my heart, it 
lies in me. 28 When they took sick, right at 
the start, I saw a doctor. 29 I tried to 
get Dr. Harless to X-ray the boys. 30 He was 
the only man I had any confidence in, 31 the 
company doctor in the Kopper's mine, 32 but he would 
not see Shirley. 33 He did not know where his 
money was coming from. 34 I promised him half if 
he'd work to get compensation, 35 but even then he 
would not do anything. 36 I went on the road 
and begged the X-ray money, 37 the Charleston hospital made 
the lung pictures, 38 he took the case after the 
pictures were made. 39 And two or three doctors said 
the same thing. 40 The youngest boy did not get 
to go down there with me, 41 he lay and 
said, "Mother, when I die, 42 "I want you to 
have them open me up and 43 "see if that 
dust killed me. 44 "Try to get compensation, 45 "you 
will not have any way of making your living 46 
"when we are gone, 47 "and the rest are going 
too." 48 I have gained mastery over my heart 49 
I have gained mastery over my two hands 50 I 
have gained mastery over the waters 51 I have gained 
mastery over the river. 52 The case of my son 
was the first of the line of lawsuits. 53 They 
sent the lawyers down and the doctors down; 54 they 
closed the electric sockets in the camps. 55 There was 
Shirley, and Cecil, Jeffrey and Oren, 56 Raymond Johnson, Clev 
and Oscar Anders, 57 Frank Lynch, Henry Palf, Mr. Pitch, 
a foreman; 58 a slim fellow who carried steel with 
my boys, 59 his name was Darnell, I believe. There 
were many others, 60 the towns of Glen Ferris, Alloy, 
where the white rock lies, 61 six miles away; Vanetta, 
Gauley Bridge, 62 Gamoca, Lockwood, the gullies, 63 the whole 
valley is witness. 64 I hitchhike eighteen miles, they make 
checks out. 65 They asked me how I keep the 
cow on $2. 66 I said one week, feed for 
the cow, one week, the children's 67 flour. 68 The 
oldest son was twenty-three. 69 The next son was twenty-one. 
70 The youngest son was eighteen. 71 They called it 
pneumonia at first. 72 They would pronounce it fever. 73 
Shirley asked that we try to find out. 74 That's 
how they learned what the trouble was. 75 I open 
out a way, they have covered my sky with crystal 
76 I come forth by day, I am born a 
second time, 77 I force a way through, and I 
know the gate 78 I shall journey over the earth 
among the living. 79 He shall not be diminished, never; 
80 I shall give a mouth to my son.
