1 It is the poem, yes 2 that it exist 
that it grow in reach 3 that it grow into 
lives not yet born not yet speaking. 4 That its 
sounds move with the grace of meaning 5 the liquid 
sharing, the abrupt clash of lives. 6 That its suggestions 
climb to 7 descend to the fire of finding 8 
the last breath of the poem 9 and further. 10 
For that I move through states of being, 11 the 
struggle to wake, the frightful morning, 12 the flash of 
ecstasy among our mutilations, 13 the recognizing light shining and 
all night long 14 am invited led whipped dragged through 
states of being 15 toward the 16 inviting you through 
states of being 17 poem.
