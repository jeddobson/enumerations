1 Lately having escaped three-kinded death 2 Not by evasion 
but by coming through 3 I celebrate what may be 
true beginning. 4 But new begun am most without resource 
5 Stupid and stopped. How do the newborn grow? 6 
I am of them. Freshness has taken our hearts; 7 
Pain strips us to the source, infants of further life 
8 Waiting for childhood as we wait for form. 9 
So came I into the world of all the living 
10 The maimed triumphant middle of my way 11 Where 
there is giving needing no forgiving. 12 Saw now the 
present that is here to say: 13 Nothing I wrote 
is what I must see written, 14 Nothing I did 
is what I now need done.--- 15 The smile of 
darkness on my song and my son. 16 Lately emerged 
I have seen unfounded houses, 17 Have seen spirits not 
opened, surrounded as by sun, 18 And have, among limitless 
consensual faces 19 Watched all things change, an unbuilt house 
inherit 20 Materials of desire, that stone and wood and 
air. 21 Lit by a birth, I defend dark beginnings, 
22 Waste that is never waste, most-human giving, 23 Declared 
and clear as the mortal body of grace. 24 Beginnings 
of truth-in-life, the rooms of wilderness 25 Where truth feeds 
and the ramifying heart, 26 Even mine, praising even the 
past in its pieces, 27 My tearflesh beckoner who brought 
me to this place.
