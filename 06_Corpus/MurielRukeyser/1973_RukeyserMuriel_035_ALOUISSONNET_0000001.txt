For Louis Untermeyer, his eightieth birthday 1 The jokes, the 
feuds, the puns, the punishments, 2 This traditional man being 
brave, going in grace, 3 Finding the structure of lives 
more than perfected line; 4 The forms of poetry are 
his time and space. 5 He's quirky, he rhymes like 
daily life; light wine 6 Is all his flavor, till 
fierce reverence 7 Turns delicatessen into delicatesse --- 8 The 
man who anthologizes experience. 9 He is anthologized; like a 
wave of the sea 10 He is here, he is 
there, he changes; impossibly, 11 He is blue surface, green 
suspended, the dark deep notes. 12 A stain of brilliance 
spreading upward floats 13 In luminous air; we are luminous, 
he makes us be 14 The jokes of Job and 
Heine's anecdotes.
