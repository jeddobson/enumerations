1 Spirals and fugues, the power most like music 2 
Turneth all worlds to meaning 3 And meaning to matter, 
all continually, 4 And sweeps in the sacred motion, 5 
Spirals and fugues its lifetime, 6 To move my life 
to yours, 7 and all women and men and the 
children in their light, 8 The little stone in the 
middle of the road, its veins and 9 patience, 10 
Moving the constellations of all things.
