1 When I flew into Russia I said to my 
friend 2 Now I suppose I go into darkness. 3 
I was wrong. 4 I have been given every chance; 
5 Every question of mine has been answered. 6 I 
have seen in my own way. I have talked with 
the leaders 7 And with men and women on the 
assembly lines, on the farms, 8 and on streetcorners. 9 
I have come and gone, and asked questions, as I 
would at 10 home. 11 No man can understand this 
people without years of study 12 But there are facts 
we must know. 13 Here I have realized meanings: A 
people's war , 14 The Russian people, The resolve to 
destroy fascism. 15 The Russian people, in the fullest sense. 
16 Long and bitter winter ahead, every third person slaves 
at 17 home, 18 The farmland gone, the coal-land gone, 
the clothing nearly 19 gone. 20 No medicines. Five million 
people killed. Hurt. Gone. 21 The millions of women and 
the nine-year-olds 22 Running the farms and machines. 23 The 
Russian people chose victory or death. 24 They talk of 
the victory. 25 As I learn at first hand, I 
ask myself, What is the most effective 26 way we 
can help win the war by helping these heroic allies? 
27 ---A real second front, at the earliest the military 
leaders ... 28 And some may need public prodding. 29 
Next summer may be too late. 30 It is easy 
to sit in America in comfort. 31 They die by 
the thousands to hold Stalingrad. 32 If the Russian front 
is ours and Britain's, as it surely is, 33 Whoever 
dies tonight at Stalingrad 34 Dies for us, at our 
door. 35 The soldier is not impressed by the expert's 
term, "risk," 36 We can make. and make a bridge 
to Stalingrad, 37 We can help Russia with winter food, 
38 The hungry lions cannot fight. 39 We can, in 
this time, do two disparate things: 40 We can ease 
the pain and we can raid the cities. 41 Stop 
the suffering; a thousand plane raids.
