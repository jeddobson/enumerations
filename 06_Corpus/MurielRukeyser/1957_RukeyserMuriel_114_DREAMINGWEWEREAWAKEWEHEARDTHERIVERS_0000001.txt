1 Dreaming we were awake, we heard the rivers 2 
And seeing in sleep through the eye's meteor 3 A 
forest of light through which all rivers run 4 We 
ran, we ran upon the waves of stairs. 5 We 
juggled our entrances, losing our inner time, 6 And thought 
of the dead, who have entered the universe, 7 Running 
and running to the fading door. 8 The living will 
be giving us one song. 9 Congregation of sperm, in 
related music. 10 Sing down the legacy : Dominion solving 
hope! 11 O my own heart, forgive me, let me 
live.
