1 And a girl singing in the symbol air, crossing 
of gold, a 2 polished staff of music, 3 Intent 
as Wales, enormous violet. Then the edge lit cloud 4 
Balanced the steeple for a moment, while the high ritornel 
5 Sang slender in her throat, Light of light, God 
of God, 6 Sang all the lamps of sorrow, sang 
figurations of the swirling 7 Captives, their rare release. 8 
Sorrow has repetition, sang, but joy, but joy 9 Has 
continuity. 10 The fleeting furnace moon raising his white powers 
11 Will shiver alive tonight before that ritual face; 12 
Love with her graces and ways, open as peonies, 13 
Running with all the animals of heaven 14 In grass 
of green 15 Eternal orchards, until the soul of the 
boy says to the singer, 16 Gwyneth, you are my 
song. 17 Fifteen years to drift to the shore of 
this ocean, 18 Finding the wet and patterned sand, pillars 
and floor of fire. 19 All in the mercy of 
earth, the enlarging flower 20 That conquers death and sin, 
that sheds on the village 21 Of brick, fire, glass, 
tin and invented money 22 Incense and hungry bells. 23 
Ringing and hungering where the enormous ransomed boy 24 Now 
rings and hungers 25 In starved and golden air.
