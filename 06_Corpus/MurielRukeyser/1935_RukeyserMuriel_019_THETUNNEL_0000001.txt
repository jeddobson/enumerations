1 NO WORK is master of the mine today 2 
tyrant that walks with the feet of murder here 3 
under his cracked shoes a grass-blade dusted 4 dingy with 
coal's smear. 5 The father's hand is rubbed with dust, 
his body 6 is witness to coal, black glosses all 
his skin. 7 Around the pithead they stand and do 
not talk 8 looking at the obvious sign. 9 Behind 
his shoulder stands the black mountain 10 of unbought coal, 
green-topped with grass growing 11 rank in the shag, as 
if coal were native earth 12 and the top a 
green snowing 13 down on the countryside. In the whole 
valley 14 eleven mines, and five of them are closed, 
15 two are on strike, but in the others, workers 
16 scramble down the shafts, disposed 17 to grub all 
day and all night, lording it 18 in the town 
because of their jobs and their bosses 19 at work 
with all the other mines graveyards. 20 These are the 
valley's losses 21 which even the company fails to itemize 
22 in stubborn black and red in the company stores 
: 23 the empty breasts like rinds, the father's hands, 
24 the sign, the infected whores, 25 a puppy roasted 
for pregnant Mary's dinner ... 26 On the cold evenings 
the jobless miners meet 27 wandering dully attracted to the 
poolroom, 28 walking down the grey street. 29 "Well," says 
the father, "nothing comes of this, 30 the strippings run 
to weeds, the roads all mucked. 31 A dead mine 
makes dead miners. God, but I 32 was a fool 
not to have chucked 33 the whole damned ruin when 
I was a kid." 34 "And how'd you have a 
chance to throw it over?" 35 "Well," he said, "if 
I hadn't married : though then 36 the place had 
more in its favor. 37 Babies came quickly after summertimes. 
38 You could work, and quit, and get a better 
job. 39 God knows if it'll ever be the same, 
40 or if ever they'll think not to rob, 41 
not to cut wages, not to weigh us short." 42 
"All right," the other says, "maybe God does. 43 We'll 
be a long time dead, come that time, buried 44 
under coal where our life was; 45 we were children 
and did not know our childhood, 46 we got infants, 
and never knew our wives, 47 year in and out, 
seeing no color but coal, 48 we were the living 
who could not have their lives."49 Emerge, city, from your 
evening : allay me, sleep : 50 but the city 
withdraws to night, sleep passes whitely 51 inanely over my 
eyelids mockcomforting pale dawn's 52 developing silver and I unloved. 
53 Shall we no more, my love, pass down the 
lanes of grace 54 slowly together and in each other's 
safekeeping, no more 55 shall I watch evening touch hands 
to your face 56 and feel myself glisten in answer? 
57 Day shines a last gloom quickening the street, and 
deep 58 grave-deep the subway files down space to a 
moment 59 over me a plane exterminates distance ; you 
60 are unalterably removed : day touches you 61 nor 
night though tiger it may rage abroad ; you are 
62 beyond its claws, if my love will not reach 
you. 63 O love, how am I surpassed how mocked 
how 64 defiled and corroded untouched by your kiss. 65 
I came to you riding on love with love in 
my hands, advancing 66 seaworn, hearing far bells : you 
have been a prow 67 carving a tragic sea to 
meet my love, you have been lamps 68 burning all 
night over tired waters. 69 You have been stone set 
upon fine-grained woods, buildings 70 of granite standing in a 
street of stone, roads 71 full of fallen flowers wet 
under the foot, ships 72 pointing an index to voyage 
among islands, 73 blue archipelagoes : your body being an 
island 74 set about with magnetic flowers and flesh and 
fruit : 75 the sons I might bear you, the 
sons, the fragrant daughters. 76 Intrudes on this the bleak 
authentic voice : 77 wherefore does the mouth stiffen, the 
cheeks freeze austere 78 as stone, affording special grief among 
the days 79 and cold days catalogued of comfort murdered, 
80 the iron passage, estranged eyes, and the death 81 
of all my logic : pale with the weakness of 
one 82 dead and not yet arisen, a hollow bath 
of flame 83 with my fire low along the oils 
of grace 84 how many deaths, body so torn from 
spirit. 85 Body, return : I love you : soul, 
come home! 86 I am gone down to death in 
a great bleeding. 87 All day the bleeding washes down 
my sides ; at night 88 darkly and helplessly my 
face is wet. 89 Open me a refuge where I 
may be renewed. Speak to me 90 world hissing over 
cables, shining among steel strands, 91 plucking speech out on 
a wire, linking voices, 92 reach me now in my 
fierceness, or I am drowned 93 buried among my flesh, 
dead of a dead desire. 94 All night I went 
to the places of my love, 95 opened to one 
wished meeting, all unarmed. 96 And there was nothing but 
machine-loud streets. 97 All night I returned to the places 
of my love. 98 My love escaped me. May not 
the blood's frail drums 99 ever pulse healing in wrists 
and lips made known 100 whispering convalescence through a mist 
of sleep? 101 Let me approach infinity in love and 
sorrow, waiting 102 with the doubled strength of my own 
will and love, 103 burning with copper-spun electric fire, unconsumed, 
104 a bush upon a barren darkening plain. 105 My 
blood must be fed on foreign substance, lacking 106 the 
knowledge of those gestures, roots of words, unfeeling 107 the
