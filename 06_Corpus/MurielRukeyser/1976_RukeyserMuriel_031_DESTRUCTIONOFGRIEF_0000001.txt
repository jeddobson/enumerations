1 Today I asked Aileen 2 at the Film Library 
to help me find 3 those girl twins of the 
long-gone summer. 4 Aileen, who were they? 5 I was 
seven, the lion circus 6 was pitched in the field 
of sand and swordgrass 7 near the ocean, behind the 
Tackapoosha Garage. 8 The ancient land of the Waramaug Indians. 
9 Now there's a summer hotel. 10 The first day 
of that circus dazzles me forever. 11 I stayed. That 
evening 12 the police came looking for me. 13 Easy 
to find, behind 14 the bales of hay, with Caesar's 
tamer, 15 the clowns, and the girl twins. 16 My 
father and mother forgave me, for they loved 17 circuses, 
opera, carnivals, New York, popular songs. 18 All day that 
summer, all July and August, 19 I stayed behind the 
tents with the twin girls, 20 with Caesar the lion 
my friend, 21 with the lion-tamer. 22 Do you know 
their names, Aileen? 23 The girls went into the early 
movies. 24 Late August, Caesar mauled the man's right hand. 
25 I want to remember the names of those twins. 
26 You could see he would not ever keep his 
hand. 27 Smell of the ocean, straw, 28 lordly animal 
rankness, gunpowder. 29 "Yes, they destroyed Caesar," I was told 
that night. 30 Those twins became movie stars. 31 Those 
of us who were there that summer--- 32 Joey killed 
himself, I saw Tommy 33 just before the war; is 
Henry around? 34 Helene is in real estate---and the twins--- 
35 can you tell me their names, Aileen?
