1 Griefs 2 marking indelibly our later loves. 3 Fantastic 
juxtapose that sets the wish 4 opposite the insubordinate flesh 
5 interring the fact of the inconstant rain 6 in 
the fixed lightly-palpitant brain, 7 the anthropoid hunger laid against 
the will 8 making small music in the ventricle 9 
until evolved man hears with each breath-inake 10 the sweetly 
mathematical sound of Bach.11 Be bold, friend ; all your 
nymphs have disappeared 12 dwindled upon those green and classic 
banks, 13 the goddesses are gone, and the chivalric ranks. 
14 Where'er you walk, cool gales will fan the glade 
15 breathing themselves to death, sighing against the towers 16 
upon the firm and beautiful machines; 17 trees, where you 
sit, will crowd into a shade 18 eclipsing Handel, shining 
electric powers 19 of energy on polytechnic scenes. 20 Believe 
Eurydice unregained at last, 21 see that those idyll afternoons 
are past. 22 Accept the gathering skies that tell our 
morning, 23 open your hands open your thighs for strength 
24 inviolate in beauty, ill-defined 25 ready for the Columbus 
of the mind. 26 Trembling, the mouth relaxes in the 
kiss. 27 The lemon body and purple blood beneath 28 
award themselves in love, most perfect wreath.
