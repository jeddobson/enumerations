1 These are our brave, these with their hands in 
on the work, 2 hammering out beauty upon the painful 
stone 3 turning their grave heads passionately finding 4 truth 
and alone and each day subtly slain 5 and each 
day born. 6 Revolves 7 a measured system, world upon 
world, stemmed fires 8 and regulated galaxies behind the flattened 
head, 9 behind the immortal skull, ticking eternity 10 in 
blood and the symbols of living. 11 The brass voice 
speaks in the street 12 STRIKE STRIKE 13 the nervous 
fingers continue elaborately 14 drawing consciousness, examining, doing. 15 Rise 
to a billboard world of Chesterfields, 16 Mae West hip-wriggles, 
Tarzan prowess, the little 17 nibbling and despicable minds. 18 
Here, gentlemen, 19 here is our gallery of poets : 
20 Jeffers, 21 a long and tragic drum-roll beating anger, 
22 sick of a catapulting nightmare world, 23 Eliot, who 
led us to the precipice 24 subtly and perfectly ; 
there striking an attitude 25 rigid and ageing on the 
penultimate step, 26 the thoughtful man MacLeish who bent his 
head 27 feeling the weight of the living; bent, and 
turned 28 the grave important face round to the dead. 
29 And on your left, ladies and gentlemen : poets. 
30 Young poets and makers, solve your anguish, see 31 
the brave unmedalled, who dares to shape his mind, 32 
printed with dignity, to the machines of change. 33 A 
procession of poets adds one footbeat to the 34 implacable 
metric line : the great and unbetrayed 35 after the 
sunlight and the failing yellow, 36 after the lips bitten 
with passion and 37 gentle, after the deaths, below 38 
dance-floors of celebration we turn we turn 39 these braveries 
are permanent. These gifts 40 flare on our lives, clarifying, 
revealed. 41 We are too young to see our funerals 
42 in pantomime nightly before uneasy beds, 43 too near 
beginnings for this hesitation 44 obliterated in death or carnival. 
45 Deep into time extend the impersonal stairs, 46 established 
barricades will stand, 47 before they die the brave have 
set their hand 48 on rich particular beauty for their 
heirs.
