1 I lived in the first century of world wars. 
2 Most mornings I would be more or less insane, 
3 The newspapers would arrive with their careless stories, 4 
The news would pour out of various devices 5 Interrupted 
by attempts to sell products to the unseen. 6 I 
would call my friends on other devices; 7 They would 
be more or less mad for similar reasons. 8 Slowly 
I would get to pen and paper, 9 Make my 
poems for others unseen and unborn. 10 In the day 
I would be reminded of those men and women 11 
Brave, setting up signals across vast distances, 12 Considering a 
nameless way of living, of almost unimagined 13 values. 14 
As the lights darkened, as the lights of night brightened, 
15 We would try to imagine them, try to find 
each other. 16 To construct peace, to make love, to 
reconcile 17 Waking with sleeping, ourselves with each other, 18 
Ourselves with ourselves. We would try by any means 19 
To reach the limits of ourselves, to reach beyond ourselves, 
20 To let go the means, to wake. 21 I 
lived in the first century of these wars.
