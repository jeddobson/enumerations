1 I know that behind these walls is the city, 
over these rooftops 2 is the sun. 3 But I 
see black clothes only and white clothes with the fog 
4 running in 5 and all their shadows. 6 Every 
minute the sound of the harbor 7 intruding on horror 
with a bellow of horror: 8 blu-a! blu-aa! Ao.... 9 
I try to write to you, but here too I 
meet failure. 10 It has a face like mine. 11 
Silence and in me and over the water 12 only 
the bellowing, 13 Niobe howling for her life and her 
children. 14 Did you think this sorrow of women was 
a graceful thing? 15 Horrible Niobe down on her knees: 
16 Blu-a! Blu-aa! Ao.... 17 Thirty years, and my full 
strength, and all I touch has failed. 18 I sit 
and see 19 the black clothes on the line are 
beautiful, the sky drifting 20 away. 21 The white clothes 
of the fog beyond me, beautiful, and the 22 shadows. 
23 Blu-aa! Blu-aa! AO.
