1 The body cannot lie, but its betrayals, 2 narrower 
actions, cross even frontiers of night, 3 and your most 
delicate treason falls in a quick stroke, 4 undercuts sleep. 
5 Now, if I bodily sometime betrayed myself, 6 the 
foolish play's curtain drops on your active exposure, 7 grotesque 
as a peepshow, definite as the axe 8 in instant 
effect. 9 The toppling high tree lets fall its heavy 
side 10 green on the air, goes anyway down to 
ground 11 after a clap of weight resting---but we descend 
to 12 imperfect peace. 13 Here's war!---body betrayed, but all 
nerves still exerted 14 to rise up whole, grasp the 
perpetual sun. 15 Echo the shock, handclaps of fact composing 
16 a blackest pattern, 17 a tyrant pace to dance, 
clatter of anger 18 spanking the fury up to publish 
treason, 19 ranting and clapping madness; while the dim 20 
blood groans forever love.
