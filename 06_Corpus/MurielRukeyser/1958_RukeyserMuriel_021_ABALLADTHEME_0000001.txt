1 She tells: 2 Sing I chant I 3 To 
music in new morning heard 4 My need has become 
a bird 5 And is flown and is free 6 
My need grew stormy and wild 7 No love of 
mine had made a child 8 No song of mine 
had made my love 9 To plant my life 10 
Need grew deep about my heart. 11 They came then 
with their steely knives 12 They said Your song has 
many lives 13 Now choose you 14 They split my 
life while I did sleep 15 The joy of chance 
was in my dream 16 Loving and remembering 17 The 
nature of memory 18 Of the nature of time was 
all my dream 19 The nature of love and of 
forgetting 20 I dreamed the series of eternity 21 While 
I lay bleeding 22 The joy of choice I sing 
23 That out my wound did spring 24 My son 
and my song 25 Sing I chant I 26 Now 
the child is alive and young 27 And the child 
I among my veins 28 Sings and says with every 
breath 29 Sing I chant I
