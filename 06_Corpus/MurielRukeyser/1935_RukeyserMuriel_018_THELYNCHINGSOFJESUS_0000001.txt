1 Passage to godhead, fitfully glared upon 2 by bloody 
shinings over Calvary 3 this latest effort to revolution stabbed 
4 against a bitter crucificial tree, 5 mild thighs split 
by the spearwound, opening 6 in fierce gestation of immortality. 
7 Icarus' phoenix-flight fulfils itself, 8 desire's symbol swings full 
circle here, 9 eternal defeat by power, eternal death 10 
of the soul and body in murder or despair 11 
to be followed by eternal return, until 12 the thoughtful 
rebel may triumph everywhere. 13 Many murdered in war, crucified, 
starved, 14 loving their lives they are massacred and burned, 
15 hating their lives as they have found them, but 
16 killed while they look to enjoy what they have 
earned, 17 dismissed with peremptory words and hasty graves, 18 
little calm tributes of the unconcerned. 19 Bruno, Copernicus, Shelley, 
Karl Marx : you 20 makers of victory for us 
: how long? 21 We love our lives, and the 
crucifixions come, 22 benevolent bugles smother rebellion's song, 23 blowing 
protection for the acquiescent, 24 and we need many strengths 
to continue strong. 25 Tendons bind us to earth, Antaeus-ridden 
26 by desperate weakness disallied from ground, 27 bone of 
our bone; and the sky's plains above us 28 seduce 
us into powers still unfound, 29 and freedom's eagles scream 
above our faces, 30 misleading, sly, perverse, and unprofound. 31 
Passage to godhead, shine illuminated 32 by other colors than 
blood and fire and pride. 33 Given wings, we looked 
downward on earth, seen 34 uniform from distance; and descended, 
tied 35 to the much-loved near places, moved to find 
36 what numbers of lynched Jesuses have not been 37 
deified.38 Let us be introduced to our superiors, the voting 
men. 39 They are tired ; they are hungry ; 
from deciding all day 40 around the committee-table. 41 Is 
it foggy outside? It must be very foggy 42 The 
room is white with it. 43 The years slope into 
a series of flights, rocking sea-like, 44 shouting a black 
rush, enveloping time and kingdom 45 and the flab faces 
46 Those people engendered my blood swarming 47 over the 
altar to clasp the scrolls and Menorah 48 the black 
lips, bruised cheeks, eye-reproaches : 49 as the floor burns, 
singing Shema 50 Our little writers go about, hurrying the 
towns along, 51 running from mine to luncheon, they can't 
afford 52 to let one note escape their holy jottings 
: 53 today the mother died, festering : he shot 
himself : the 54 bullet entered 55 the roof of 
the mouth, piercing the brain-pan 56 How the spears went 
down in a flurry of blood; 57 how they died 
howling 58 how the triumph marched 59 all day and 
all night past the beleaguered town 60 blowing trumpets at 
the fallen towers; 61 how they pulled their shoulders over 
the hill, crying 62 for the whole regiment to hear 
The Sea The Sea 63 Our young men opening the 
eyes and mouths together, 64 facing the new world with 
their open mouths 65 gibbering war 66 gibbering conquest 67 
Ha. Will you lead us to discovery? 68 What did 
you do in school today, my darling? 69 Tamburlaine rode 
over Genghis had a sword 70 holding riot over Henry 
V Emperor of and 71 the city of Elizabeth the 
tall sails 72 crowding England into the world and Charles 
73 his head falling many times onto a dais 74 
how they have been monarchs and 75 Calvin Coolidge who 
wouldn't say 76 however, America 77 All day we have 
been seated around a table 78 all these many days 
79 One day we voted on whether he was Hamlet 
80 or whether he was himself and yesterday 81 I 
cast the deciding vote to renounce our mouths. 82 Today 
we sentinel the avenue solemnly warning 83 the passers (who 
look the other way, and cough) that we 84 speak 
with the mouths of demons, perhaps the people's, 85 but 
not our own. 86 Tomorrow 87 the vote's to be 
cast on the eyes, and sex, and brain. 88 Perhaps 
we will vote to disavow all three. 89 We are 
powerful now : we vote 90 death to Sacco a 
man's name 91 and Vanzetti a blood-brother; death 92 to 
Tom Mooney, or a wall, no matter; 93 poverty to 
Piers Plowman, shrieking anger 94 to Shelley, a cough and 
Fanny to Keats; 95 thus to Blake in a garden; 
thus to Whitman; 96 thus to D. H. Lawrence. 97 
And to all you women, 98 dead and unspoken-for, what 
sentences, 99 to you dead children, little in the ground 
100 : all you sweet generous rebels, what sentences 101 
This is the case of one Hilliard, a native of 
Texas, 102 in the year of our Lord 1897, a 
freeman. 103 Report . . . Hilliard's power of endurance 
seems to be 104 the most wonderful thing on record. 
His lower limbs 105 burned off a while before he 
became unconscious; 106 and his body looked to be burned 
to the hollow. 107 Was it decreed (oh coyly coyly) 
by an avenging God 108 as well as an avenging 
people that he suffer so? 109 We have 110 16 
large views under magnifying glass. 111 8 views of the 
trial and the burning. 112 For place of exhibit watch 
the street bills. 113 Don't fail to see this. 114 
Lie down dear, the day was long, the evening is 
smooth. 115 The day was long, and you were voting 
all day 116 hammering down these heads 117 tamping the 
mould about these diamond eyes 118 filling the mouths with 
wax 119 lie down my dear 120 the bed is 
soft lie down to kindest dreams 121 all night they 
carried leaves 122 bore songs and garlands up the gradual 
hill 123 the noise of singing kept the child awake 
124 but they were dead 125 all Shakespeare's heroes the
