1 Speeding from city, feeling day 2 grimmer and more 
opaque, 3 a thousand times more Death than night 4 
here on the pebbled roads, bled of all light and 
kind, 5 hastening darkness to the impatient mind, 6 we 
shook off nights our fever watched the street, 7 besieged 
by laughter from the outer room, 8 heard the pang, 
pang of bells bury our hope 9 for private warmth 
or time or bed or house 10 free from the 
failure public in that place. 11 Here was to be 
moment of proof, if any 12 conspiracy of night and 
speed and river 13 could lift us whole from danger, 
and make real 14 the veiny tree, the gleaming parallel 
15 of railroad tracks and water, using our trespass well 
16 to heal all breaches, prove our hope's disease 17 
curable by annealing, bandage night, 18 blank out the city's 
bricked-up doors, the glare 19 of the night-watchman's ray, No 
Trespassing, 20 Don't Walk Here, Stay At Your Window, Keep 
On Looking. 21 Reaching the full-grown field, danger slowed down, 
22 darkness enlarged around the blind, parked car. 23 No 
need to look; the brilliant fatal skim 24 of light 
swung over the acre, striking the night-proof dead, 25 the 
Caretaker's flashlight sending his shadow up ahead.
