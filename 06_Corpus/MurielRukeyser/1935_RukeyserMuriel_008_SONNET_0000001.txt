1 My thoughts through yours refracted into speech 2 transmute 
this room musically tonight, 3 the notes of contact flowing, 
rhythmic, bright 4 with an informal art beyond my single 
reach. 5 Outside, dark birds fly in a greening time 
: 6 wings of our sistered wishes beat these walls 
: 7 and words afflict our minds in near footfalls 
8 approaching with a latening hour's chime. 9 And if 
an essential thing has flown between us, 10 rare intellectual 
bird of communication, 11 let us seize it quickly : 
let our preference 12 choose it instead of softer things 
to screen us 13 each from the other's self : 
muteness or hesitation, 14 nor petrify live miracle by our 
indifference.
