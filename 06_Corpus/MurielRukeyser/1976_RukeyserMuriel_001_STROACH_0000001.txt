1 For that I never knew you, I only learned 
to dread you, 2 for that I never touched you, 
they told me you are filth, 3 they showed me 
by every action to despise your kind; 4 for that 
I saw my people making war on you, 5 I 
could not tell you apart, one from another, 6 for 
that in childhood I lived in places clear of you, 
7 for that all the people I knew met you 
by 8 crushing you, stamping you to death, they poured 
boiling 9 water on you, they flushed you down, 10 
for that I could not tell one from another 11 
only that you were dark, fast on your feet, and 
slender. 12 Not like me. 13 For that I did 
not know your poems 14 And that I do not 
know any of your sayings 15 And that I cannot 
speak or read your language 16 And that I do 
not sing your songs 17 And that I do not 
teach our children 18 to eat your food 19 or 
know your poems 20 or sing your songs 21 But 
that we say you are filthing our food 22 But 
that we know you not at all. 23 Yesterday I 
looked at one of you for the first time. 24 
You were lighter than the others in color, that was 
neither good nor bad. 25 I was really looking for 
the first time. 26 You seemed troubled and witty. 27 
Today I touched one of you for the first time. 
28 You were startled, you ran, you fled away 29 
Fast as a dancer, light, strange and lovely to the 
touch. 30 I reach, I touch, I begin to know 
you.
