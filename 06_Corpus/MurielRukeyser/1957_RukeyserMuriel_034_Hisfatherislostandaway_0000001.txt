His father is lost and away. Paul never asks for 
help or sympathy. He is detached and proud. Now, around 
New Year's Day, he stops being Paul. The brittle four-year-old 
turns into something else: the farthest he can imagine, the 
oldest he can travel. He announces to everyone that he 
is Timmy Torin, he is nine and can do anything. 
He is his own hero. And his father is lost.
