1 Lucid at dusk the city lies revealed 2 authentic 
purpose under masonry 3 emerging into emphasis. Tenuous 4 the 
bodies grim at noon lie scattered, limp 5 on the 
beach of evening, and the long sea 6 of night 
softly encroaches on reality. 7 Pale the primitive blue of 
afternoon, 8 morning's bravado made ambiguous, 9 and all the 
bulwarks we relied upon 10 relapsed to fluid concept. Now 
the night 11 opens a shady empire odorous 12 prodigal 
in sweetness, sweetly promiscuous. 13 Foliate evening opens in a 
blur 14 of even color on the risen stone : 
15 in unified unbroken shoulderings 16 of tower past planned 
tower, twilight-softened; 17 insanest noise resolves to monotone. 18 The 
theory of the city's fact made known 19 in a 
revelatory evening stillness. 20 Traffic and work and riot, triad 
of waking 21 are garbled into a full chord, drowning 
22 identity in conquering vibration 23 impinging on the air, 
loud, rising, making 24 the city conscious of propellers shaking 
25 hard frames of aircraft ; night cloven by twin 
wings, 26 incisive angles ripping evening where 27 blueness was 
closing deepest to the north 28 beyond the Bridge, beyond 
the island, planes : 29 a burr of dissonance, a 
swoop of bare 30 fatal battalions black against the air. 
31 Time is metric now with the regular advance : 
descend the skytrack 32 signal-red on the wingtips, defined by 
a glitter of bulbs ; 33 we lean at the 
windows or roofrails, attentive 34 under inverted amphitheatre of sky. 
35 The river is keen under blackness, weapon-malevolent, 36 crossed 
jagged marks mirrored against its steel. 37 Suddenly from a 
trance of speed are let fall bubbles slowly 38 blooming 
in pale light, but hardening to crystal 39 glows, into 
calcium brilliance, white bombs floating 40 imperturbable 41 along the 
planes of the air, in chains of burning, destruction in 
42 the wake 43 of the beautiful transition. City, shimmer 
in amusement, 44 spectators at the mocking of your bombardment. 
45 City, cry out : the space is full of 
planes, you will be heard, 46 the thin shark-bodies are 
concentrated to listen, 47 without a sound but the clean 
strength of the engines, dripping 48 death-globes drifting down the 
wind 49 lifted by parachutes in a metaphor of death, 
50 the symbol not the substance, merest detail of fact, 
going down 51 the wincing illuminated river, fading over the 
city. 52 Planes weave : the children laugh at the 
fireworks : "Oh, 53 pretty stars! 54 Oh, see the 
white!" 55 Planes move in a calculated dance of war 
56 each throwing, climax to superbest flight. 57 No whisper 
rises from the city : New York is quiet 58 
as a doped man walking to the electric chair, fixed 
in memory, 59 suspended in an image of peace. Skeins 
of light 60 are woven above the city, gathering-in evening 
in a harvest of 61 peace, 62 from loveliest vessels 
falling, the buds of annihilation. 63 Turn and re-turn in 
precise advance, engines of power 64 subtle terrific potency, rays 
of destruction emitted from black suns 65 shining the faces 
of burial, loosing magnificence 66 in bombs, in a sardonic 
joke play games of death, 67 cancel the city to 
an achievement : zero. 68 Pregnant zero breeding annihilation . 
. . . 69 futility stands clear on these horizons 
70 marked in the zeros of a thousand clouds 71 
pregnant above a harvested land, whose fruit 72 was peace 
infected with the germs of war. 73 In tragic streaks 
the planes' formations fly 74 across the black pavilions of 
the sky. 75 Failure encompassed in success, the warplanes 76 
dropping flares, as a historic sum of knowledge, 77 tallying 
Icarus loving the sun, and plunging, 78 Leonardo engraved on 
the Florentine pale evening 79 scheming toward wings, as toward 
an alchemy 80 transferring life to golden circumstance. 81 Following 
him, the warplanes travelling home, 82 flying over the cities, 
over the minds 83 of cities rising against imminent doom. 
84 Icarus' passion, Da Vinci's skill, corrupt, 85 all rotted 
into war : 86 Between murmur and murmur, birth and 
death, 87 is the earth's turning which follows the earth's 
turning, 88 a swift whisper of life, an ambiguous word 
spoken; 89 morning travelling quiet on mutinous fields, 90 muscles 
swollen tight in giant effort ; rain ; some stars 
; 91 a propeller's glimpsing silver whirl, intensely upward, 92 
intensely forward, bearing the plane : flying. 93 Believe that 
we bloom upon this stalk of time ; 94 and 
in this expansion, time too grows for us 95 richer 
and richer towards infinity. 96 They promised us the gold 
and harps and seraphs. 97 Our rising and going to 
sleep is better than future pinions. 98 We surrender that 
hope, drawing our own days in, 99 covering space and 
time draped in tornadoes, 100 lightning invention, speed crushing the 
stars upon us, 101 stretching the accordion of our lives, 
sounding the same chord 102 longer and savoring it until 
the echo fails. 103 Believe that your presences are strong, 
104 O be convinced without formula or rhyme 105 or 
any dogma ; use yourselves : be : fly. 106 
Believe that we bloom upon this stalk of time.
