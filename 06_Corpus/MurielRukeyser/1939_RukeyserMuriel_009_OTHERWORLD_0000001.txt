1 This is the dream-journal, knowing the earth slips under, 
2 not knowing how the sea offers to ships 3 
another sliding line. This is the otherworld 4 slipping among 
innumerable nets. 5 Color and love of land, the water-barrier 
spills 6 sleep on the gulls' waves, a sketch of 
ocean 7 like children's crayon-drawings, the long North 8 Sea 
fanged by icebergs, green and clanging hills. 9 This was 
the journey. Out of adolescence. 10 Past Anticosti, Labrador, past 
Belle Isle, 11 end of America. And islands come; 12 
after the ocean, the seabird's complex eye. 13 Ship's wake 
at stern, the after-life. 14 And pass the Hebrides asleep. 
15 Islands identified. Lighthouse and channel-blue 16 all day, pure 
Irish fields, a female sea. 17 Always ahead, new air. 
Falling behind 18 wide Firth, the lights of Greenock bank 
the Clyde. 19 Ayr, Arran, Ailsa Craig the single rock; 
20 the Isle of Man points water-level Wales. 21 Coming 
among the living where we rise, 22 coming among the 
dead in whom we wade 23 kneedeep and undermined; through 
seas to the great island 24 promising continents, the riding 
shores arrive. 25 That was the wanted voyage of a 
child with maps, 26 an adolescent at books and hearsay 
of lovers 27 telling desires dead with the end in 
sight. 28 I think now of that port, England ahead, 
29 my clumsy porthole stare at landing-light. 30 I blessed 
my luck my landing could be loved. 31 Blessing my 
end-luck in this room again 32 steadily, for the first 
time steady. Watch 33 light, lying still, too awkward deep 
in joy. 34 All sliding globe-lines on the sea forgotten 
35 and taken into shore where ships lose skill 36 
after fierce water come to blessed end.37 Land; and only 
to stand on the ground, stand on the brick of 
38 the dark-red city, stand on the car-crowded dock 39 
with the city beating up at the face, and the 
harbor-land beating 40 up at the feet, beating 41 its 
stony flatness after sea, with its strange tongues, strange 42 
turns of the head, strange 43 biddings, strange bracing, strange 
binding! but the car enters 44 the tiled tunnel into 
the 45 turnings through summer country, among hills stippled with 
46 gardens, the shade-park forests 47 freaked with sunlight, the 
Shropshire hedges, the trenchings of 48 lanes, the grassy 49 
fallen shore-smooth places where this floor of island is a 
50 mowed fishpond, the deep 51 grass, the stamping grass 
and parsley, marigold leaves and 52 daisies, 53 the car 
run through a narrow bridge of speed winding the 54 
curving the standing shadows, 55 along the trellised stream, along 
the earth-wet-smelling cloisters 56 stopped by cascades from a loosely 
practised piano in Chester 57 shaking its scales loose over 
the city crowded with speech, the 58 window where Herbert 
59 and martyred Charles and Lancelot Andrews are gone in 
their 60 trance, in their triptych 61 of color to 
Chester's heaven, less vivid burning than blue- 62 burning glass--- 
63 and the fields, and gooseberry lawns, and the ribbons 
of music 64 broadcast identical 65 over the roads, threading 
the shadows, thinned by the quick 66 and ranging 67 
eye of the sun who takes this fief with all 
lands captive daily, 68 gathering the ripple of 69 speed 
and our knees before us and the car's leaning and 
the 70 enamelled tree 71 whose flame is grassland and 
the tree a fire, sun-shadow, 72 blocking 73 out black-caked 
industries, chimneys of blackened cities, hills, 74 hollow streets 75 
weighing down this driftless, this island, its scarps, its 76 
talismanic hills, 77 its wet-grass-wading counties, ocean-eye out, its moist 
color, 78 its leaping 79 thought lifted to down-dipping suns, 
standing shadows of the 80 barrow-buried race, 81 tombstones set 
out to pasture in fat grass---and the fashion 82 whose 
pulses match ours, an atrophied prince, a flier's career, 83 
the pathic gunman, the gangster mayor, the voice of a 
mouse--- 84 and the profile of cities, 85 the cities, 
the old road through Roman cities, approaching the 86 central 
city, the nave of horrible empire, 87 the proud, the 
evening-bold---over the last rolled cloudbanks, 88 in a spume of 
light, we speed to, 89 curve to past distal cities. 
Starfall begins with the miracle over 90 the hill. 91 
And flat on this land the march, farm-foot, barn-foot, field- 
92 foot, 93 silent march on the London streets, come 
far : with slogans : 94 and slowly, 95 the 
tithe-march moves, the farmers lift their flags : their faces 
96 break 97 the crust of nations once more, and 
farm-foot, barn-foot, field- 98 foot, 99 pace London : their 
banners Invictus say We Will Not Be 100 Druv: shoutless 
101 move past the eyes of the stones, the guards, 
the horses, the 102 houses 103 where the colonel with 
the undershot jaw sees the actress with 104 the bulletproof 
face 105 see the cabman see the diplomat see the 
salesman see the 106 colonial 107 rheumatic sub-secretary see cathedrals 
see the tourists 108 see the street see the marches 
see the silence see the island 109 see the island 
see the island see the faces of the sky.110 Coming 
among the living 111 at railway stations at the porter's 
smile 112 train for the south alone in the brisk 
winds 113 a rumor of nothing at all among the 
forest 114 coming among the dead 115 at Dover, a 
pebbled ridge of the known world 116 or water or 
the buffeting sight of that chalk forehead 117 a cloud 
over that head 118 tall over land 119 and feeling 
earth slip under 120 standing among innumerable nets 121 or 
Calais the rapid speech the warm hearth-colored brick 122 silver 
of trees the wheels in silver laid 123 Paris the 
fluent city running by like film 124 in landmarks of 
travelogues, the straddled tower, 125 the arch framing a gas-mask
