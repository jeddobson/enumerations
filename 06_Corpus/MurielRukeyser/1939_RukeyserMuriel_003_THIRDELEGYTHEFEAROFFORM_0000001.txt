1 Tyranny of method! the outrageous smile 2 seals the 
museums, pours a mob skidding 3 up to the formal 
staircase, stopped, mouths open. 4 And do they stare? They 
do. 5 At what? A sunset? 6 Blackness, obscurity, bravado 
were the three colors; 7 wit-play, movement, and wartime the 
three moments; 8 formal groups, fire, facility, the three hounds. 
9 This was their art: a wall daubed like a 
face, 10 a penis or finger dipped in a red 
pigment. 11 The sentimental frown gave them their praise, 12 
prized the wry color, the twisted definition, 13 and said, 
"You are right to copy." 14 But the car full 
of Communists put out hands and guns, 15 blew 1-2-3 
on the horn before the 16 surrealist house, a spiral 
in Catalu√±a. 17 New combinations: set out materials now, 18 
combine them again! the existence is the test. 19 What 
do you want? Lincoln blacking his lessons 20 in charcoal 
on an Indiana shovel? 21 or the dilettante, the impresario's 
beautiful skull 22 choosing the tulip crimson satin, the yellow 
satin 23 as the ballet dances its tenth time to 
the mirror? 24 Or the general's nephew, epaulets from birth, 
25 run down the concourse, shouting Planes for Spain? 26 
New methods, the staring circle given again 27 force, a 
phoenix of power, another Ancient 28 sits in his circle, 
while the plaster model 29 of an equation slowly rotates 
beneath him, 30 and all his golden compass leans. 31 
Create an anti-sentimental: Sing! 32 "For children's art is not 
asylum art, 33 "there are these formal plays in living, 
for 34 "the equal triangle does not spell youth, 35 
"the cube nor age, the sphere nor ever soul. 36 
"Asylum art is never children's art. 37 "They cut the 
bones down, but the line remained. 38 "They cut the 
line for good, and reached the point 39 "blazing at 
the bottom of its night." 40 A man is walking, 
wearing the world, swearing 41 saying You damn fools come 
out into the open. 42 Whose dislocated wish? Whose terrors 
whine? 43 I'll fuse him straight. 44 The usable present 
starts my calendar. 45 Chorus of bootblacks, printers, collectors of 
shit. 46 Your witwork works, your artwork shatters, die. 47 
Hammer up your abstractions. Divide, O zoo. 48 ---He's a 
queer bird, a hero, a kangaroo. 49 What is he 
going to do? 50 He calls Rise out of cities, 
you memorable ghosts 51 scraps of an age whose choice 
is seen 52 to lie between evils. Dazzle-paint the rest, 
53 it burns my eyes with its acetylene. 54 Look 
through the wounds, mystic and human fly, 55 you spiritual 
unicorn, you clew of eyes. 56 Ghosts to approach the 
blood in fifteen cities. 57 Did you walk through the 
walls of the Comtesse de Noailles? 58 Was there a 
horror in Chicago? 59 Or ocean? Or ditches at the 
road. Or France, 60 while bearing guarding shadowing painting in 
Paris, 61 Picasso like an ass Picasso like a dragon 
Picasso like a 62 romantic movement 63 and immediately after, 
stations of swastikas 64 Prague and a thousand boys swing 
circles clean 65 girls by the thousand curve their arms 
together 66 geometries of wire 67 the barbed, starred 68 
Heil 69 Will you have capitals with their tarnished countesses 
70 their varnished cemetery life 71 vanished Picassos 72 or 
clean acceptable Copenhagen 73 or by God a pure high 
monument 74 white yellow and red 75 up against Minnesota? 
76 Does the sea permit its dead to wear jewels? 
77 Flame, fusion, defiance are your three guards, 78 the 
sphere, the circle, the cluster your three guides, 79 the 
bare, the blond and the bland are your three goads. 
80 Adam, Godfinger, only these contacts function: 81 light and 
the high accompanied design, 82 contact of points the fusion 
say of sex 83 the atombuster too along these laws. 
84 Put in a sphere, here, at the focal joint, 
85 he said, put it in. The moment is arrangement. 
86 Currents washed through it, spun, blew white, 87 fused. 
For! the sphere! proving! 88 This was the nightmare of 
a room alone, 89 the posture of grave figure, finger 
on other head, 90 he puts the finger of power 
on him, 91 optic of grandiose delusion. 92 All you 
adjacent and contagious points, 93 make room for fusion; fall, 
94 you monuments, snow on your heads, 95 your power, 
your pockets, your dead parts. 96 Standing at midnight corners 
under corner-lamps 97 we wear the coat and the shadow 
of the coat. 98 The mind sailing over a scene 
lets light arrive 99 conspicuous sunrise, the knotted smoke rising, 
100 the world with all its signatures visible. 101 Play 
of materials in balance, 102 carrying the strain of a 
new process. 103 Of the white root, the nature of 
the base, 104 contacts, making an index. 105 And do 
they stare? They do. 106 Our needs, our violences. 107 
At what? Contortion of body and spirit. 108 To fuse 
it straight.
