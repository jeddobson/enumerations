1 He breaks as the river knots about their knees: 
2 I thought I could bring life to such a 
pitch 3 That you and I and all things might 
be seen 4 With our own fire burning. Something like 
Eden. 5 She is water to the thighs. Relinquishing daylight, 
cries, 6 Where four rivers meet! 7 I like Eden 
our parents alive and corruptless, 8 Our parents thirteen years 
old, each one his own, 9 Slenderer than time, meeting 
in their first powers 10 And making us again. 11 
Now her voice twirls past domes and nebulas, 12 The 
tilted courtroom sailing by as columns. 13 All stars, all 
cities variable. 14 And sondes and angels, swimming 15 Flood 
at his throat. 16 He knows something is safe. The 
whirlpool, 17 He says, the embryo. 18 Before him floating 
and grave 19 The face of a child within the 
water-spiral. 20 A thin boy carrying a growing shoot. 21 
Image of the continual self he shines 22 The edgewise 
spiral of all the hourlines. 23 Because you do require, 
the child is saying. 24 These are the bonds among 
things; they are the spirit 25 When you do recognize. 
26 Even when all the voices are denied.
