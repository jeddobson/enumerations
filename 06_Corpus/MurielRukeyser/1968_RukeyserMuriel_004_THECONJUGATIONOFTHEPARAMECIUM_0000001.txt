4 The species 5 is continued 6 as so many 
are 7 (among the smaller creatures) 8 by fission 9 
(and this species 10 is very small 11 next in 
order to 12 the amoeba, the beginning one) 13 The 
paramecium 14 achieves, then, 15 immortality 16 by dividing 17 
But when 18 the paramecium 19 desires renewal 20 strength 
another joy 21 this is what 22 the paramecium does: 
23 The paramecium 24 lies down beside 25 another 26 
paramecium 27 Slowly inexplicably 28 the exchange 29 takes place 
30 in which 31 some bits 32 of the nucleus 
of each 33 are exchanged 34 for some bits 35 
of the nucleus 36 of the other 37 This called 
38 the conjugation of the paramecium.
