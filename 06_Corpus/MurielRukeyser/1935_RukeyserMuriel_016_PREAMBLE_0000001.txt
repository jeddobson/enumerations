1 Earth, bind us close, and time ; nor, sky, 
deride 2 how violate we experiment again. 3 In many 
Januaries, many lips 4 have fastened on us while we 
deified 5 the waning flesh : now, fountain, spout for 
us, 6 mother, bear children : lover, yet once more 
: 7 in final effort toward your mastery. 8 Many 
Decembers suffered their eclipse 9 death, and forgetfulness, and the 
year bore round ; 10 now years, be summed in 
one access of power. 11 Fortresses, strengths, beauties, realities, 12 
gather together, discover to us our wings 13 new special 
product of mortality. 14 Fortuitously have we gained loneliness, 15 
fallen in waste places liberated, 16 relieved ourselves from weakness' 
loveliness : 17 remain unpitied now, never descend 18 to 
that soft howling of the prostrate mind. 19 Cut with 
your certain wings; engrave space now 20 to your ambition 
: stake off sky's dimensions. 21 We have plunged on 
nightmares to destruction 22 too long; and learned aggression divides 
wind, 23 pale early Venus is signature of night 24 
and wish gnawed clean by plans precurses flight. 25 Distinguish 
the metaphor most chromium clear 26 for distant calendars to 
identify : 27 Frail mouthings will fall diminished on old 
ears 28 in dusty whispers, light from extinctest stars 29 
will let us sleep, nor may we replica 30 ourselves 
in hieroglyphs and broken things 31 but there is reproduction 
for this act 32 linking the flight's escape with strict 
contact. 33 Look! Be : leap; 34 paint trees in 
flame 35 bushes burning 36 roar in the broad sky 
37 know your color : be : 38 produce that 
the widenesses 39 be full and burst their wombs 40 
riot in redness, delirious with light, 41 swim bluely through 
the mind 42 shout green as the day breaks 43 
put up your face to the wind 44 FLY 45 
chant as the tomtom hubbubs crash 46 elephants in the 
flesh's jungle 47 reek with vigor sweat pour your life 
48 in a libation to itself 49 drink from the 
ripe ground 50 make children over the world 51 lust 
in a heat of tropic orange 52 stamp and writhe 
; stamp on a wet floor 53 know earth know 
water know lovers 54 know mastery 55 FLY 56 Walks 
down the street 57 Kaleidoscope a man 58 where patterns 
meet 59 his mind colored 60 with mirage 61 Leonardo's 
tomb 62 not in Italian earth 63 but in a 
fuselage 64 designed 65 in the historic mind 66 time's 
instrument 67 blue-print of birth. 68 We know sky overhead, 
earth to be stepped 69 black under the toes, rubble 
between our fingers, 70 horizons are familiar ; we have 
been taught colors. 71 Rehearse these ; sky, earth, and 
their meeting-place, 72 confound them in a blur of distance, 
swallow 73 the blueness of guessed-at places, merge them now. 
74 Sky being meeting of sky and no-sky 75 including 
our sources the earth water air 76 fire to weld 
them : unity in knowing 77 all space in one 
unpunctuated flowing. 78 Flight, thus, is meeting of flight and 
non-flight. 79 We bear the seeds of our return forever, 
80 the flowers of our leaving, fruit of flight, 81 
perfect for present, fertile for its roots 82 in past 
in future in motility.
