the gout, and being 320 A little sober in the 
morning 321 I raised in the garden a Temple of 
Reason 322 For my own funeral, 323 Furnished with pipes 
and tobacco, a speaking trumpet 324 And fireworks in the 
tomb, 325 A Bible to read, and some good songs. 
326 I sent out invitations. 327 Now it was time 
to begin. 15 328 It was a fine clear day, 
329 I had fine pallbearers 330 Lord East Lord West 
Lord North and Lord South 331 Lord Megul and Lord 
Shambow. 332 The minister made his prayer--- 333 Doctor Strong, 
he was--- 334 And the flimsy sextons were there 335 
And very much crying. 336 About 3000 came, 337 Oh, 
half the town, I'd say. 338 The procession wound 16 
339 Under my window 340 Across the garden to my 
341 Temple of Reason. 342 My coffin was long ready, 
343 Painted in my house. 344 White lead inside 345 
And outside touched with green. 346 Noble trimmings, eight handles 
347 And an uncommon lock. 348 Now it was put 
into the 349 Temple of Reason. 350 Out in the 
kitchen I was 351 Beating my wife; 352 The ghostly 
lady 353 Had hardly mourned at all. 354 Very few 
people 355 Should attend funerals. 356 Many catch cold, and 
we 357 Want to settle Ohio; 358 We can't spare 
these beauties 359 To die so soon.360 Ghostly in my 
house 361 A woman I married--- 362 Ghostly up the 
stairs, 363 Like snow in the hall. 364 At midnight 
in her bed 365 The ghostly-breasted; 366 I cannot have 
her ghost 367 Walking my palace. 17 368 They say 
she is alive. 369 I say she will ever be 
370 Mrs. Dexter that was. 371 The attacks of the 
ghost 372 Will not let me sleep.--- 373 Now to 
save my life. 374 I will sell the house, 375 
Horses, the cream-color horses 376 And the coach. 377 If 
not I will let it. 378 Wait. I can sweep 
my house 379 And get all anew 18 380 And 
go out of hell. 381 I will advertise. 382 "A 
very colding wife 383 Is poison to me. 384 I 
wish to be still 385 And master of my cash; 
386 And therefore I wish for 387 One very good 
housekeeper. 388 Them that know me know 389 The kind 
of woman. 390 Now I will say 391 What kind 
of a person, 392 From thirty to forty 393 And 
a good jade 394 That will trot pace and gallop--- 
395 Not to heave one off 396 But, rather of 
the two, 397 Heave on.---I mean right well. 398 Now 
stop, I got off the path; 399 Now I am 
honest: I wish for 400 A middling woman for size, 
401 Sensible honest and comely, 402 Knowing when to speak 
403 And when to be silent, 404 With a nose 
like mine."360 Ghostly in my house 361 A woman I 
married--- 362 Ghostly up the stairs, 363 Like snow in

a coastwise dance 406 Among the ills of ocean, in 
pauper light 407 Imagining truth, at dawn turning from madness 
408 Into the unknown world, up blue invisible 409 Mountains 
of fantasy climbing 410 To the sea. 411 Where he 
as a boy walked down, salty, in brightness 412 Raging 
and worshipping. 413 Their faces turn again the nailhead stare 
414 Of proverbs glaring at the intuitive. 415 My old 
head has 416 Worn out three bodies. 417 Amen. Clean 
truth. 418 Pay the whole debt, it will make nations
