1 The woman to the man : 2 What is 
that on your hands? 3 It is also on my 
hands. 4 What is that in your eyes? 5 You 
see it in my eyes, do you? 6 Is your 
sex intact? Is mine? 7 Can it be about life 
now? 8 You went out to war. 9 War came 
over our house. 10 Our bed is not the same. 
11 We will set about beginnings. 12 I kiss your 
hands, I kiss your eyes, 13 I kiss your sex. 
14 I will kiss, I will bless 15 all the 
beginnings.
