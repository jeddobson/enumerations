1 Clouds, airs, carried me away, 2 but here we 
stand 3 and newborn we begin. 4 Having seen all 
the people of the play, 5 the lights, the map 
in the hand. 6 we know there will be wars 
7 all acted out, and know not who may win. 
8 Deep now in your great eyes, and in my 
gross 9 flesh --- heavy as ever, woman of mud--- 
10 shine sunset, sunrise and the advancing stars. 11 But 
past all loss 12 and all forbidding a thing is 
understood. 13 Orpheus in hell remembered rivers 14 and a 
music rose 15 full of all human voices; 16 all 
words you wish are in that living sound. 17 And 
even torn to pieces 18 one piece sang 19 Come 
all ye torn and wounded here 20 together 21 and 
one sang to its brother 22 remembering. 23 One piece 
in tatters sang among its blood: 24 man is a 
weapon, woman's a trap; 25 and so is the hand 
with the map, my dear, 26 so is the hand 
with the colored map. 27 And I to myself the 
tightest trap. 28 Now all is young again: 29 in 
a wet night among the household music, 30 the new 
time, 31 by miracle my traps are sprung. 32 I 
wished you all your good again 33 and all your 
good is here with you, 34 smiling, various, and true, 
35 your living friends, as live as we. 36 I 
believed because I saw not; 37 now I see, 38 
with love become 39 so haunted by a living face 
40 that all the dead rise up and stare; 41 
and the dumb time, the year that was 42 passes 
away. Memory is reborn, 43 form and forgiveness shine. 44 
So in this brilliant dark, dark of the year, 45 
shining is born. 46 We know what we do, 47 
and turn, and act in hope. 48 Now the wounds 
of time 49 have healed and are grown. 50 They 
are not wounds, they are mine, 51 they are healed 
into mouths. 52 They speak past wrongs. I am born; 
53 you bring shining, and births. 54 Here are the 
stories they tell you, 55 here are their songs.
