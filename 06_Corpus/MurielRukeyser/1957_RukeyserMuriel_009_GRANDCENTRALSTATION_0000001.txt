1 All the way to the city a crying in 
the air. 2 He walks the ramp into this shell 
of sound, 3 Acres of goodbye and the noise of 
the ocean 4 Of the waste of power. 5 Smell 
of the rock and metal; 6 Steel-pale and blue, the 
names of the calling 7 Fly up to the ceiling, 
the names of cities and stars 8 To justify distance. 
And the cries of parting. 9 Just listen to that, 
says the outsider in triumph. 10 Listen to all that 
noise! 11 Wheels and galleries of the control of tears. 
12 Goodbye, honey, goodbye. Goodbye. 13 Tunnels and wheels of 
language, an inordinate mouth 14 Shouting into a skin of 
echo. Poison, intoxication 15 Of immense foregrounds, the deeper bells 
of the past 16 Losing themselves in boasts and breakers, 
each man carrying 17 Sound like a name, like clothing, 
a proof assumed. 18 A man saying Hello walks up 
the ramp. His wife. His son 19 Hell, mother, says 
Willkie. We'll take this town!
