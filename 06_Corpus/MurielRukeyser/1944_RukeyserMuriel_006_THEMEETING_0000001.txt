1 One o'clock in the letter-box 2 Very black and 
I will go home early. 3 Now I have put 
off my dancing-dress 4 And over a sheet of distance 
write my love. 5 I walk in the city with 
my pride of theme 6 While the lean girls at 
their betrayal smiling 7 Dance, do their sea-green dance, and 
laugh in dancing. 8 And all the stars fade out 
of my sky. 9 Early in the morning on a 
windy ocean. 10 My sleep opens upon your face to 
kiss and find 11 And take diversion of the meeting 
waters, 12 The flameless sky of peace, blue-sided white air. 
13 I leave you as the trivial birds careen 14 
In separation, a dream of easy parting. 15 I see 
you through a door. The door sails away, 16 And 
all the ships move into the real sea. 17 Let 
that far day arrive, that evening stain! 18 Down the 
alleys of the night I trail a cloak; 19 Field-dusk 
and mountain-dusk and final darkness--- 20 Each absence brings me 
nearer to that night 21 When I stone-still in desire 
standing 22 Shall see the masked body of love enter 
the garden 23 To reach the night-burning, the perpetual fountain. 
24 And all the birds fly out of my scene.
