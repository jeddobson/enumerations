brings his stick 115 down on the naked head as 
the express pulls in, 116 swinging in locomotive roars on 
skull. 117 They are the question to the ambassador 118 
long-jawed and grim, they stand on marble, waiting 119 to 
ask how the terms of the strike have affected him. 
120 Answer: "I've never seen snow before. It's marvellous." 121 
They stand with Ann Burlak in the rotunda, knowing 122 
her insistent promise of life, remembering 123 the letter of 
the tear-gas salesman : "I hope 124 this strike develops 
and a damn bad one too. 125 We need the 
money." 126 This is the boundary 127 behind a speaker 
: Main Street and railroad tracks, 128 post office, furniture 
store. The soft moment before storm. 129 Since there are 
many years. 130 And the first years were the years 
of need, 131 the bleeding, the dragged foot, the wilderness, 
132 and the second years were the years of bread 
133 fat cow, square house, favorite work, 134 and the 
third years are the years of death. 135 The glittering 
eye all golden. Full of tears. 136 Years when the 
enemy is in our street, 137 and liberty, safe in 
the people's hands, 138 is never safe and peace is 
never safe. 139 Insults of attack arrive, insults 140 of 
mutilation. She knows the prophetic past, 141 many have marched 
behind her, and she knows 142 Rosa whose face drifts 
in the black canal, 143 the superstitions of a tragic 
winter 144 when children, their heads together, put on tears. 
145 The tears fall at their throats, their chains are 
made 146 of tears, and as bullets melted and as 
bombs let down 147 upon the ominous cities where she 
stands 148 fluid and conscious. Suddenly perceives 149 the world 
will never daily prove her words, 150 but her words 
live, they issue from this life. 151 She scatters clews. 
She speaks from all these faces 152 and from the 
center of a system of lives 153 who speak the 
desire of worlds moving unmade 154 saying, "Who owns the 
world?" and waiting for the cry.
