1 This is a lung disease. Silicate dust makes it. 
2 The dust causing the growth of 3 This is 
the X-ray picture taken last April. 4 I would point 
out to you: these are the ribs; 5 this is 
the region of the breastbone; 6 this is the heart 
(a wide white shadow filled with blood). 7 In here 
of course is the swallowing tube, esophagus. 8 The windpipe. 
Spaces between the lungs. 9 Between the ribs? 10 Between 
the ribs. These are the collar bones. 11 Now, this 
lung's mottled, beginning, in these areas. 12 You'd say a 
snowstorm had struck the fellow's lungs. 13 About alike, that 
side and this side, top and bottom. 14 The first 
stage in this period in this case. 15 Let us 
have the second. 16 Come to the window again. Here 
is the heart. 17 More numerous nodules, thicker, see, in 
the upper lobes. 18 You will notice the increase: here, 
streaked fibrous tissue--- 19 Indicating? 20 That indicates the progress 
in ten months' time. 21 And now, this year---short breathing, 
solid scars 22 even over the ribs, thick on both 
sides. 23 Blood vessels shut. Model conglomeration. 24 What stage? 
25 Third stage. Each time I place my pencil point:

is growing worse every day. At night 28 "I get

on my back I believe I would die." 30 It 
gradually chokes off the air cells in the lungs? 31 
I am trying to say it the best I can. 
32 That is what happens, isn't it? 33 A choking-off 
in the air cells? 34 Yes. 35 There is difficulty 
in breathing. 36 Yes. 37 And a painful cough? 38 
Yes. 39 Does silicosis cause death? 40 Yes, sir.
