1 A sound of screaming for thirteen centuries. 2 Look 
at the clock. It has never moved. 3 A sound 
of weeping for the generations. 4 Open your eyes. Monday 
morning. 5 In all the cities they are telling fortunes 
6 According to patterns flown by the bombing planes, 7 
And the shape of the Leader's genitals. 8 Bird-voice in 
darkness. Tremor of day moving. 9 The rocks accept brightness, 
now we imagine trees, 10 Across the crystals of time 
forming, suddenly 11 Feel the flaw of cold breeze following 
bird-voices. 12 The river remade, the invitation of water 13 
Flowing down toward the heart of my beloved. 14 A 
small man walks, thin cane, clown's feet of grace, 15 
Imagining in cold air down Charlie Street.
