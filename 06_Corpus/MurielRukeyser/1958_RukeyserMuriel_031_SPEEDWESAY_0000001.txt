1 Speed, we say of our time: racing my writing 
word 2 The jet now, the whole sky screaming his 
name, Speed. 3 But I know rapider, someone hauling horizons 
in 4 Beside whom the racing of the suns seems 
tame. 5 I know faster than the flashing of suddenly 
recognized love 6 Or yellow spring going glimpsing his green 
fame, 7 Love after long suffering like inward lightning, 8 
Assumed and lived through where now lovers lie warm, 9 
Wild and at peace among their colors. Speed. And now 
10 One quick-color mouth saying, "Now, love, now; 11 I 
have my spirit now, newborn and given, 12 The live 
delight; 13 It now is immediately not only spirit, not 
only mine, but 14 delight the forerunner 15 Of the 
depth of joy, most subtle, most rapid. 16 My two 
speeds, now, at last 17 Related, now at last in 
the same music--- 18 Light running before light."
