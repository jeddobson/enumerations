1 Wine and oil gleaming within their heads, 2 I 
poured it into the hollow of their bodies 3 but 
they did not speak. The light glittered. 4 Lit from 
underneath they were. Water 5 pouring over her face, it 
6 made the lips move and the eyes move, she 
7 spoke: 8 Break open. 9 He did not speak. 
10 A still lake shining in his head, 11 until 
I knew that the sun and the moon 12 stood 
in me with one light.13 They began to breathe and 
glitter. Morning 14 overflowed, gifts poured from their sex 15 
upon my throat and my breast. 16 They knew. They 
laughed. In their tremendous games 17 night revolved and shook 
my bed. I 18 woke in a cold morning. 19 
Your presences 20 allow me to begin to make myself 
21 carried on your shoulders, swayed in your arms. 22 
Something is flashing among the colors. I 23 move without 
being allowed. I 24 move with the blessing of the 
sky and the sea.25 Tonight I will try again for 
the music of truth 26 since this one and that 
one of mine are met with death. 27 It is 
a blind lottery, a cheap military trumpet 28 with all 
these great roots black under the earth 29 while a 
muscle-legged man 30 stamps in his red and gold 31 
rough wine, creatures in nets, swords through their spines 32 
and all their cantillation in our thought. 33 Glitter and 
pedestal under my female powers 34 a woman singing horses, 
blind cities of concrete, moon 35 comes to moonrise as 
a dark daughter. 36 I am the poet of the 
night of women 37 and my two parents are the 
sun and the moon, 38 a strong father of that 
black double likeness, 39 a bell kicking out of the 
bell-tower, 40 and a mother who shines and shines his 
light. 41 Who is the double ghost whose head is 
smoke? 42 Her thighs hold the wild infant, a trampled 
country 43 and I will fly in, in all my 
fears. 44 Those two have terrified me, but I live, 
45 their silvery line of music gave me girlhood 46 
and fierce male prowess and a woman's grave 47 eternal 
double music male and female, 48 inevitable blue, repeated evening 
49 of the two. Of the two.50 But these two 
figures are not the statues east and west 51 at 
my long window on the river they are mother and 
father 52 but not my actual parents only their memory. 
53 Not memory but something builded in my cells 54 
Father with your feet cut off 55 mother cut down 
to death 56 cut down my sister in the selfsame 
way 57 and my abandoned husband a madman of the 
sun 58 and you dark outlaw the other one when 
do we speak 59 The song flies out of all 
of you the song 60 starts in my body, the 
song 61 it is in my mouth, the song 62 
it is on my teeth, the song 63 it is 
pouring the song 64 wine and lightning 65 the rivers 
coming to confluence 66 in me entire.67 But that was 
years ago. My child is grown. 68 His wife and 
he in exile, that is, home, 69 longing for home, 
and I home, that is exile, the much-loved 70 country 
71 like the country called parents, much-loved that was, and 
exile. 72 His wife and he turning toward the thought 
73 of their own child, conceive we say, a child. 
74 Now rise in me the old dealings : father, 
mother, 75 not years ago, but in my last-night dream, 
76 waking this morning, the two Mexican figures 77 black 
stone with their stone hollows I fill with water, 78 
fill with wine, with oil, poems and lightning. 79 Black 
in morning dark, the sky going blue, 80 the river 
going blue. 81 Moving toward new form I am--- 82 
carry again 83 all the old gifts and wars.84 Black 
parental mysteries 85 groan and mingle in the night. 86 
Something will be born of this. 87 Pay attention to 
what they tell you to forget 88 pay attention to 
what they tell you to forget 89 pay attention to 
what they tell you to forget 90 Farewell the madness 
of the guardians 91 the river, the window, they are 
the guardians, 92 there is no guardian, it is all 
built into me. 93 Do I move toward form, do 
I use all my fears?
