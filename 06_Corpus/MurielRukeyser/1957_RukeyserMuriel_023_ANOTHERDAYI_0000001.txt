1 MISS LORENCE: The child among his powers gathering 2 
His words, his rich articulate joys and fears. 3 They 
are our fears, our joys, the questions of 4 all. 
5 His creations are real. His agonies 6 Are curiously 
related to the trouble of the 7 people of the 
world. 8 PAUL: There was a boy once, lived in 
a little house. 9 A big man came, started eating 
and eating. 10 He got to the boy, boy said, 
Dog, dog save 11 me. 12 Dog jumped the ocean 
and saved the little boy, 13 Then they lived together. 
14 The giant was discouraged. 15 After a while he 
saw his mother. Yawn I. 16 A man came and 
ate up the little pig. 17 How discouraging! How sad! 
18 Dis couraged little pig. 19 I am tired. Rest 
I will.
