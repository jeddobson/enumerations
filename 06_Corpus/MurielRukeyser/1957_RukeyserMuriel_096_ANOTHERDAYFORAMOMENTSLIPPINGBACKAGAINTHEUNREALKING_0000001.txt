Let's throw it. Let's throw ice at her face ... 
You should throw back! You should hurt me, Miss Lorence, 
not just stand there and laugh. Why do you let 
me hurt you? You hurt too . She throws the 
snowball. He howls, the howling biting; the biting sobbing, the 
sobbing thrown down in a snowdrift. 8 MISS LORENCE: Shall 
I go? 9 PAUL: I hate you. I hate you. 
10 No, no, you mustn't go. 11 I need you. 
Stay here. Why did you hurt me? 12 MISS LORENCE: 
But I didn't really.... You know ... And besides 13 
... why did you cry? 14 PAUL: You wanted to 
hurt me. You threw snow at me. 15 You were 
not my friend. 16 MISS LORENCE: But you asked me 
to throw snow. You cried when 17 I didn't. 18 
PAUL: I didn't really want you to. 19 MISS LORENCE: 
Then why did you ask me to? 20 PAUL: I 
wanted to hurt you 21 So you should hurt me; 
22 But I didn't really want you to. 23 MISS 
LORENCE: I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't want to. 
24 I was just playing your game with you. 25 
PAUL: It was not a game. 26 MISS LORENCE: You 
really wanted to hurt me? 27 PAUL: Yes. But not 
really. 28 Often I hate you, but I love you 
too. 29 I want to hurt you, but I don't 
want you to be hurt. 30 (He takes her hand 
and clings, for the first time in weeks. 31 Sighs 
and gets up.) 32 PAUL: Well, I guess I could 
go upstairs now. He was soft and quiet all that 
day. School went on. He painted his pictures and modeled 
in clay. He was very still, but not dependent. 34 
The sky is a tree. It spreads ... 35 I 
fly on the shiny hills to a bear's house ... 
36 My clock is magic. 37 I dreamed about the 
zero 38 And about Elizabeth 39 And about Miss Davison. 
40 I dreamed about the mat ... the doorbell, the 
whole, whole, 41 whole, whole, whole, Miss Lorence ... the 
world, the world.
