1 : After I am dead, darling, 2 my seventeen 
senses gone, 3 I shall love you as you wish, 
4 no sex, no mouth, but bone --- 5 in 
the way you long for now, 6 with my soul 
alone. 7 : When we are neither woman nor man 
8 but bleached to skeleton --- 9 when you have 
changed, my darling, 10 and all your senses gone, 11 
it is not me that you will love: 12 you 
will love everyone.
