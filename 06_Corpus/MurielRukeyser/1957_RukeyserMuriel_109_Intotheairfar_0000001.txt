1 Into the the air far. Into the opposites. 2 
Driving through sky into the otherworld, 3 In a real 
plane with four real whirls before him 4 Carrying him 
into his fantasy. 5 Now the dance of split and 
deliverance 6 Opens in swans before the wings. 7 Flowers, 
clouds, a game of paper kings. 8 And will you 
kill my dark lord down 9 Who stares the fiery 
lady? Luck 10 Is not the mirroring, is not the 
word, 11 Not the skillful red and black. 12 The 
enemy, the enemy. 13 How fare the wings around the 
wind, 14 Spun blade and angle of attack? 15 How 
take the ancient mountains of the soul, 16 And play, 
the flight forward being flight back? 17 My drink is 
airy gold. The cards I held 18 Are the same 
cards my card-hand hold, 19 While minutes, great miles of 
Asia, pass. 20 This jack, this statistical crowd, 21 Two-colored, 
while we're flying to the world. 22 Around the world, 
we say. I might have known 23 There's no way 
round my life or round the world. 24 There is 
only through. 25 Where all his meanings lead: 26 Into 
the fantasy of the opposite.
