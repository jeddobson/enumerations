1 This is the word our lips caress, our teeth 
bite 2 on the pale spongy fruit of this, the 
name : 3 mouthing the story, cowlike in dignity, and 
spitting it 4 in the tarnished cuspidor of present days. 
5 And if there were radium in Plymouth Rock, they 
would 6 not strike it 7 (bruising the fair stone), 
nor gawk at Semiramis on Main 8 Street 9 nor 
measure the gentle Christ in terms of horse-power. 10 Cracked 
bells are severally struck at noon. 11 The furrow of 
their ways will cradle us all. 12 Amen, amen, to 
the ritual of our habit, fall 13 before the repetitions 
in the lips of doom.14 The proud colors and brittle 
cloths, the supple smoke rising, 15 the metal symbols precious 
to our dreams 16 loftily borne. Thy Kingdom come . 
17 We have blessed the fields with speech. 18 There 
are alp-passes in the travelled mind 19 (they have stood 
in the quiet air, making signs on the sky 20 
to bless the cities of the shining plain). 21 The 
climate of the mind is the warmth of a shrine 
22 and the air torn with incense. World without end 
. 23 How can we bless this place : by 
the sweet horns, 24 the vaulted words, the pastoral lovers 
in the waist-deep grass, 25 remembrances linking back, hands raised 
like strict flames 26 pointing, 27 the feet of priests 
tracking the smooth earth, 28 many hands binding corn : 
? Thy Kingdom come . 29 There are pale steeples 
erect among the green, 30 blood falling before the eyes 
of love the lids fire-bright, 31 hands together in the 
fields, the born and unborn children, 32 and the wish 
for new blessing and the given blessing blend, 33 a 
glory clear in the man-tracks, in the blind 34 seeking 
for warmth in the climates of the mind. 35 World 
without end. 36 Amen.
