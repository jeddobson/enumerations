1 Whoever despises the clitoris despises the penis 2 Whoever 
despises the penis despises the cunt 3 Whoever despises the 
cunt despises the life of the child. 4 Resurrection music, 
silence, and surf.5 No longer speaking 6 Listening with the 
whole body 7 And with every drop of blood 8 
Overtaken by silence 9 But this same silence is become 
speech 10 With the speed of darkness.11 Stillness during war, 
the lake. 12 The unmoving spruces. 13 Glints over the 
water. 14 Faces, voices. You are far away. 15 A 
tree that trembles. 16 I am the tree that trembles 
and trembles.17 After the lifting of the mist 18 after 
the lift of the heavy rains 19 the sky stands 
clear 20 and the cries of the city risen in 
day 21 I remember the buildings are space 22 walled, 
to let space be used for living 23 I mind 
this room is space 24 this drinking glass is space 
25 whose boundary of glass 26 lets me give you 
drink and space to drink 27 your hand, my hand 
being space 28 containing skies and constellations 29 your face 
30 carries the reaches of air 31 I know I 
am space 32 my words are air.33 Between between 34 
the man : act exact 35 woman : in curve 
senses in their maze 36 frail orbits, green tries, games 
of stars 37 shape of the body speaking its evidence38 
I look across at the real 39 vulnerable involved naked 
40 devoted to the present of all I care for 
41 the world of its history leading to this moment.42 
Life the announcer. 43 I assure you 44 there are 
many ways to have a child. 45 I bastard mother 
46 promise you 47 there are many ways to be 
born. 48 They all come forth 49 in their own 
grace.50 Ends of the earth join tonight 51 with blazing 
stars upon their meeting. 52 These sons, these sons 53 
fall burning into Asia.54 Time comes into it. 55 Say 
it. Say it. 56 The universe is made of stories, 
57 not of atoms.58 Lying 59 blazing beside me 60 
you rear beautifully and up--- 61 your thinking face--- 62 
erotic body reaching 63 in all its colors and lights--- 
64 your erotic face 65 colored and lit--- 66 not 
colored body-and-face 67 but now entire, 68 colors lights the 
world thinking and reaching.69 The river flows past the city. 
70 Water goes down to tomorrow 71 making its children 
I hear their unborn voices 72 I am working out 
the vocabulary of my silence.73 Big-boned man young and of 
my dream 74 Struggles to get the live bird out 
of his throat. 75 I am he am I? Dreaming? 
76 I am the bird am I? I am the 
throat? 77 A bird with a curved beak. 78 It 
could slit anything, the throat-bird. 79 Drawn up slowly. The 
curved blades, not large. 80 Bird emerges wet being born 
81 Begins to sing.82 My night awake 83 staring at 
the broad rough jewel 84 the copper roof across the 
way 85 thinking of the poet 86 yet unborn in 
this dark 87 who will be the throat of these 
hours. 88 No. Of those hours. 89 Who will speak 
these days, 90 if not I, 91 if not you?
