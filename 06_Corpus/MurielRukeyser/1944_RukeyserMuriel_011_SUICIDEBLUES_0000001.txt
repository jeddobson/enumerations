1 I want to speak in my voice! 2 I 
want to speak in my real voice! 3 This street 
leads into the white wind 4 I am not yet 
ready to go there. 5 Not in my real voice. 
6 The river. Do you know where the river springs? 
7 The river issues from a tall man, 8 From 
his real voice. 9 Do you know where the river 
is flowing? 10 The river flows into a singing woman, 
11 In her real voice. 12 Are you able to 
imagine truth? 13 Evil has conspired a world of death, 
14 An unreal voice. 15 The death-world killed me when 
the flowers shine, 16 In spring, in front of the 
little children, 17 It threw me burning out of the 
window 18 And all my enemies phoned my friends, 19 
But my legs went running around that building 20 Dancing 
to the suicide blues. 21 They flung me into the 
sea 22 The sunlight ran all over my face, 23 
The water was blue the water was dark brown 24 
And my severed head swam around that ship 25 Three 
times around and it wouldn't go down. 26 Too much 
life, my darling, embraces and strong veins, 27 Every sense 
speaking in my real voice, 28 Too many flowers, a 
too-knowing sun, 29 Too much life to kill.
