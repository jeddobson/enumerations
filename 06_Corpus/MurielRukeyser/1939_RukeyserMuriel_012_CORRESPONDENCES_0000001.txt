1 Democritus laughed when he 2 saw his whole universe 
3 combined of atoms, and 4 the gods destroyed--- 5 
He killed the ghostly 6 vengeance deep at the source, 
7 holding bright philosophical sand 8 up for a threat--- 
9 laughing his soldier laughter 10 with ages of troops 
after 11 who grin with reason in 12 the trenches 
of 13 metaphysics, astronomy, disease, 14 philosophy, the state, and 
poetry, 15 the black-and-white war on sin, 16 the dead 
wars, the impossible dark wars, 17 the war on starve, 
the war on kill, the war on love, 18 the 
war on peace.19 I was born in winter when 20 
Europe heard the early guns, 21 when I was five, 
the drums 22 welcomed home the men. 23 The spring 
after my birth 24 a tree came out of the 
lake, 25 I laughed, for I could not speak; 26 
the world was there to learn. 27 The richest season 
in 28 the headlines fell as I was ten, 29 
but the crazies were forgotten, 30 the fine men, the 
bravest men. 31 When I had reached fifteen, 32 that 
pliant tree was dark, 33 breadlines haunted the parks--- 34 
the books tricked-in that scene. 35 No work in any 
town 36 when I was twenty, cured 37 the thin 
and desperate poor 38 from being forced alone. 39 Clear 
to half a brain 40 in a blind man's head, 
41 war must follow that tide 42 of running milk 
and grain. 43 Now China's long begun, 44 that tree 
is dense and strong, 45 spreading, continuing--- 46 and Austria; 
and Spain. 47 If some long unborn friend 48 looks 
at photos in pity, 49 we say, sure we were 
happy, 50 but it was not in the wind. 51 
Half my twenties are gone 52 as the crazies take 
to the planes, 53 the fine men, the bravest men, 
54 and the war goes on.55 When Barcelona fell, the 
darkened glass 56 turned on the world an immense ruinous 
gaze, 57 mirror of prophecy in a series of mirrors. 
58 I meet it in all the faces that I 
see. 59 Decisions of history the radios reverse; 60 storm 
over continents, black rays around the chief, 61 finished in 
lightning, the little chaos raves. 62 I meet it in 
all the faces that I see. 63 Inverted year with 
one prophetic day, 64 high wind, forgetful cities, and the 
war, 65 the terrible time when everyone writes "hope." 66 
I meet it in all the faces that I see. 
67 When Barcelona fell, the cry on the roads 68 
assembled horizons, and the circle of eyes 69 looked with 
a lifetime look upon that image, 70 defeat among us, 
and war, and prophecy, 71 I meet it in all 
the faces that I see.72 Wars between wars, laughter behind 
the lines. 73 Fighting behind the lines. Not chiIdren Iaughing, 
74 but the trench-laughter of the wounded, of radios, 75 
of animal cartoons, the lonely broadcast 76 on the taxi 
dashboard, behind the wrecking crew 77 lit by a naked 
bulb---to the forgetful bars 78 prisms and amber shaken with 
laughter, to the ships at sea. 79 To the maleficent 
walls of cities, and an old actress 80 trying against 
the trying wind under the skyscrapers, 81 blind ageing face 
up, still the look of the lioness, 82 walking close 
to the buildings, along the wall, 83 she licks her 
lips in panic of loneliness. 84 She understands the laughter 
that rides around the streets, 85 blowing the news to 
the stone-lands, the swamp-lands, the dust 86 where omens of 
war, restless in clouds of dust, 87 mean dust is 
never an anachronism 88 and ruin's news. 89 The actress 
knows. Laughter takes up the slack, 90 changes the fact, 
narrowing it to nothing, 91 hardly a thing but silence 
on a stage. 92 Crack of laughter. Walls go white, 
and the plain open note 93 talks in a houseful 
of noise. Reply : Now hide! 94 Over the air, 
the blindfold answer, the news of force, 95 the male 
and hairless hand of fear 96 in a shiny leather 
sleeve 97 armed. 98 The radiations of harm : black 
grooves in photographs, 99 blackness in spokes playing from Hitler's 
head. 100 A head with one nightmare. 101 Expect failure 
of plans, the floodgates closing, 102 failure of traffic-control, loss 
of voice, fog. 103 Wires dead, defection of your central 
power-plant. 104 A code : Laughter. What alphabet are they 
using? 105 Many wished for little. 106 Many asked unity. 
107 We had our characters as we had our cities, 
108 or as a lyric poet has his voices, audible 
109 as separate lives, maturing in poise, and symbols 110 
coming to their "great period," too big to kill, 111 
able to batter at the jetties of hell. 112 Rites 
of initiation of our lives: 113 by filth in childhood, 
114 by wealth in the middle, 115 by death at 
the end. 116 We knew the dear, the enemy, we 
saw the spy 117 whisper at ear, the agency suggest, 
118 and where no secrecy and treason were 119 we 
saw the novelist, pimp of character, 120 develop the age 
so it be understood 121 to read like his book, 
a city of the dead. 122 But the century had 
its rites, its politics, 123 machineries whose characters were wars. 
124 Ceremonies of further separation. And now, our backs to 
125 bricks, 126 war closes in, calling us to the 
guns 127 to make accounting how our time was spent. 
128 And the planes fall. Soon the whole incident is 
129 over, all but the consequences. 130 Laughter, and childhood; 
and laughter; and age; or death. 131 Call to the 
male puppet, Croak, 132 and to the female puppet, Shriek, 
133 and turn on me your gun for luck. 134 
Take us our sacrifices, a wish for the living, 135 
this foil of thought, this soil from which we sprang, 
136 fugal music of peace, the promises well-kept, 137 the 
big and little diaries of the dead. 138 The song 
of occupations and the ghosts, 139 the historian, pimp of 
centuries, the general, pimp of wars, 140 the Floating Man, 
gentle above the cities, 141 afraid to touch, a cloud 
before his head, 142 laughing the laugh of a man 
about to be drafted, 143 the flier, mock-protagonist of his 
time, 144 refugees who reserve a final condemnation 145 and 
see a richer horror in the sky. 146 Humor, saliva 
of terror, will not save the day 147 or even 
one moment when the cities are 148 high in a 
boneyard where clowns ride up and down 149 and a 
night crew works quickly before morning; 150 while news arrives 
of the death of others, 151 laughter of brothers and 
the brother wars, 152 works of an age among such 
characters. 153 Violent electric night! and the age spiralling past 
154 and the sky turning over, and the wind turning 
the stars.
