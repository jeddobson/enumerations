light. 239 Organization of lectures and modest entertainment. 240 But 
the audience struggled out after the second solo. 241 Log's 
entry: "Engines and instruments in good condition, 242 barmaid in 
labor, supply of fresh meat running low. 243 Insubordination common 
among the men. Fruit holding out. 244 Feeling against ship's 
orders is met with discipline." 245 But at night 246 
confusion over the course, anger, lack of sleep, 247 ominous 
quarrels over strange constellations. 248 Distress of tourists; they dream 
of housedogs, house-animals, 249 the 6 a.m. cry of lapdogs 
as the child is delivered, 250 crying but not hungry, 
refusing food, mumbling. 251 Dreams of distress : ape-murder, invective, 
the autumnal escape, 252 stumbling dead in the dry leaves, 
hunting someone, not 253 mentioning whom. 254 Dying. The barmaid's 
little baby's dying words 255 were the words with which 
its weekend life began : 256 Mother it said, enunciating 
distinctly, 257 refusing food. 258 They slid the two-foot coffin 
overboard, 259 a small white circle drowning in green water. 
260 Identical sickness; but the barmaid did not speak, the 
crew 261 worked or looked up from work, waiting for 
shore, 262 worked with a mutinous hope. The poet spoke 
to the blonde 263 mentioning love. She smiled when he 
said, "I praise the 264 marvel physical flowers upon your 
trellis skeleton, I welcome 265 from you, the discipline of 
every part." He thought, Elaborate, 266 I wait for the 
release, the explosive distorting act 267 with the same fever 
that they wait for land; 268 it fills the mind 
269 it is my port, lighthouse, coastal clew, token, 270 
suggesting harbors, a shore-image. 271 The close-up in the mind, 
the head enlarging to fill 272 the sky with its 
immense unique idea; 273 Homer wrote Helen blind, the unfree 
are praising freedom, 274 I know the exquisite taste of 
the sight of land. 275 If we saw grass, it 
would speak, it would say 'green,' 276 I dream of 
a boat riding on towery waves 277 overriding blond pebbles, 
grating on stone, 278 I have a superstition about land: 
279 it is our wisdom, 280 contact and cause, without 
which only grows 281 abstinence, pestilence, unbalance. 282 But if 
a sound can travel to restore 283 the tight prophetic 
brain, but if a ringing 284 can travel out over 
electric seas: 285 Bells cannot ring from water, land must 
wait 286 where bells invite, strong, with their Latin chiming. 
287 The crew looks up to the passenger rail; the 
poet 288 stands with his face into the vocal night: 
289 Funera plango, fulgura frango, Sabbata pango, 290 excito lentos, 
dissipo ventos, paco cruentos. 291 "What do they ring?" shouted 
the sailor. 292 "Calling of funerals, breaking the lightning, pealing 
the 293 Sabbath, 294 waking the lazy, dissolving wind, peace 
to the evil." 295 "They have power," shouted the sailor, 
296 "read what they mean." 297 But the boat lost 
their plango 298 and on the wind frango night pango, 
299 failing sifted over the water 300 until one bell 
repeated singular music, 301 only and loud. 302 Vox ego, 
ringing august, 303 vox ego sum vitae; voco vos. 304 
"That hails us," shouted the sailor, 305 "who is that?" 
306 "That voice of life," he interpreted, "calling you." 307 
The cheer came. 308 "They can hear us!" shouted the 
sailor. 309 "Lucky you know the language," said the blonde 
310 as the hurrah went down. "What are the signals, 
311 what do they mean?" 312 "God," he said, "revelation! 
closing over the world, 313 breaking on the air, the 
wasted sounds among 314 shouts and the violent bullet in 
the mouth, 315 our age broken like stone, all grace 
run out of grasp, 316 perfected music I could never 
reach. 317 Listen!" he shouted, "triumph of bells, swinging! And 
for me, 318 bells alive also under the sea," walking 
319 the length of the deck, rising up tall, diving, 
320 the arc, the avalanche. 321 "Insane!" the critic captain, 
"doesn't he 322 know that the sea is full of 
teeth?" 323 "Send boats out!" "You'll not reclaim that man," 
said the blonde, 324 but the crew were dropping their 
small boats overside. 325 The body was gone. The sailor 
whistled. The rest of the crew 326 dropped down their 
lifeboats. "Who'll make the land, they hear 327 us!" the 
sailor shouted, 328 "who's with us?" "Criminal fools!" threatened the 
captain, 329 and his pistol twitched the sea around them, 
"mutinous fools, 330 you'll hang or drown!" "Off your law-haunted 
ship! Trying for land!" 331 The union man, barmaid, radio 
operator, child who wanted 332 the ground jumped--- 333 but 
the blond stood crying at the rail 334 not daring 
to be saved. 335 "Attempt land!" shouted the sailor, "fight 
for something we know!" 336 pulling on oars toward the 
origin of bells, 337 but the great ship was continuing, 
night advanced, the captain : 338 "Fanatic clowns, with their 
contamination, 339 laughter and mutiny!" and into severe morning, 340 
the crazy alcohol blue, the bloodshot afternoon. 341 "I wanted 
to go," the blonde. "Loved that suicide?" asked the 342 
captain, 343 "you'll love me too, you'll have your love, 
only believe 344 their song was mad, 345 'Free grace 
and dyin love, Free grace and dyin love 346 Free 
grace and dyin love, to ring dem charmin bells.'" 347 
Pool money. Slaughter the polo ponies for meat. Tamper with 
348 radio. 349 No sound from the world, and the 
water giving out. 350 A continent of sea: they wished 
formal December, blue snow, 351 suffering cold, but earth. And 
the sun came down 352 bare as the condor, elegant 
on the sea. 353 Mist rose, a threat of mist, 
ranging horizons, 354 the captain laughed, "Remember the landslide on 
Chartreuse, 355 and does the sea slide down on our 
monastics? 356 By God," he 357 swore, "they were correct, 
they knew, when they mutinied!" 358 "Oh no," said the
