1 Bleeding of the mountains 2 the noon bleeding 3 
he is shot through the voice 4 all things being 
broken 5 The moon returning in her blood 6 looks 
down grows white 7 loses color 8 and blazes 9 
. . . and the near star gone --- 10 
voices of cities 11 drumming in the moon 12 bleeding 
of my right hand 13 my black voice bleeding
