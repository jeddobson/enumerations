Orpheus 1 When I wrote of the women in their 
dances and wildness, it was 2 a mask, 3 on 
their mountain, gold-hunting, singing, in orgy, 4 it was a 
mask; when I wrote of the god, 5 fragmented, exiled 
from himself, his life, the love gone down 6 with 
song, 7 it was myself, split open, unable to speak, 
in exile from myself. 8 There is no mountain, there 
is no god, there is memory 9 of my torn 
life, myself split open in sleep, the rescued child 10 
beside me among the doctors, and a word 11 of 
rescue from the great eyes. 12 No more masks! No 
more mythologies! 13 Now, for the first time, the god 
lifts his hand, 14 the fragments join in me with 
their own music.
