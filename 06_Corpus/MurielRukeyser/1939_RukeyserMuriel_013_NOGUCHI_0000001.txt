1 Since very soon it is required of you. 2 
Even here, on this bed, your face turned up and 
away, 3 a strong statue's face turned up and away, 
4 the spangled eye staring live and away. 5 And 
the call comes : Open and now obey. 6 Now 
it is coming from a roomful of cats, 7 the 
dead man on the cot, desert outside, 8 mesa and 
goldmine around a tombstone town. 9 The cat flies shouting 
from the dead man's mouth. 10 News of the world 
: Open and now obey. 11 Now it is coming 
during the major climax, 12 when the brain is suprised 
and singing only medley. 13 Or in the meeting. Or 
at lunch around the rink 14 with the stranger and 
the stories of Libyan maneuvers, 15 horror's imperative the heart 
obeys. 16 When they ask you What were you doing 
at that hour, 17 When the headlines predicted it What 
street did you walk 18 When they insist Prove yourself 
alive that afternoon 19 It was coming then And everybody 
saw it 20 Your life pointed to that That was 
your world. 21 I think of effort. Brought us to 
birth in force. 22 Noguchi's mother with her scalded child 
23 wedged her awake with splinters in the eyes. 24 
If you are falling fallen failing, force 25 will suffice, 
must fix yourself alert. 26 Sleeping, I saw awake a 
widened world. 27 I saw a well full of men's 
eyes that weep, 28 wrong ghosts sailing the cities praised 
our night, 29 but effort of light comes, overflow morning 
30 waking no weeping, the series of twelve doors 31 
strike shut like clock, but my light will not go; 
32 woke. Love, we'll stay awake until it's healed, 33 
until the time is brought to a fair hour, 34 
obey the heart that calls to prove alive 35 a 
love, an age, all soldiers home again, 36 the growing 
time a child up and alive, 37 until the world 
is done.
