for Frances C. Wickes on her ninetieth birthday, August 28, 
1965 1 Stroke by stroke, in the country of the 
fragile 2 stroke by stroke, each act a season 3 
speaking the years of making 4 this flower 5 shining 
over the fears 6 over the cities 7 and the 
camps of death. 8 Shines from a field 9 of 
eighty-seven years, 10 the young child and the dream. 11 
In my city of stone, 12 water and light 13 
I saw the blue flower 14 held still, and flying 
--- 15 never seen by me 16 but in your 
words given; 17 fragile, mortal 18 that endures. 19 By 
turns flying and still. 20 "Angkor Vat, a gray stone 
city 21 but the flight of kingfishers 22 all day 
enlivened it"--- 23 a blue flash given to us, past 
stone and time. 24 Blaze of mortality 25 piercing, tense 
26 the structure of a dream 27 speaking and fragile, 
28 momentary, 29 for now 30 and ever and all 
31 your blue flower.
