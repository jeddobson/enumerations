man questioned the captain, urged a landing, 127 spoke to 
small groups. (Official entry, "First signs of 128 passengers' unrest. 
Insults, high temperatures.") 129 "They must be fighting for something 
we know," he said, 130 "I saw men advancing down 
those inspired hills, 131 guns and grenades are timed now 
against tyrants, 132 a wish to keep 133 us all 
alive! under its strictest grip 134 logical strength challenges conscience 
up." 135 "We must arrive at land," the union man 
kept saying, 136 "there's work." "You!" said the poet, "a 
wandering motive! 137 The captain knows here's a hot country 
coming 138 among rich water, I see it! the city 
at ease, 139 the islands braceletted with cloud, sky blue 
of mania." 140 "So long as we land." "We'll land 
in a port fit to receive us, 141 fleshly and 
bright, set in a frivolous growth, 142 giraffe plants, monster 
flowers." 143 Far off, the beach 144 lay white at 
the white water's edge, proclaiming 145 the hostile beauty of 
that savage coast. 146 Hot city, terraced by color, tropical 
among green, 147 vermilion blossom; and the mulatto cinnamon. 148 
"This," said the poet, "my terror, my superstition, 149 here's 
a perfect city that we will dare not enter, 150 
point me perfection, I'll show you warning and Captain's Orders, 
151 or dangerous action; or tenderness, prelude to violence, 152 
any promise painted in terms of acid Picasso 153 is 
signed Beware." And a small boat put smoothly out from 
harbor 154 and the man called 155 from it, below 
the ship, his least words taking on 156 significance, being 
in a foreign language. 157 The radio operator, translating; "I 
am here for Quarantine. 158 No quarantine man. Dead. Plague 
in the town---epidemic, 159 the ships bring it in, says 
the mayor. The doctors do not know. 160 Most of 
the town is dead. They have voted. Are laying mines 
161 all through the harbor. Around you now. I'm instructed 
: 162 Torpedo all craft attempting to come in. 163 
Our rich have donated handsomely for explosives." 164 Sand, green 
water, litter of wavy sunlight. 165 "No landing place," 166 
the captain, "you guessed," to the poet. He shivers, laughing, 
167 "let them come after and make me clich√©." 168 
"But you're original now," said the captain; "we're sailing to 
169 Nothing 170 doubtful or dangerous, predict a landing-place." "I'll 
make my 171 own landfall," 172 answered the poet. "Not 
alone," said the union man. 173 "Individual harbor, 174 and 
you'll discover yours---man, most successful animal, 175 can disembark according 
to his need; you!" he accused the women, 176 "I 
must have love," insisted the blonde; "What do you want," 
177 asked the captain, 178 "another botched affair?" "My child," 
said the barmaid. "And 179 you'll leave the ship!" 180 
"Let them alone, they're right," said the union man. And 
the 181 crew sang from the 182 lower deck--- 183 
'Wade . . in the water, chillen, wade . . 
in the water, chillen, wade 184 . . in the 
water, chillen, 185 Gods's a-gone to trouble the water.' 186 
"Where is the cruise the travel posters promised? The dancing 
187 partners, quick landing?" 188 the blonde demanded. "The epidemic 
harbor's faded, is the 189 radio dead?" 190 "It answers 
only War." "Put in to port, if war is everywhere," 
191 the union man, "accept obtainable things." "I have my 
192 orders," answered the captain. 193 "Arbitrary commands!" "Do not 
be cynic at the captain's 194 religion," 195 the financier. 
"Commands are dead, he's a dead priest, the 196 other's 
living, 197 this is a new voyage that you have 
not known." 198 "I've thought it out through orders," said 
the captain. 199 The sailor cried, 200 "We have our 
orders from you; but I saw a book, 201 and 
I saw a book, and I'll attempt before I die." 
202 The poet called to the sailor, "What do you 
make of that city? 203 Of this rich water? Of 
captain's rules?" "I'll wait," shouted the sailor. 204 "If we 
are named," said the poet, "it is guilty generation." 205 
"I'll wait a bit; and claim not guilt but anger, 
206 and I see land!" The city on the cape 
207 stood straight ahead, assuming the quality of dream, 208 
silent, receptive, under the summer air. 209 The passengers sighted 
these last-chance piers, the towers 210 and over them, 211 
over the color of street, roof, public pier, 212 and 
house: the vision, the puzzle in mid-air. 213 Is it 
the cloud? What's falling out of the sky? Is it 
214 a storm falling? for a flame shot down, trailing 
215 a falling plane, dropping behind the turning wings, clear 
flame in air, 216 and over it the dark cloud, 
spinning, noisy, resolving 217 to a cloud of planes, gunning. 
Among them, a white core, 218 the single parachute. As 
the flier descended 219 the planes circled him. Vertigo of 
machine-guns. And his dead body 220 swung, receiving bullets, sinking 
hooded by white 221 into the city. 222 Into the 
arson of the burning plane 223 fallen faster than flier 
in cage. 224 "That's our illness," concluded the poet, "the 
war our age must win," 225 as the ship continued 
into pale sea, bright sea, hurrying south, 226 "I know 
its breath on my face, have noted all its symptoms, 
227 have heard cats shouting, seen the worn eye stare 
228 up from the doormat, the flowerbed, under the wave, 
229 learned all the disease of this progressive time." 230 
"Can it be cured?" asked the sailor. "At its root," 
said the 231 union man, 232 "by reaching it." As 
the ship persevered out from land. 233 "Reach it," 234 
repeated the blonde, "what must we take to our breast, 
235 what must we kiss away?" 236 When the coast 
fell at last, the passengers' wish was apparent, 237 they 
dreamed of some simple convenient city, peaceful, wired 238 for
