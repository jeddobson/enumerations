1 The drowning young man lifted his face from the 
river 2 to me, exhausted from calling for help and 
weeping; 3 "My love!" I said; but he kissed me 
once for ever 4 and returned to his privacy and 
secret keeping. 5 His close face dripped with the attractive 
water, 6 I stared in his eyes and saw there 
penalty, 7 for the city moved in its struggle, loud 
about us, 8 and the salt air blew down; but 
he would face the sea. 9 "Afraid, afraid, my love?" 
But he will never speak, 10 looking demands for rest, 
watching the wave come up, 11 too timid to turn, 
too loving to cry out, 12 lying face down in 
tide, biting his nervous lip. 13 Take him by shoulder 
and jaw, break his look back on us, 14 O 
hard to save, be saved, before we all shall drown! 
15 But he has set his look, plunged his life 
deep for peace, 16 his face in the boiling river, 
and is surrendered down.
