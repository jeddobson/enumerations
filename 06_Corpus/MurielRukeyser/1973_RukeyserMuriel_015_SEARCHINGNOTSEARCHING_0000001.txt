1 What kind of woman goes searching and searching? 2 
Among the furrows of dark April, along the sea-beach, 3 
in the faces of children, in what they could not 
tell; 4 in the pages of centuries --- 5 for 
what man? for what magic? 6 In corridors under the 
earth, in castles of the North, 7 among the blackened 
miners, among the old 8 I have gone searching. 9 
The island-woman told me, against the glitter of sun 10 
on the stalks and leaves of a London hospital. 11 
I searched for that Elizabethan man, 12 the lost discoverer, 
the servant of time; 13 and that man forgotten for 
belief, in Spain, 14 and among the faces of students, 
at Coventry, 15 finding and finding in glimpses. And at 
home. 16 Among the dead I too have gone searching, 
17 a blue light in the brain. 18 Suddenly I 
come to these living eyes, 19 I a live woman 
look up at you this day 20 I see all 
the colors in your look.21 High above shores and times, 
22 I on the shore 23 forever and ever. 24 
Moses my brother 25 has crossed over 26 to milk, 
honey, 27 that holy land. 28 Building Jerusalem. 29 I 
sing forever 30 on the seashore. 31 I do remember 
32 horseman and horses, 33 waves of passage 34 poured 
into war, 35 all poured into journey. 36 My unseen 
brothers 37 have gone over; 38 chariots 39 deep seas 
under. 40 I alone stand here 41 ankle-deep 42 and 
I sing, I sing, 43 until the lands 44 sing 
to each other.45 Angel of declaring, you opened before us 
walls, 46 the lives of children, water as power. 47 
To control the water is to control our days, 48 
to build a dam is to face the enemy. 49 
We will form a new person who will step forward, 
50 he it is, she it is, assumes full life, 
51 fully responsible. We will bring all the children, 52 
they will decide together. 53 We will ask these children 
: what is before you? 54 They will say what 
they see. 55 They will say what they don't see. 
56 Once again we breathe in discovery. 57 A man, 
a woman, 58 will discover 59 we are each other's 
sources.60 They are pouring the city: 61 they tear down 
the towers, 62 grind their lives, 63 laughing tainted, the 
river 64 flows down to tomorrow. 65 They are setting 
the forms, 66 pouring the new buildings. 67 Our days 
pour down. 68 I am pouring my poems.69 Brecht saying 
: Galileo talking astronomy 70 Stripped to the torso, the 
intellectual life 71 Pouring from this gross man in his 
nakedness. 72 Galileo, his physical contentment 73 Is having his 
back rubbed by his student; the boy mauls; 74 The 
man sighs and transforms it; intellectual product! 75 Galileo spins 
a toy of the earth around 76 The spinning sun; 
he looks at the student boy. 77 Learning is teaching, 
teaching is learning. 78 Galileo 79 Demonstrates how horrible is 
betrayal, 80 Particularly on the shore of a new era.81 
There was always a murder within another murder. 82 Red 
leaves and rosy threads bind them together. 83 The hero 
of Vietnam's epic is a woman 84 and she has 
sold herself to save her father. 85 Odor of massacres 
spread on the sky. 86 Loneliness, the windy, dusty world. 
87 The roads crowded with armor and betrayal. 88 Mirror 
of the sun and moon, this land, 89 in which 
being handed to soldiers is the journey. 90 Shame, disgrace, 
change of seas into burnt fields. 91 Banners, loudspeakers, violation 
of each day, 92 everything being unjust. But she does 
save him, 93 and we find everything in another way.94 
Climbing the air, prophet beyond prophet 95 leaning upon creation 
backward to the first 96 creation the great spark of 
night 97 breathing sun energy a gap between finger-tips 98 
across all of space or nothing, infinity. 99 But beyond 
this, with this, these 100 arms raising reaching wavering 101 
as from the floor of ocean 102 wavering showing swaying 
like sea-plants 103 pointing straight up closing the gap between 
104 continual creation and the daily touch.105 From you I 
learned the dark potential 106 theatres of the acts of 
man holding 107 on a rehearsal stage people and lights. 
108 You in your red hair ran down the darkened 
109 aisle, making documents and poems 110 in their people 
form the play. 111 Hallie it was from you I 
learned this: 112 you told the company in dress-rehearsal 113 
in that ultimate equipped building what they lacked: 114 among 
the lighting, the sight-lines, the acoustics, 115 the perfect revolving 
stage, they lacked only one thing 116 the most important 
thing. It would come tonight: 117 The audience the response 
118 Hallie I learned from you this summer, this 119 
Hallie I saw you lying all gone to bone 120 
tremor of bone I stroked the head all sculpture 121 
I held the hands of birds I spoke to the 
sealed eyes 122 the soft live red mouth of a 
red-headed woman. 123 I knew Hallie then I could move 
without answer, 124 like the veterans for peace, hurling back 
their medals 125 and not expecting an answer from the 
grass. 126 You taught me this in your dying, for 
poems and theatre 127 and love and peace-making that living 
and my love 128 are where response and no-response 129 
meet at last, Hallie, in infinity.130 They have asked me 
to speak in public 131 and set me a subject. 
132 I hate anything that begins : the artist as 
... 133 and as for "social critic" 134 at the 
last quarter of the twentieth century 135 I know what 
that is: 136 late at night, among radio music 137 
the voice of my son speaking half-world away 138 coming
