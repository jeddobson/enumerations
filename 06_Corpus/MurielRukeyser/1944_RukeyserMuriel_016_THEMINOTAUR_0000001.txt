1 Trapped, blinded, led; and in the end betrayed 2 
Daily by new betrayals as he stays 3 Deep in 
his labyrinth, shaking and going mad. 4 Betrayed. Betrayed. Raving, 
the beaten head 5 Heavy with madness, he stands, half-dead 
and proud. 6 No one again will ever see his 
pride. 7 No one will find him by walking to 
him straight 8 But must be led circuitously about, 9 
Calling to him and close and, losing the subtle thread, 
10 Lose him again; while he waits, brutalized 11 By 
loneliness. Later, afraid 12 Of his own suffering. At last, 
savage and made 13 Ravenous, ready to prey upon the 
race 14 If it so much as learn the clews 
of blood 15 Into his pride his fear his glistening 
heart. 16 Now is the patient deserted in his fright 
17 And love carrying salvage round the world 18 Lost 
in a crooked city; roundabout, 19 By the sea, the 
precipice, all the fantastic ways 20 Betrayal weaves its trap; 
loneliness knows the thread, 21 And the heart is lost, 
lost, trapped, blinded and led, 22 Deserted at the middle 
of the maze.
