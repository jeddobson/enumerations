1 Invading nightmare, spinning up through sleep, 2 three loving 
Negresses ascend the night; 3 one sinks with Chinese eyes 
a despised man 4 shivering white in fear; mocking says 
"Take him, 5 I made him vastly unhappy;" dances, lifting 
6 the purple belly pencilled delicate black. 7 The grandmother 
rises on the pointed shoulder 8 of the little black 
boy in the pink wool sweater, 9 bitterly asking about 
the deputies. 10 Burning, as dead skies over enemy cities 
11 tip backward sliding, a third gleams on the South; 
12 battlefields flicker, the scenery of doubt 13 dissolves in 
decoration on the night of 14 fire, black women, nightmare, 
dances, sleep.
