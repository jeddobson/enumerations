1 Down from Chicago Bryan came, 2 His voice was 
marvelous, silver and free, 3 He visited the Willkie home; 
4 He said T.R. is all our shame. 5 Your 
father has a passion for freedom, Wendell. 6 When we 
turn in on ourselves our face. 7 We are American. 
We thrive 8 Our currency needs a double base, 9 
We are for silver, and we are silver, 10 Said 
Mr. Bryan. 11 The struggle, I heard Mr. Carlisle say, 
12 Finds the holders of idle capital 13 Here, and 
those who produce and pay 14 Here ---and where will 
the party fight? 15 The party must answer, as each 
man may. 16 Don't you agree, Herman? 17 Don't you 
agree that there are two ideas 18 Of government : 
Make rich the well-to-do, 19 And their prosperity will rain 
on you. 20 The Democrats' idea, however, is 21 Make 
strong the base, make the masses prosperous, 22 Their wealth 
will sprout and flower for all of us. 23 Oh, 
let him do it, Herman. He's only---what?---four? 24 They tell 
us the cities want to stick to gold. 25 The 
cities rest on our prairies. If they burn 26 And 
we are all that's left, those stones will rise again. 
27 My throat does tickle. I think I'm catching cold. 
28 If only my throat holds out for the whole 
campaign! 29 Could I trouble you for a hot compress, 
Herman, 30 Or perhaps a gargle? 31 Your father is 
saying It is hard 32 To keep the people on 
their guard 33 Or to make them take the longer 
view. 34 All you are saying may be true, but 
35 What about imperialism? 36 Our thoughts cannot be stopped 
by seas. 37 Oh, no, said Bryan. 38 But these 
are sins and contraries, 39 The founders hated such as 
these. 40 And the Louisiana Purchase? said your father. 41 
That wasn't imperialism, Bryan said. 42 Of course not, said 
your father. 43 But if McKinley's ugly head 44 Looks 
out from Washington, I dread 45 The future poor, the 
future dead, 46 And Teddy Roosevelt, 47 Said Mr. Bryan. 
48 Rang and rang, rang in the small boy's head.
