1 Consumed. Eaten away. And love across the street. 2 
I had a letter in the mail this morning 3 
Dear Sir, . . . pleasure . . . enclosing 
herewith our check . . . 4 payable to you, 
for $21.59 5 being one-half of the residue which 6 
we were able to collect in your behalf 7 in 
regard to the above case. 8 In winding up the 
various suits, 9 after collecting all we could, 10 we 
find this balance due you. 11 With regards, we are 
12 Very truly, 13 After collecting 14 the dust the 
failure the engineering corps 15 O love consumed eaten away 
the foreman laughed 16 they wet the drills when the 
inspectors came 17 the moon blows glassy over our native 
river. 18 O love tell the committee that I know: 
19 never repeat you mean to marry me. 20 In 
mines, the fans are large (2,000 men unmasked) 21 before 
his verdict the doctor asked me How long 22 I 
said, Dr. Harless, tell me how long? 23 ---Only never 
again tell me you'll marry me. 24 I watch how 
at the tables you all day 25 follow a line 
of clouds the dance of drills, 26 and, love, the 
sky birds who crown the trees 27 the white white 
hills standing upon Alloy 28 ---I charge negligence, all companies 
concerned--- 29 two years O love two years he said 
he gave. 30 The swirl of river at the tidy 
house 31 the marble bank-face of the liquor store 32 
I saw the Negroes driven with pick handles 33 on 
these other jobs I was not in tunnel work. 34 
Between us, love 35 the buses at the door 36 
the long glass street two years, my death to yours 
37 my death upon your lips 38 my face becoming 
glass 39 strong challenged time making me win immortal 40 
the love a mirror of our valley 41 our street 
our river a deadly glass to hold. 42 Now they 
are feeding me into a steel mill furnace 43 O 
love the stream of glass a stream of living fire.
