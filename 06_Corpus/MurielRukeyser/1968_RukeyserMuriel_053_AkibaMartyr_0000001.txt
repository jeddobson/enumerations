1 When his death confronted him, it had the face 
of his friend 2 Rufus the Roman general with his 
claws of pain, 3 His executioner. This was an old 
man under iron rakes 4 Tearing through to the bone. 
He made no cry. 5 After the failure of all 
missions. At ninety, going 6 To Hadrian in Egypt, the 
silver-helmed, 7 Named for a sea. To intercede. Do not 
build in the rebuilt 8 Temple. 9 Your statue, do 
not make it a shrine to you. 10 Antinous smiling. 
Interpreters. This is an old man, pleading. 11 Incense of 
fans. The emperor does not understand. 12 He accepts his 
harvest, failures. He accepts faithlessness, 13 Madness of friends, a 
failed life; and now the face of storm. 14 Does 
the old man during uprising speak for compromise? 15 In 
all but the last things. Not in the study itself. 
16 For this religion is a system of knowledge; 17 
Points may be one by one abandoned, but not the 
study. 18 Does he preach passion and non-violence? 19 Yes, 
and trees, crops, children honestly taught. He says: 20 Prepare 
yourselves for suffering. 21 Now the rule closes in, the 
last things are forbidden. 22 There is no real survival 
without these. 23 Now it is time for prison and 
the unknown. 24 The old man flowers into spiritual fire. 
25 Streaking of agony across the sky. 26 Torn black. 
Red racing on blackness. Dawn. 27 Rufus looks at him 
over the rakes of death 28 Asking, "What is it? 
29 Have you magic powers? Or do you feel no 
pain?" 30 The old man answers, "No. But there is 
a commandment 31 saying 32 Thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart, with all 33 thy 
soul and with all thy might. 34 I knew that 
I loved him with all my heart and might. 35 
Now I know that l love him with all my 
life." 36 The look of delight of the martyr 37 
Among the colors of pain, at last knowing his own 
response 38 Total and unified. 39 To love God with 
all the heart, all passion, 40 Every desire called evil, 
turned toward unity, 41 All the opposites, all in the 
dialogue. 42 All the dark and light of the heart, 
of life made whole. 43 Surpassing the known life, day 
and ideas. 44 My hope, my life, my burst of 
consciousness: 45 To confirm my life in the time of 
confrontation. 46 The old man saying Shema. 47 The death 
of Akiba.
