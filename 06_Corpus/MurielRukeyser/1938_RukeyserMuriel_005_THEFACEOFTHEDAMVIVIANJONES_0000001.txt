1 On the hour he shuts the door and walks 
out of town; 2 he knows the place up the 
gorge where he can see 3 his locomotive rusted on 
the siding, 4 he sits and sees the river at 
his knee. 5 There, where the men crawl, landscaping the 
grounds 6 at the power-plant, he saw the blasts explode 
7 the mouth of the tunnel that opened wider 8 
when precious in the rock the white glass showed. 9 
The old plantation-house (burned to the mud) 10 is a 
hill-acre of ground. The Negro woman throws 11 gay arches 
of water out from the front door. 12 It runs 
down, wild as grass, falls and flows. 13 On the 
quarter he remembers how they enlarged 14 the tunnel and 
the crews, finding the silica, 15 how the men came 
riding freights, got jobs here 16 and went innto the 
tunnel-mouth to stay. 17 Never to be used, he thinks, 
never to spread its power, 18 jinx on the rock, 
curse on the power-plant, 19 hundreds breathed value, filled their 
lungs full of glass 20 (O the gay wind the 
clouds the many men). 21 On the half-hour he's at 
Hawk's Nest over the dam, 22 snow springs up as 
he reaches the great wall-face, 23 immense and pouring power, 
the mist of snow, 24 the fallen mist, the slope 
of water, glass. 25 O the gay snow the white 
dropped water, down, 26 all day the water rushes down 
its river, 27 unused, has done its death-work in the 
country, 28 proud gorge and festive water. 29 On the 
last quarter he pulls his heavy collar up, 30 feels 
in his pocket the picture of his girl, 31 touches 
for luck---he used to as he drove 32 after he 
left his engine; stamps in the deep snow. 33 And 
the snow clears and the dam stands in the gay 
weather, 34 O proud O white O water rolling down, 
35 he turns and stamps this off his mind again 
36 and on the hour walks again through town.
