1 Two on the stairs in a house where they 
had loved : 2 mounting, and the steps a long 
ascent before them 3 brown: a single step creaking high 
in the flight; the turn : 4 the quiet house 
and the cheese-yellow walls shadowed by night, 5 dark; and 
the unlit lamps along the wall. 6 Dusk piles in 
old house-corners rapidly. Shade grows 7 where corners round to 
flights of stairs again. Evening 8 accumulates under the treads 
of mounting stairs. 9 They rise: he tightly-knit, clenched in 
anxiety, she calm, 10 massive in female beauty, precise line 
of brow 11 curving to generous cheek and mouth and 
throat, 12 and his face bright and strained with eagerness. 
13 But the nights are restless with these dreams of 
ours 14 in which we cry, fling our arms abroad, 
and there is no one; 15 walls close in to 
a shaft and blur of brown : 16 out of 
the chaos and eclipse of mind rise stairs. 17 (Here, 
metrically and monotonously walks 18 each several person unprotectedly.) 19 
Alone, the nightmare broadens in the rising, 20 dull step 
sinking behind dull step, now, here, here, 21 nothing in 
the world but the slow spiral rise, expectancy, and fear. 
22 He turns his face to her, walk unbroken. Her 
face 23 questioning turns: there is no help for each 
24 in the other. There are no eyes on them. 
The shaft 25 is empty of voices, all but the 
creaking step, regularly 26 in the flights recurring, preknown, dreaded 
that sound. 27 There is no face that he can 
see but hers. 28 She knows his look, and has 
known it for a long time. 29 The creak of 
the one step is a punctuating rhyme. 30 But the 
nights are restless with receding faces 31 in massed battalions 
through the solemn air, 32 vivid with brightness, clangorous with 
sounds : 33 struck copper, chiming cylinders of silver, horns 
: 34 presences in the outer air. But here 35 
only the empty shaft and the painful stairs. 36 He 
remembers the men and women he has loved: 37 fine-curved 
and brittle skulls housing strange ardency, 38 the male hard 
bravery of argument : 39 lips of women, love-writhen, and 
their hands, 40 pale fruit of comfort, pliant, governing, white 
consolation 41 against small fear and human bodily pain, 42 
never against the terror of the stairs. 43 Remembrances of 
words, human counsel in sounds, and 44 pictures, 45 books, 
and the bleak rush of shining towers, 46 tunes crop 
through the tired brain : Ravel's "Bolero," 47 an old 
blues going "Love, Oh Love, Oh Loveless Love," 48 humping 
through air powerfully with its sound. 49 She remembers the 
men and women she has loved : 50 the full 
soft cheeks of girls, their secrecies, 51 grave words that 
fell with sweet continuance in her 52 youth : 53 
men's eyes, dumb with meaning unspeakable and low- 54 sounding 
55 among the intricate memories deep in her recessed mind, 
56 the length of their arms, the firm triangled backs, 
stalwart, 57 turning beautifully in their planes on the narrow 
hips, 58 dark ease beneath their arms and eyes, strength 
in their 59 voices, 60 but ebbing away in the 
silence of the stairs. 61 Remembrances of wind shaking November 
evenings, 62 arpeggioed skyscrapers, clean-heavy-falling waters : 63 "There's No 
Today, There's No Tomorrow" 64 debates against a symphony of 
Brahms', 65 and foot follows foot heavily in the row. 
66 He had gone to play apart, by the hollows 
of the sand 67 cupped (a pale arm about the 
ocean's blue) : 68 picked pebbles and the soft-voluted shells, 
69 laver and dulse, dark flowers of the sea. 70 
He had been a child in a fantastic wood 71 
where the dim statues stood, posturing gothically, 72 and "Mother, 
mother, mother!" cried : but they 73 remained with closed 
lips ceremonially. 74 The ocean and his mother and his 
childhood let him be 75 until he had grown and 
finished his lessons and his 76 prayers, 77 and then 
: these stairs. 78 Night is treacherous with dreams betraying 
us, 79 leaving us vulnerable to inherited shame, 80 crying 
out against our secret, naming an occult name. 81 And 
she had enjoyed narrow fields, shaven lawns, 82 tiny stones 
freckled brown and white and red, 83 green water troubled 
by waves of a twig's making, 84 grown out of 
these to wider thoughts that bred 85 high spaces and 
new knowledges, and cared for some 86 with mind and 
body, some with love only of eyes and head. 87 
She had believed in the quick response to pain, 88 
in union of crowds living in one belief, 89 a 
social order kept by a co√∂perative strain 90 steadily toward 
one thing, but aware of all : 91 she had 
reached out her hand with the gesture of one who 
dares, 92 and found : these stairs. 93 The stairs 
still rise. The halls remain, and dull 94 and somber 
stand to be trodden by the quiet two rising 95 
laboriously along the fateful road. They should be high now. 
96 (If the dun walls should slide into the night, 
97 faces might be disclosed, bitter, impotent, angered 98 above 
slant shoulders swinging toolless arms, great hands 99 jointed around 
no implements, and the silent mouths 100 opened to cry 
for law. Some faces black, the rope 101 knotted beneath 
an ear, some black with the strong blood 102 of 
Negroes, some yellow and concentrate, all fixed 103 on the 
tower of stairs, should the walls sink, perhaps 104 all 
waiting, perhaps nothing but unanswering dark.) 105 They must be 
high. There are no voices. The shaft 106 is very 
still. 107 Night is sick with our dreams. Night is 
florid 108 with our by-reason-uncontested imagings. We in our time 
109 (not we : you : in your time :
