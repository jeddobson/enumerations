1 All of the people of the play were there, 
2 swam in the mile-long wave, among cliff-flowers 3 were 
pierced, hung and remembered a sunlit year.4 By day white 
moths, the nightlong meteors 5 flying like snow among the 
flowery trees--- 6 hissing like prophecy above those seas.7 The 
city of the past. The past as a city 8 
and all the people in it, your childhood faces, 9 
their dances, their words developing, their hands.10 The fertile season 
ending in a glitter; 11 blight of the forest, orange, 
burning the trees away, 12 the checkered light. Full length 
on naked sand.13 All of the people of the play 
were there, 14 smiling, telling their truths, coming to crisis. 
15 This water, this water, this water. These rocks, this 
piercing 16 sea.17 Flower of time, and a plague of 
white trilling in sunlight, 18 the season advancing on the 
people of the play, 19 the scars on the mountains 
and the body of fire.
