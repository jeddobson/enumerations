1 Until I stand on the January platform 2 (Bunting 
and boards), Connecticut Avenue 3 That lowcut archway into the 
histories. 4 Speaking the inaugurals of these same young men, 
5 Declaring a specific amnesty. 6 Then, eighteen miles apart, 
the muscular young 7 Arrogant fools, the founders of our 
future 8 With their ideas of freedom as relation 9 
To human process, will push their shoulderblades 10 Against their 
treetrunks 11 And rear, like a tidal wave upon Peru. 
12 Some fool with space on his left hand and 
his right 13 Will stare down-track. 14 The free, watery, 
liquid rails 15 Will seal our fire across the seamless 
land, 16 Fusing, fusing. Fusing 17 A new age. 18 
The streaming hours of man, 19 The plant spread to 
the green sun. 20 That's what it'll take; not anything 
like these 21 Seven long years of Washington afternoons, 22 
Shaking official syllables out of my creases : 23 Pork-barrel 
and candy-stick.
