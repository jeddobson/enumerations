1 This is the most audacious landscape. The gangster's 2 
stance with his gun smoking and out is not so 
3 vicious as this commercial field, its hill of glass. 
4 Sloping as gracefully as thighs, the foothills 5 narrow 
to this, clouds over every town 6 finally indicate the 
stored destruction. 7 Crystalline hill: a blinded field of white 
8 murdering snow, seamed by convergent tracks; 9 the travelling 
cranes reach for the silica. 10 And down the track, 
the overhead conveyor 11 slides on its cable to the 
feet of chimneys. 12 Smoke rises, not white enough, not 
so barbaric. 13 Here the severe flame speaks from the 
brick throat, 14 electric furnaces produce this precious, this clean, 
15 annealing the crystals, fusing at last alloys. 16 Hottest 
for silicon, blast furnaces raise flames, 17 spill fire, spill 
steel, quench the new shape to freeze, 18 tempering it 
to perfected metal. 19 Forced through this crucible, a million 
men. 20 Above this pasture, the highway passes those 21 
who curse the air, breathing their fear again. 22 The 
roaring flowers of the chimney-stacks 23 less poison, at their 
lips in fire, than this 24 dust that is blown 
from off the field of glass; 25 blows and will 
blow, rising over the mills, 26 crystallized and beyond the 
fierce corrosion 27 disintegrated angel on these hills.
