1 Green going through the jungle of those years 2 
I see the brilliant bodies of the invaders 3 And 
the birds cry in the high trees, the sky 4 
Flashes above me in bright crevices; time is, 5 And 
I go on and the birds fly blurred 6 And 
I pass, my eyes seeing through corpses of dead cells 
7 Glassy, a world hardening with my hardening eyes 8 
My look is through the corpses of all the living 
9 Men and women who stood with me and died 
before 10 But my young look still blazes from my 
changing 11 Eyes and the jungle asserts fiery green 12 
Even though the trees are the trees of home 13 
And we look out of eyes filled with dead cells 
14 See through these hours, faces of what we are.
