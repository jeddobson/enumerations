1 When a magnet is 2 struck by a hammer 
3 the magnetism spills out of 4 the iron. 5 
The molecules 6 are jarred, 7 they are a mob 
going 8 in all directions 9 The magnet is 10 
shock√©d back 11 it is no magnet but 12 simple 
iron. 13 There is no more 14 of its former 
15 kind of accord 16 or force. 17 But if 
you take 18 another magnet 19 and stroke the iron 
20 with this, 21 it can be 22 remagnetized 23 
if you stroke it, 24 and stroke it, 25 stroke 
it 26 stroke it, 27 the molecules 28 can be 
given 29 their tending grace 30 by a strong magnet 
31 stroking stroking 32 always in the same direction, 33 
of course.
