1 Sounds of night in the country of the opposites. 
2 Music for the first time, on incredible instruments: 3 
The rapids of a river, a woman's kitchen stove, 4 
A village crossroads with its forgotten language; 5 Clank and 
chuckle of gambling; one line of a song; 6 The 
strings of lost limitless time. Music. 7 Voice of a 
cat you knew before you learned to speak. 8 Voices 
of waterfalls, steel whirls, many small flowers, 9 Voices of 
a dream of the animals of heaven 10 Raised through 
the hungering 11 Of some one thin wavering unransomed boy 
12 In starved and golden air. 13 A sheer black 
music, rare-lit joining of waters. 14 Night-sound in the country 
of the opposites.
