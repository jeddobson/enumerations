assurance and flowing with reward. 224 The seeds of answering 
are in their voice. 225 The spirit lives, against the 
time's disease. 226 You little children, come down out of 
your mothers 227 And tell us about peace. 228 I 
hear the singing of the lives of women, 229 The 
clear mystery, the offering and pride. 230 But here also 
the orange lights of a bar, and an 231 Old 
biddy singing inside: 232 Rain and tomorrow more 233 They 
say there will be rain 234 They lean together and 
tell 235 The sorrow of the loin. 236 Telling each 
other, saying 237 "But can you understand?" 238 They recount 
separate sorrows. 239 Throat. Forehead. Hand. 240 On the bars 
and walls of buildings 241 They passed when they were 
young 242 They vomit out their pain, 243 The sorrow 
of the lung. 244 Who would suspect it of women? 
245 They have not any rest. 246 Sad dreams of 
the belly, of the lip, 247 Of the deep warm 
breast. 248 All sorrows have their place in flesh, 249 
All flesh will with its sorrow die--- 250 All but 
the patch of sunlight over, 251 Over the sorrowful sunlit 
eye.252 Surely it is time for the true grace of 
women 253 Emerging, in their lives' colors, from the rooms, 
from the 254 harvests, 255 From the delicate prisons, to 
speak their promises. 256 The spirit's dreaming delight and the 
fluid senses' 257 Involvement in the world. Surely the day's 
beginning 258 In midnight, in time of war, flickers upon 
the wind. 259 O on the wasted midnight of our 
pain 260 Remember the wasted ones, lost as surely as 
soldiers 261 Surrendered to the barbarians, gone down under centuries 
262 Of the starved spirit, in desperate mortal midnight 263 
With the pure throats and cries of blessing, the clearest 
264 Fountains of mercy and continual love. 265 These years 
know separation. O the future shining 266 In far countries 
or suddenly at home in a look, in a season, 
267 In music freeing a new myth among the male 
268 Steep landscapes, the familiar cliffs, trees, towers 269 That 
stand and assert the earth, saying: "Come here, come to 
me. 270 Here are your children." Not as traditional man 
271 But love's great insight---"your children and your song." 272 
Coming close to the source of belief, these have created 
273 Resistance, the flowering fire of memory, 274 Given the 
bread and the dance and the breathing midnight. 275 Nothing 
has been begun. No peace, no word of marvellous 276 
Possible hillsides, the warm lips of the living 277 Who 
fought for the spirit's grace among despair, 278 Beginning with 
signs of belief, offered in time of war, 279 As 
I now send you, for a beginning, praise.
