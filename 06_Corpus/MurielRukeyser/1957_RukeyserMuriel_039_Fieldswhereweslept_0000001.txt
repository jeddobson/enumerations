1 Fields where we slept 2 Lie underwater now 3 
Clay meadows of nightmare 4 Beneath the shallow wave. 5 
A tremor of speech 6 On all lips and all 
mirrors; 7 Pink sweater and tornado 8 Act out the 
spiral dawn. 9 South lies evocative 10 On one fine 
Negro mouth. 11 Play of silver in streams 12 Half 
lake under. 13 High on the unplowed red 14 And 
waterweeds respond, 15 Where Sheriff Fever 16 Ordered me to 
trial. 17 Where once hatred and fear 18 Touched me 
the branch of death, 19 I may float waves of 
making 20 Hung above my lost field. 21 Remember they 
say and Incarnatus Est, 22 The fire-tailed waves, never forget 
the eyes 23 Of the distorted jailers or their kindness 
24 Even while they were torturing Mr. Crystal. 25 Psalms 
awake and asleep, remember the manmade 26 Lake where those 
barren treecrowns rode. 27 Where air of curses hung, keel 
of my calm 28 Rides our created tide.
