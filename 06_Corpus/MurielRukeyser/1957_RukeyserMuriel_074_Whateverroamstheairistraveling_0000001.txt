1 Whatever roams the air is traveling 2 Over these 
griefs, these wars and this good. 3 Whatever cries and 
flowers, lives and can farther find 4 Than the threshold 
of sense; I know the piercing name; 5 Among all 
the silence, in pain, the birth-cry came. 6 Salt of 
these tears whitens my eyelashes. 7 Whatever ploughs the land 
turns into food: 8 Before my face, flowers, color which 
is form. 9 Bravery ploughs the season, turns to birth 
10 Upon the sex-sown people-flowering earth. 11 A year turns 
in its crisis. In its sleep. 12 Whatever ploughs our 
dreams is ours to keep. 13 Whatever ploughs our dreams 
is ours to give: 14 The threshold rises and changes. 
15 I give, I perceive; 16 Here are the gifts 
of day risen at last; 17 Blood of desire, the 
riding of belief 18 Beyond our fury and our silences.
