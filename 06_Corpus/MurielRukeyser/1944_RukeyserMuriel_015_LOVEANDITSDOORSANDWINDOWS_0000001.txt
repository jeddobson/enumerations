1 History melts my houses, 2 But they were all 
one house 3 Where in the dark beginning 4 A 
tall and maniac nurse 5 Hid tortures behind the door 
6 And afterwards kissed me 7 Promising all as before. 
8 The second house was music; 9 The childish hands 
of fear 10 Lying on a piano 11 That was 
blackness and light, 12 Opened my life with sound--- 13 
Extorting promises 14 Loud in the ringing air. 15 After 
that, broken houses, 16 The wealthy halls of cloud 17 
Haunted by living parents 18 And the possessive face. 19 
Power and outrage looking 20 At the great river 21 
Marvellous filthy and gold. 22 When love lay in my 
arms 23 I all night kissed that mouth, 24 And 
the incredible body 25 Slept warm at my side; 26 
But the walls fell apart 27 Among my lifetime dream--- 
28 O, a voice said crying, 29 My mother's broken 
heart. 30 Nothing was true in the sense 31 I 
wanted it to be true. 32 Victory came late, 33 
Excitement returned too soon. 34 If my love were for 
the dead, 35 Desire would restore 36 Me to my 
life again. 37 My love is for the living; 38 
They point me down to death, 39 And death I 
will not take. 40 My promises have grown, 41 My 
kiss was never false, 42 The faint clear-colored walls 43 
Are not forever down.
