1 Lilienthal said : I heard him saying words like 
these. 2 Almost like these words: 3 My convictions are 
not so much against, as for. 4 I believe---and I 
conceive law to rest here, as does religion--- 5 The 
fundamental truth, the integrity of the individual; 6 That all 
we build be designed to promote and protect and 7 
defend 8 The integrity and the dignity of the individual. 
9 This the essential meaning of our nation, 10 As 
it is essentially the meaning of religion. 11 Any forms, 
then, which make men means rather than ends, 12 Which 
exalt any institution above the importance of men, 13 Which 
rest on an arbitrary power over men, 14 Are contrary 
to that conception and my meaning. 15 That I deeply 
oppose, and I deeply disbelieve. 16 Out of this central 
core of a belief 17 That all men are the 
children of God 18 That their lives come first and 
are sacred, 19 A great belief grows in civil liberties, 
20 In their protection; a repugnance to theft 21 Of 
these liberties and a human being's good name, 22 By 
innuendo or by open lies. 23 Here is no ethical 
standard, nor in the state 24 Which exercises blind powers 
over the human heart. 25 Occasionally, all these things are 
done 26 In the name of democracy. 27 They can 
tear our people apart. 28 I believe in the capacity 
of our central belief 29 To survive its trials provided 
only we 30 Practice, in daily life, daily, our truths. 
31 They are affirmative. That is their hope in this 
world. 32 This I deeply believe.
