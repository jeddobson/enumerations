1 An Idea ran about the world 2 screaming with 
the pain of the mind 3 until it met a 
child 4 who stopped it with a word. 5 The 
Idea leaned over those newborn eyes 6 and dreamed of 
the nature of things: 7 the nature of memory and 
the nature of love; 8 and forgave itself and all 
men. 9 Quieted in a sea of sleeping 10 the 
Idea began its long return--- 11 renewed by the child's 
sea-colored eyes 12 remembered the flesh, smiled and said: 13 
I see birds, spring and the birthplace 14 unknown by 
the stable stone. 15 I know light and I know 
motion 16 and I remember I am not alone. 17 
The Idea voyaged nearer my breathing, saying 18 Come balance 
come 19 into the love of these faces and forces 
20 find us our equilibrium. 21 And the child stirred, 
asking his questions. 22 The Idea grew more fleshly and 
spoke: 23 Beaten down I was 24 Down I knew 
very long 25 Newborn I begin. 26 And the child 
went on asking his questions. 27 The Idea journeying into 
my body 28 returned, and I knew the nature of 
One, 29 and could forget One, and turn to the 
child, 30 and whole could turn to the world again. 
31 Until the pain turns into answers 32 And all 
the masters become askers 33 And all the victims again 
doers 34 And all the sources break in light. 35 
The child goes alive, asking his questions.
