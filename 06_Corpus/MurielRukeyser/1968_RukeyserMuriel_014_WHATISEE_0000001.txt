1 Lie there, in sweat and dream, I do, and 
"there" 2 Is here, my bed, on which I dream 
3 You, lying there, on yours, locked, pouring love, 4 
While I tormented here see in my reins 5 You, 
perfectly at climax. And the lion strikes. 6 I want 
you with whatever obsessions come--- 7 I wanted your obsession 
to be mine 8 But if it is that unknown 
half-suggested strange 9 Other figure locked in your climax, then 
10 I here, I want you and the other, want 
your obsession, want 11 Whatever is locked into you now 
while I sweat and dream.
