1 Wary of time O it seizes the soul tonight 
2 I wait for the great morning of the west 
3 confessing with every breath mortality. 4 Moon of this 
wild sky struggles to stay whole 5 and on the 
water silvers the ships of war. 6 I go alone 
in the black-yellow light 7 all night waiting for day, 
while everywhere the sure 8 death of light, the leaf's 
sure return to the root 9 is repeated in million, 
death of all man to share. 10 Whatever world I 
know shines ritual death, 11 wide under this moon they 
stand gathering fire, 12 fighting with flame, stand fighting in 
their graves. 13 All shining with life as the leaf, 
as the wing shines, 14 the stone deep in the 
mountain, the drop in the green wave. 15 Lit by 
their energies, secretly, all things shine. 16 Nothing can black 
that glow of life; although 17 each part go crumbling 
down 18 itself shall rise up whole. 19 Now I 
say there are new meanings; now I name 20 death 
our black honor and feast of possibility 21 to celebrate 
casting of life on life. This earth-long day 22 between 
blood and resurrection where we wait 23 remembering sun, seed, 
fire; remembering 24 that fierce Judaean Innocent who risked 25 
every immortal meaning on one life. 26 Given to our 
year as sun and spirit are, 27 as seed we 
are blessed only in needing freedom. 28 Now I say 
that the peace the spirit needs is peace, 29 not 
lack of war, but fierce continual flame. 30 For all 
men : effort is freedom, effort's peace, 31 it fights. 
And along these truths the soul goes home, 32 flies 
in its blazing to a place 33 more safe and 
round than Paradise. 34 Night of the soul, our dreams 
in the arms of dreams 35 dissolving into eyes that 
look upon us. 36 Dreams the sources of action, the 
meeting and the end, 37 a resting-place among the flight 
of things. 38 And love which contains all human spirit, 
all wish, 39 the eyes and hands, sex, mouth, hair, 
the whole woman--- 40 fierce peace I say at last, 
and the sense of the world. 41 In the time 
of conviction of mortality 42 whatever survive, I remember what 
I am.--- 43 The nets of this night are on 
fire with sun and moon 44 pouring both lights into 
the open tomb. 45 Whatever arise, it comes in the 
shape of peace, 46 fierce peace which is love, in 
which move all the stars, 47 and the breathing of 
universes, filling, falling away, 48 and death on earth cast 
into the human dream. 49 What fire survive forever 50 
myself is for my time.
