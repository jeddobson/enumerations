1 We are the seas through whom the great fish 
passed 2 And passes. He died in a moment of 
general dying. 3 Something was reborn. What was it, Pablo? 
4 Something is being reborn : poems, death, ourselves, 5 
The link deep in our peoples, the dead link in 
our dead 6 regimes, 7 The last of our encounters 
transformed from the first 8 Long ago in Xavier's house, 
where you lay sick, 9 Speaking of poems, the sheet 
pushed away 10 Growth of beard pressing up, fierce grass, 
as you spoke. 11 And that last moment in the 
hall of students, 12 Speaking at last of Spain, that 
core of all our lives, 13 The long defeat that 
brings us what we know. 14 Meaning, poems, lifelong in 
loss and presence passing forever. 15 I spilled the wine 
at the table 16 And you, Pablo, dipped your finger 
in it and marked my 17 forehead. 18 Words, blood, 
rivers, cities, days. I go, a woman signed by 19 
you--- 20 The poems of the wine.
