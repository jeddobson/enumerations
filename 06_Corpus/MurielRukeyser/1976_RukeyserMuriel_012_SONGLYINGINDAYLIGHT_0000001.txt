1 Lying in daylight, in the strong 2 light of 
all our fantasies, 3 now touch speaking to touch, touch 
sees--- 4 night and light, the darkness-stare, 5 your long 
look that pierces where 6 light never came till now--- 
7 moving is what we do, 8 moving we are, 
searching, 9 going high and underground, 10 rain behind rain 
pouring down, 11 river under river going 12 silence on 
silence 13 sound under sound.
