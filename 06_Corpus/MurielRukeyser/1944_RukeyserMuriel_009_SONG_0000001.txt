1 The world is full of loss; bring, wind, my 
love, 2 My home is where we make our meeting-place, 
3 And love whatever I shall touch and read 4 
Within that face. 5 Lift, wind, my exile from my 
eyes; 6 Peace to look, life to listen and confess, 
7 Freedom to find to find to find 8 That 
nakedness.
