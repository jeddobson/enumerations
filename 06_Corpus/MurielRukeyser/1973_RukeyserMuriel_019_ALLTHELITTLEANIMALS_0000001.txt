1 "You are not pregnant," said the man 2 with 
the probe and the while white coat; 3 "Yes she 
is," said all the little animals. 4 Then the great 
gynecologist examined. "You are not now, and 5 I doubt 
that you ever have been," he said with authority. 6 
"Test me again." He looked at his nurse and shrugged. 
7 "Yes she is," said all the little animals, and 
laid down their 8 lives for my son and me. 
9 Twenty-one years late, my son a grown man and 
far away at 10 the other ocean, 11 I hear 
them : "Yes you are," say all the little animals. 
12 I see them, they move in great jumping procession 
through my 13 waking hours, 14 those frogs and rabbits 
look at me with their round eyes, they 15 kick 
powerfully with their strong hind legs, 16 they lay down 
their lives in silence, 17 all the rabbits saying Yes, 
all the frogs saying Yes, 18 in the face of 
all men and all institutions, 19 all the doctors, all 
the parents, all the worldly friends, all the 20 psychiatrists, 
all the abortionists, alll the lawyers. 21 The little animals 
whom I bless and praise and thank forever, 22 they 
are part of my living, 23 go leap through my 
waking and my sleep, go leap through my 24 life 
and my birth-giving and my death. 25 go leap through 
my dreams. 26 and my son's life 27 and whatever 
streams from him.
