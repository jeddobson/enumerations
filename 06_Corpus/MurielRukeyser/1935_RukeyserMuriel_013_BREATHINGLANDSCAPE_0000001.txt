1 Lying in the sun 2 and lying here so 
still 3 an egg might slowly hatch in this still 
hand. 4 The people pass 5 abruptly they nod : 
they smile 6 trailed in the air, silence follows their 
faces. 7 I know, lying 8 how the hills are 
fixed 9 and the day-moon runs at the head of 
the fixed hills. 10 Nothing crossed the field 11 all 
day a bird 12 skirting the tall grass in briefest 
transit. 13 Their stern ideas 14 are a long work 
to each 15 and even armored we hardly touch each 
other. 16 The wind leans, 17 the air placed formally 
18 about these faces and thoughts in formal dance. 19 
Silence hangs in the air. 20 Nothing speaks but the 
sound 21 of certain rivers continuing underground.
