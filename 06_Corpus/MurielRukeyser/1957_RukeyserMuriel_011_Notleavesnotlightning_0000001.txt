1 Not leaves, not lightning, not that greatness of rivers. 
2 The woman who sees herself in her lifetime, moving, 
3 The man at work who uses the valleys 4 
And still sustains the valleys. 5 The water-spiral turns the 
fire 6 That breaks upon the miles of air, 7 
Leaps through the furnaces of change 8 To make and 
make. From those steel pools 9 The healing of earth 
is given a man. 10 He rides his pastures to 
the sun, 11 The great sun pours hot power down 
12 To feed the feeding mouths, to bind 13 Earth 
to earth and man to man, 14 Until earth stores 
the waters up 15 To course the water-spiral new, 16 
Whirlpool and embryo.
