1 How horrible late spring is, with the full death 
of the frozen 2 tight bulbs 3 brownly rotting in 
earth; and each chord of light 4 rayed into slivers, 
a bunch of grapes plucked grape by grape 5 apart, 
6 a warm chord broken into the chilled single notes. 
7 (Let us rely on cerebral titillation 8 for the 
red stimulus of sensuous supply;) 9 here is no heat, 
no fierce color: spring is no bacchante this year 10 
eager to celebrate her carnal dedication. 11 The ghosts swim, 
lipless, eyeless, upward : 12 the crazy hands point in 
five directions down : 13 to the sea, the high 
ridge, the bush, the blade, the weak white 14 root 
: 15 thumping at life in an agony of birth, 
abortive fruit. 16 Spring is very mad for greenness now 
17 ( : I suppose it would be beautiful, if 
we let ourselves be : ), 18 but we must 
strip nascent earth bare of green mystery. 19 Trees do 
not grow high as skyscrapers in my town, 20 and 
flowers not so lovely as the pale bewildered youth, 21 
hands pointing in five directions upward and out; 22 and 
spring in the fields and cities spreads to the north 
and 23 south, 24 and is comforted in desire for 
the sun's mouth. 25 Earth does not seem wooden to 
the comforted spring : 26 (spring could not seem so 
dull, I comforted : 27 but there must be abstraction, 
where fields need not sprout, 28 waves pound, 29 there 
must be silence where no rushing grasses sound, 30 life 
in this lack of death, comfort on this wide ground).
