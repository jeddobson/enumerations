1 PAUL: Miss Lorence, you are a tree with leaves 
on, 2 A strong stone, a brook. Look, 3 Water 
running in brooks, in brooks, in brooks, 4 Which are 
purple and white streams, 5 Screens, screams and cries and 
loud noises. 6 Oh, what a singer am I. 7 
Little songs and cries. 8 I want to want to 
want to get up. 9 But I will sing a 
loo a loo a loo. 10 The old man named 
Loo 11 And he went to an eye 12 And 
he lived in the eye. 13 What a lot he 
could see. 14 Once upon a time 15 There was 
an end of my story. 16 I do not like 
the black sky.
