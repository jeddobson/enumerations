1 A time of destruction. Of the most rigid powers 
in ascendance. 2 Secret plots against them, open work against 
them in round 3 buildings. 4 All fail. Any work 
for fluency, for freedom, fails. 5 Battles. The wiping out 
of cities full of people. 6 Long tracts of devastation. 
7 In one city : a scene of refugees, each 
allowed to take 8 a suitcase of bedding, blankets, no 
more. An old man, a professor. 9 He has hidden 
a few books and two small statues in a blanket 
10 and packed his case. He comes in his turn 
to the examining desk. 11 He struggles about the lie 
he needs to tell. He lies, he declares 12 nothing. 
13 Even after the lie, the suitcase is thrown over 
the cliff 14 where all the statues lie broken, the 
books, pictures, the records. 15 Long landscapes of devastation. Color 
modulated between 16 sparse rigid monuments. Long orange landscapes 17 
shifting to yellow-orange to show a generation. 18 Long passage 
of time to yellow. Only these elite, 19 their army 
tread on yellow terrain. Their schools. Their 20 children. 21 
A tradition of rigor, hatred and doom is now 22 
---generations after---the only sole tradition. 23 I am looking at 
the times and time as at a dream. 24 As 
at the recurrent dream of a locked room. 25 I 
think of the solution of the sealed room mystery 26 
of the chicken and the egg, in which the chicken 
27 feeds on his cell, grows strong on the sealed 
room 28 and finally 29 in strength 30 eating his 
prison 31 pierces the shell. 32 How can this room 
change state? 33 I see its sky, its children. I 
cannot imagine. 34 I look at the young faces of 
the children 35 in this tradition, far down the colors 
of the years. 36 They are still repeating their shut 
slogans 37 with "war" substituted for freedom. But their faces 
glow. 38 The children are marvelous, singing among the wars. 
39 They have needed the meanings, and their faces show 
40 this : the solution. 41 The words have taken 
on 42 all their forbidden meanings. The words mean their 
opposites. 43 They must, they are needed. 44 Children's faces, 
lit, unlit, 45 the face of a child.
