1 PAUL: Miss Lorence, until I get to be somebody 
else---big me--- 2 I'm Timmy Torin. 3 My horse at 
home is not really a real horse. 4 I told 
you that a time ago. It is not true. 5 
I love to tell you things. Some are real, 6 
Some are not, just fooling. 7 You don't mind? I 
wouldn't, except that I'm older than you 8 and bigger 
than you and I can do it. Big people do. 
9 You know, I certainly do like Ropsie in that 
little, little skirt 10 with her fat legs out. 11 
I'll take care of you, Miss Lorence. 12 Just tell 
you things sometimes, 13 Fooling.
