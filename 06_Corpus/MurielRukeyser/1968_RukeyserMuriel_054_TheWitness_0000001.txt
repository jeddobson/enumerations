1 Who is the witness? What voice moves across time, 
2 Speaks for the life and death as witness voice? 
3 Moving tonight on this city, this river, my winter 
street? 4 He saw it, the one witness. Tonight the 
life as legend 5 Goes building a meeting for me 
in the veins of night 6 Adding its scenes and 
its songs. Here is the man transformed, 7 The tall 
shepherd, the law, the false messiah, all; 8 You who 
come after me far from tonight finding 9 These lives 
that ask you always Who is the witness--- 10 Take 
from us acts of encounter we at night 11 Wake 
to attempt, as signs, seeds of beginning, 12 Given from 
darkness and remembering darkness, 13 Take from our light given 
to you our meetings. 14 Time tells us men and 
women, tells us You 15 The witness, your moment covered 
with signs, your self. 16 Tells us this moment, saying 
You are the meeting. 17 You are made of signs, 
your eyes and your song. 18 Your dance the dance, 
the walk into the present. 19 All this we are 
and accept, being made of signs, speaking 20 To you, 
in time not yet born. 21 The witness is myself. 
22 And you, 23 The signs, the journeys of the 
night, survive.
