1 Deeper than sleep but not so deep as death 
2 I lay there sleeping and my magic head 3 
remembered and forgot. On first cry I 4 remembered and 
forgot and did believe. 5 I knew love and I 
knew evil: 6 woke to the burning song and the 
tree burning blind, 7 despair of our days and the 
calm milk-giver who 8 knows sleep, knows growth, the sex 
of fire and grass, 9 and the black snake with 
gold bones. 10 Black sleeps, gold burns; on second cry 
I woke 11 fully and gave to feed and fed 
on feeding. 12 Gold seed, green pain, my wizards in 
the earth 13 walked through the house, black in the 
morning dark. 14 Shadows grew in my veins, my bright 
belief, 15 my head of dreams deeper than night and 
sleep. 16 Voices of all black animals crying to drink, 
17 cries of all birth arise, simple as we, 18 
found in the leaves, in clouds and dark, in dream, 
19 deep as this hour, ready again to sleep.
