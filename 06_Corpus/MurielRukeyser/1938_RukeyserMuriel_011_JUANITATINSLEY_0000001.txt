1 Even after the letters, there is work, 2 sweaters, 
the food, the shoes 3 and afternoon's quick dark 4 
draws on the windowpane 5 my face, the shadowed hair, 
6 the scattered papers fade. 7 Slow letters! I shall 
be 8 always---the stranger said 9 "To live stronger and 
free." 10 I know in America there are songs, 11 
forgetful ballads to be sung, 12 but at home I 
see this wrong. 13 When I see my family house, 
14 the gay gorge, the picture-books, 15 they raise the 
face of General Wise 16 aged by enemies, like faces 
17 the stranger showed me in the town. 18 I 
saw that plain, and saw my place. 19 The scene 
of hope's ahead; look, April, 20 and next month with 
a softer wind, 21 maybe they'll rest upon their land, 
22 and then maybe the happy song, and love, 23 
a tall boy who was never in a tunnel.
