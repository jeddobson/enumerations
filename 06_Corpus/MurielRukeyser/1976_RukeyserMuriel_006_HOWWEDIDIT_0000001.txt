1 We all traveled into that big room, 2 some 
from very far away 3 we smiled at some we 
knew 4 we did not as we talked agree 5 
our hearts went fast thinking of morning 6 when we 
would walk along the path. 7 We spoke. Late night. 
We disagreed. 8 We knew we would climb the Senate 
steps. 9 We knew we would present our claim 10 
we would demand : be strong now : end the 
war. 11 How would we do it? What would we 
ask? 12 "We will be warned," one said. "They will 
warn us and take us." 13 "We can speak and 
walk away." 14 "We can lie down as if in 
mourning." 15 "We can lie down as a way of 
speech, 16 speaking of all the dead in Asia." 17 
Then Eqbal said, "We are not at this moment 18 
a revolutionary group, we are 19 a group of dissenters. 
Let some, then, 20 walk away, let some stand until 
they want to leave, 21 let some lie down and 
let some be arrested. Some of us. 22 Let each 
do what he feels at that moment 23 tomorrow." Eqbal's 
dark face. 24 The doctor spoke, of friendships made in 
jail. 25 We looked into each other's eyes 26 and 
went all to our rooms, to sleep, 27 waiting for 
morning.
