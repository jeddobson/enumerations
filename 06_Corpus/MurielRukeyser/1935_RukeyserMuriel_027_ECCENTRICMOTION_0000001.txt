1 Dashing in glass we race, 2 New York to 
Washington : 3 encased with bubbles lie 4 in emerald 
spa : 5 upholstered promenades 6 convey us far. 7 
Have we reached the last limits? 8 What have we 
not done? 9 Shut into velvet we 10 survey the 
scene, 11 the locked-up building, 12 the frozen pier : 
13 before and before the events, 14 we loved our 
minds in fear : 15 they wriggle into worms. 16 
We watch. We turn. Surrounded, 17 we are at last 
closed in. 18 Coated in learning, do we 19 cause 
its crown to fall? 20 the plane, the bath, the 
car 21 extend our protection : 22 (But have we 
seen it all? 23 Shall we continue 24 in this 
direction? : ) 25 This is not the way 26 
to save the day. 27 Get up and dress and 
go 28 go nobly to and fro : 29 Dashing 
in glass we race, 30 New York to Mexico .
