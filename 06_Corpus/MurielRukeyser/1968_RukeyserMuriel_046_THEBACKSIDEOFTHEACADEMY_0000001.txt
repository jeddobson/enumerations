1 Five brick panels, three small windows, six lions' heads 
with 2 rings in their mouths, five pairs of closed 
bronze doors--- 3 the shut wall with the words carved 
across its head 4 ART REMAINS THE ONE WAY POSSIBLE 
OF SPEAKING 5 TRUTH.--- 6 On this May morning, light 
swimming in this street, the 7 children running, 8 on 
the church beside the Academy the lines are flying 9 
of little yellow-and-white plastic flags flapping in the light; 10 
and on the great shut wall, the words are carved 
across: 11 WE ARE YOUNG AND WE ARE FRIENDS OF 
TIME.--- 12 Below that, a light blue asterisk in chalk 
13 and in white chalk, Hector, Joey, Lynn, Rudolfo. 14 
A little up the street, a woman shakes a small 
dark boy, 15 she shouts What's wrong with you, ringing 
that bell! 16 In the street of rape and singing, 
poems, small robberies, 17 carved in an oblong panel of 
the stone: 18 CONSCIOUS UTTERANCE OF THOUGHT BY SPEECH 19 
OR ACTION 20 TO ANY END IS ART.--- 21 On 
the lowest reach of the walls are chalked the words: 
Jack is 22 a object, 23 Walter and Trina, Goo 
Goo, I love Trina, 24 and further along Viva Fidel 
now altered to Muera Fidel. 25 A deep blue marble 
is lodged against the curb. 26 A phone booth on 
one corner; on the other, the big mesh 27 basket 
for trash. 28 Beyond them, the little park is always 
locked. For the two 29 soldier brothers. 30 and past 
that goes on an eternal football game 31 which sometimes, 
as on this day in May, transforms to 32 stickball 
33 as, for one day in May, 34 five pairs 
of closed bronze doors will open 35 and the Academy 
of writers, sculptors, painters, composers, 36 their guests and publishers 
will all roll in and 37 the wave of organ 
music come rolling out into 38 the street where light 
now blows and papers and little children 39 and words, 
some breezes of Spanish blow and many 40 colors of 
people. 41 A watch cap lies fallen against a cellophane 
which used to hold 42 pistachio nuts 43 and here 
before me, on my street, 44 five brick panels, three 
small windows, six lions' heads 45 with rings in their 
mouths, five pairs of closed bronze doors, 46 light flooding 
the street I live and write in; and across the 
river 47 the one word FREE against the ferris wheel 
and the roller 48 coaster, 49 and here, painted upon 
the stones, Chino, Bobby, Joey, Fat- 50 moma, Willy, Holy 
of God 51 and also Margaret is a shit and 
also fuck and shit; 52 far up, invisible at the 
side of the building: 53 WITHOUT VISION THE PEO 54 
and on the other side, the church side, 55 where 
shadows of trees and branches, this day in May, are 
56 printed balanced on the church wall, 57 in-focus trunks 
and softened-focus branches 58 below the roof where the two 
structures stand, 59 bell and cross, antenna and weathervane, 60 
I can see past the church the words of an 
ending line: 61 IVE BY BREAD ALONE.
