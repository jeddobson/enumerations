1 After you finish your work 2 after you do 
your day 3 after you're read your reading 4 after 
you've written your say --- 5 you go down the 
street to the hot dog stand, 6 one block down 
and across the way. 7 On a blistering afternoon in 
East Harlem in the twentieth 8 century 9 Most of 
the windows are boarded up, 10 the rats run out 
of a sack --- 11 sticking out of the crummy 
garage 12 one shiny long Cadillac; 13 at the glass 
door of the drug-addiction center, 14 a man who'd like 
to break your back. 15 But here's a brown woman 
with a little girl dressed in rose and 16 pink, 
too. 17 Frankfurters frankfurters sizzle on the steel 18 where 
the hot-dog-man leans --- 19 nothing else on the counter 
20 but the usual two machines, 21 the grape one, 
empty, and the orange one, empty, 22 I face him 
in between. 23 A black boy comes along, looks at 
the hot dogs, goes on 24 walking. 25 I watch 
the man as he stands and pours 26 in the 
familiar shape 27 bright purple in the one marked ORANGE 
28 orange in the one marked GRAPE, 29 the grape 
drink in the machine marked ORANGE 30 and orange drink 
in the GRAPE. 31 Just the one word large and 
clear, unmistakable, on each 32 machine. 33 I ask him 
: How can we go on reading 34 and make 
sense out of what we read? --- 35 How can 
they write and believe what they're writing, 36 the young 
ones across the street, 37 while you go on pouring 
grape into ORANGE 38 and orange into the one marked 
GRAPE ---? 39 (How are we going to believe what 
we read and we write and 40 we hear and 
we say and we do?) 41 He looks at the 
two machines and he smiles 42 and he shrugs and 
smiles and pours again. 43 It could be violence and 
nonviolence 44 it could be white and black women and 
men 45 it could be war and peace or any 
46 binary system, love and hate, enemy, friend. 47 Yes 
and no, be and not-be, what we do and what 
we don't do. 48 On a corner in East Harlem 
49 garbage, reading, a deep smile, rape, 50 forgetfulness, a 
hot street of murder, 51 misery, withered hope, 52 a 
man keeps pouring grape into ORANGE 53 and orange into 
the one marked GRAPE, 54 pouring orange into GRAPE and 
grape into ORANGE forever.
