1 Spotlight her face her face has no light in 
it 2 touch the cheek with light inform the eyes 
3 press meanings on those lips. 4 See cities from 
the air, 5 fix a cloud in the sky, one 
bird in the bright air, 6 one perfect mechanical flower 
in her hair. 7 Make your young men ride over 
the mesquite plains; 8 produce our country on film : 
here are the flaming shrubs, 9 the Negroes put up 
their hands in Hallelujahs, 10 the young men balance at 
the penthouse door. 11 We focus on the screen : 
look they tell us 12 you are a nation of 
similar whores remember the Maine 13 remember you have a 
democracy of champagne --- 14 And slowly the female face 
kisses the young man, 15 over his face the twelve-foot 
female head 16 the yard-long mouth enlarges and yawns 17 
The End 18 Here is a city here the village 
grows 19 here are the rich men standing rows on 
rows, 20 but the crowd seeps behind the cowboy the 
lover the king, 21 past the constructed sets America rises 
22 the bevelled classic doorways the alleys of trees are 
witness 23 America rises in a wave a mass 24 
pushing away the rot. 25 The Director cries Cut! 26 
hoarsely CUT and the people send pistons of force 27 
crashing against the CUT! CUT! of the straw men. 28 
Light is superfluous upon these eyes, 29 across our minds 
push new portents of strength 30 destroying the sets, the 
flat faces, the mock skies.
