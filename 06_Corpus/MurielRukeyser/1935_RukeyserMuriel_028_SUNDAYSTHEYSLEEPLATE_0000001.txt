1 The days are incestuous, each with its yesterday, 2 
and they, walking heavily in the streets, atone for the 
3 moment's 4 sin : their memories laboring under the 
weight of today 5 in its perverse alliance with the 
past. Laments 6 are heard, droning from the city on 
all other mornings 7 but Sundays, they sleep late, and 
need not cry to wake, 8 sniffling in the pillow, 
realizing the day's churnings 9 of minute resolving to minute, 
and the whole day slack, 10 the wind bled of 
vigor, the talk in the parlor 11 of people pasturing 
on each other's minds, and sunset 12 evolving in the 
air, a quiet change against the duller 13 signs in 
pandemonium of day's gradual transit : 14 The klaxon voices 
through the roads, the picnickers joking 15 (returning from the 
fields), who wept before they dressed. 16 On Sundays their 
dreams are longer, and their waking 17 is a long 
exhalation of their weeks, decompressed. 18 There are these things 
to be remembered : the nine boys 19 waiting, 20 
battle-fronts of the rising army with holes bitten by death, 
21 the man in the prison overland, and history beating 
22 out the recurrent facts of power, suppression, wrath. 23 
The days are incestuous. They witness the daily binding 24 
of minutes linking backwards. Their remembering atones 25 in no 
part for the things they remember. They sink in 26 
blinding 27 sleep too long, they dissolve in sleep their 
remembering bones.
