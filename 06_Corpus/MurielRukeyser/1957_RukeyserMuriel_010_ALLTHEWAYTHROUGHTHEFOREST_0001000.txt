eyes. 113 ---I'll take you across, she says. Just let 
me look, 114 I'll make sure the baby's asleep. 115 
She takes the bucket in. When she comes out, 116 
She narrows her eyes against daylight. 117 The sky gray, 
developing purple. That's storm, she says. 118 Yes, he's asleep. 
I can go down there now. 119 You a government 
man? 120 ---Not on your life. I'm with the company. 
121 You know the wires strung along the valley? 122 
That company. Do you have light in the house? 123 
---They haven't brought light in, she said. We're going to, 
124 though. We're going where it is. The dam's moving 
us 125 out. 126 He tries to say he is 
sorry. They are walking past the yard, 127 through the 
stand of hickories, then along the road. 128 There's no 
loss, she says. It's hard for the old ones. They, 
129 think of the doors and the steps, they think 
of the graves 130 As if they were children. I'm 
ready to go today. 131 My child's a baby; he's 
one; I'm alone with him. 132 His dad went to 
West Virginia to build a tunnel 133 When everything here 
had been bad for a long time. 134 Built the 
tunnel. It gave him crystal in his breathing, 135 His 
chest turned to crystal, they say, before he died. 136 
I'd like to move to the outskirts of town. 137 
They'll move me, they say, and the boy, near a 
school. 138 They tell me I can learn. A trade, 
something like that. 139 I'm sorry about your husband, he 
says. And you don't hate to 140 leave? 141 I 
should think having them tell you what to do--- 142 
How can I say it to you? She turns on 
him. Her eyes going 143 dark. 144 The boy was 
born just after they broke the news. 145 I didn't 
know how I'd get through. The birth 146 Was so 
much leaving and putting away myself and starting 147 again. 
148 Another birthing seems easy and right. 149 When the 
man talks about The Valley, he tells me 150 What 
I have thought and kept secret, telling it open and 
plain. 151 They have come to the rushing of the 
creek, foaming tawny 152 and white. 153 Endless and potent 
along the road, violent and turning 154 The rocks downhill, 
dragging the whips along. 155 ---It looks higher than the 
road over there, said the woman. 156 ---You had a 
bad time of it last year, he said. 157 ---Twisted 
the door off, spilled mud ankle deep in. 158 But 
down in the cove they had real trouble, where the 
houses 159 float by. 160 And their cattle drown. The 
chickens are swept away 161 Afterward. There was fever, too. 
The creek's just as high now 162 And they do 
say the rains are still to come.--- 163 The sky 
dark, the clouds very fast. 164 ---Next year! she says. 
The wind blows it away. 165 Next year it'll be 
built. There! she says, pointing down. 166 Down past the 
treefall slopes, the bend of the river. 167 Past the 
darkened branches, below the darkened sky, 168 The treefall slope, 
thick forest down to a wild river 169 Choked purple, 
raging upon the curve, pale in the rapids, 170 Insane 
noises driven by storm. 171 Over them 172 A stroke 
of lightning is laid across the river 173 Stopping the 
rush, the rapids, the windflowing leaves. 174 Law blazing across 
the river. 175 The moment is stopped. Then blindness, lifting 
of blindness. 176 They see the smoke-forest. Command of thunder. 
177 Streaking of light, Moses across the river. 178 Inexorable 
light. A wall of law. 179 ---Where the lightning struck. 
They mean to build there, 180 The woman is saying. 
They talk about a highway 181 That will reach the 
dam, somewhere along here---look, 182 On this tree. Over her 
head, a slash of blue color 183 Painted on bark. 
That's the surveyor's mark. 184 They think to build where 
we are now.--- 185 The forest leaves whistle in a 
forerunner breeze. 186 Now the rain, says Willkie. 187 I 
must get back to the highway.
