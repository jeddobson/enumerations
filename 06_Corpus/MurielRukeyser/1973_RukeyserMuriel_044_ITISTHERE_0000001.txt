1 Yes, it is there, the city full of music, 
2 Flute music, sounds of children, voices of poets, 3 
The unknown bird in his long call. The bells of 
peace. 4 Essential peace, it sounds across the water 5 
In the long parks where the lovers are walking, 6 
Along the lake with its island and pagoda, 7 And 
a boy learning to fish. His father threads the line. 
8 Essential peace, it sounds and it stills. Cockcrow. 9 
It is there, the human place. 10 On what does 
it depend, this music, the children's games? 11 A long 
tradition of rest? Meditation? What peace is so profound 12 
That it can reach all habitants, all children, 13 The 
eyes at worship, the shattered in hospitals? 14 All voyagers? 
15 Meditation, yes; but within a tension 16 Of long 
resistance to all invasion, all seduction of hate. 17 Generations 
of holding to resistance; and within this resistance 18 Fluid 
change that can respond, that can show the children 19 
A long future of finding, of responsibility; change within 20 
Change and tension of sharing consciousness 21 Village to city, 
city to village, person to person entire 22 With unchanging 
cockcrow and unchanging endurance 23 Under the 24 skies of 
war.
