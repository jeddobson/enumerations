1 Warm in the pool the wasted man 2 Among 
his mutilations swam. 3 Lay in the sun of his 
despair 4 While time ran around the year. 5 Legs 
of his wounded days 6 Refused, refused. He turned to 
pain, 7 The arrogant and dwindled man 8 Saying, Do 
not surrender me. 9 Though frightful time outrun my praise. 
10 PAIN: I remember the player's thighs, 11 The skill 
and locking of the knees, 12 The ruthless muscles of 
the wise. 13 Time running frightful in sunrise 14 Outrunning 
you, outrunning light, 15 Races through the dream of night. 
16 Torment lays forfeit all your dream. 17 THE SELF: 
The core of my arrogance 18 Has been transmuted, but 
your fires 19 I cannot yet meet with praise. 20 
When the boy's muscles are my dream 21 And the 
man's withered legs my day 22 All I am and 
all I seem 23 Will find the way, will find 
the way. 24 PAIN: I am the thread, I am 
the bait, 25 I am the pride of your despair. 
26 THE SELF: There are legs I shall outrun. 27 
Speed of this resurrection 28 Will find me in the 
spectral dance 29 Before the real, before the real. 30 
Somewhere my next life waits and sees 31 Time and 
the heart of man at race. 32 The wish can 
heal, the wish can heal. 33 There is such freedom 
in this place. 34 Warmth of the many-minded free, 35 
Outblazing personal liberty. 36 The cause racing, and the root 
37 To be found. A young man wrote 38 All 
of this long ago. 39 We believe ourselves by slow 
40 Turnings of the living heart. 41 Pain of that 
growth will give us start. 42 To stand so braced 
will be my pride. 43 I have been born and 
I have died; 44 Pain sends me on my wandering, 
45 Warns me of enemies about: 46 We Refuse is 
their war shout. 47 Pain sets my hand a growing 
root upon, 48 The weapon of the wounded king. 49 
In the warm pool the wasted man 50 Swam laughing 
in the sun.
