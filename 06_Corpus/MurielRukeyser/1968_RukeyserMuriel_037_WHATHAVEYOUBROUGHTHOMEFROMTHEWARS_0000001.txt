1 What have you brought 2 home from the wars, 
father? 3 Scars. 4 We fought far overseas; we knew 
5 the victory must 6 be at home. 7 But 
here I see 8 only a trial by time 9 
of those 10 who know. 11 The public men all 
shout : Come bomb, 12 come burn 13 our hate. 
14 I do not 15 want it shot; 16 I 
want it solved. 17 This is the word 18 the 
dead men said. 19 They said peace. 20 I saw 
in the hot light 21 of our century 22 each 
face killed.
