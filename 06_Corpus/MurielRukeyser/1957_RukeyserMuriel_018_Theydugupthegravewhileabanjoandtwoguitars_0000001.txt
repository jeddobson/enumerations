1 They dug up the grave, while a banjo and 
two guitars 2 Were quiet. Hush your music, Sourwood Mountain, 
3 We'll dance the Bird Cage again tonight. 4 Move 
the peacock quilt, pack up your favorite kettle, 5 There's 
extra homespun and the kerosene stove. 6 You will never 
forget the time the floor moved. 7 Frail pillars of 
reason held you with a creek gone crazy, 8 At 
five-thirty we heard the millrace and running stone. 9 The 
stars are nearly out and the legless shadows 10 Are 
men who have come to help hurt that my river 
done.
