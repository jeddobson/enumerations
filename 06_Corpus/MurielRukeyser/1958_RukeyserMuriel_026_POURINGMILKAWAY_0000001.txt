1 Here, again. A smell of dying in the milk-pale 
carton, 2 And nothing then but pour the milk away. 
3 More of the small and killed, the child's, wasted, 
4 Little white arch of the drink and taste of 
day. 5 Spoiled, gone and forgotten; thrown away. 6 Day 
after day I do what I condemned in countries. 7 
Look, the horror, the waste of food and bone. 8 
You will know why when you have lived alone.
