1 Have you heard about Mr. Bratuscha? 2 He led 
an orderly life 3 With a splendid twelve-year-old daughter, 4 
A young and passionate wife --- 5 Bratuscha, the one 
they call Cannibal. 6 Spring evening on Wednesday, 7 The 
sky is years ago; 8 The girl has been missing 
since Monday, 9 Why don't the birches blow? 10 And 
where's their daughter? 11 Nine miles to the next village 
12 Deep in the forested past --- 13 Wheatland, marshland, 
daisies 14 And a gold slender ghost. 15 It's very 
difficult to keep them safe. 16 She hasn't been seen 
and it's Thursday. 17 Down by the river, raped? 18 
Under the birches, murdered? 19 Don't let the fiend escape, 
20 First, we'll track him down and catch him. 21 
The river glittering in sunlight, 22 The woods almost black 
--- and she 23 Was always a darling, the blonde 
young daughter, 24 Gone gone vanished away. 25 They say 
Bratuscha is ready to talk. 26 O God he has 
told the whole story; 27 Everything; he has said 28 
That he killed his golden daughter 29 He ate her, 
he said it! 30 Eaten by the cannibal, Cannibal Bratuscha. 
31 Down at the church her mother 32 In the 
confession booth --- 33 She has supported his story, 34 
She has told the priest the truth; 35 Horror, and 
now the villagers gather. 36 They are ready to lynch 
Bratuscha, 37 Pounding at his door --- 38 Over the 
outcries of the good people 39 Hear the cannibal roar 
--- 40 He will hold out, bar the doorway, fight 
to the death. 41 But who is this coming, whose 
shadow 42 Runs down the river road? 43 She is 
coming, she is running, she is 44 Alive and abroad 
--- 45 She is here, she is well, she was 
in the next village. 46 The roaring dreams of her 
father : 47 He believed all he confessed --- 48 
And the mother was threatened with hellfire 49 By the 
village priest 50 If she didn't tell everything, back up 
what Bratuscha said. 51 This all took place some time 
ago 52 Before all villages joined --- 53 When there 
were separate, uncivilized people, 54 Only the birds, only the 
river, only dreams and the wind. 55 She had just 
gone off for a few days, with a friend. 56 
But O God the little Bratuscha girl 57 What will 
become of her? 58 Her mother is guilt suggestion panic 
59 Her father of dreams, a murderer 60 And in 
waking and in fantasy and now and forever. 61 Who 
will help her and you and me and all those 
62 Children of the assumption of guilt 63 And the 
roaring fantasy of nightmare 64 The bomb the loathing all 
dreams spilt 65 Upon this moment and the future and 
all unborn children. 66 We must go deep go deep 
in our lives and our dreams --- 67 Remember Cannibal 
Bratuscha his wife and his young child 68 And preserve 
our own ideas of guilt 69 Of innocence and of 
the blessed wild 70 To live out our own lives 
to make our own freedom to make 71 the world.
