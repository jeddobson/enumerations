1 After the lights and after the rumba and after 
the bourbon 2 and after the beer 3 and after 
the drums and after the samba and after the 4 
ice cream and not long after 5 failure, loss, despair, 
and loss and despair 6 There was the laughter and 
there was Cantinflas at last 7 and his polka 8 
doing the bumps with a hot guitar 9 turning unique. 
Slow. Slow. Deprecating 10 shoulder up. 11 Hand up. 12 
All the fingers tall. 13 Panache and rags and triumph 
and smile--- 14 beggar of light in ridiculous sunlight. 15 
All things human clumsy and fair 16 as graceful as 
loving as stupid as true. 17 And on this floor 
18 the dancers, in this square the little trees, 19 
and on this stage always the clown of our living 
20 gives us our sunlight and our incantation 21 as 
sun does, laughing, shining, reciting dawn, noon, and down, 22 
making all delight and healing all ills 23 like faraway 
words on jars, the labels in Protopapas' window: 24 marshmallow, 
myrtle, peppermint, pumpkin, sesame, sesame, 25 squills.
