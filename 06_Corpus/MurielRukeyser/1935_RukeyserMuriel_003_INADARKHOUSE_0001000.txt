and called their blazonry 111 1 Beauty Old Yet Ever 
New : Eternal Voice 112 And Inward Word : (a 
blur of fond noises signifying 113 a long thing) and 
raised signs, saying : 114 2 But Of All Things 
Truth Beareth Away 115 The Victory : (the pock-bitten pass 
to spit 116 gelatinously and obscenely on the bird-marked stones,

builded on stairs. One stair creaks forever amen in the 
Name. 124 Treads rock under the feet. The two go

: 134 love-writhen women's lips : the crackled lips of 
the mass 135 that must be there waiting for law 
at the wall's decay. 136 Large female : male :

over no other, come 138 Order here. 139 Steps mount. 
The brown treads rise. Stairs. Rise 140 up. Stairs.
