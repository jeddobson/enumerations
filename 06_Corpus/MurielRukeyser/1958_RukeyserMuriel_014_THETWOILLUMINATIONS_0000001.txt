1 Storm and disorder and the giant emotions, 2 The 
seven deadly sins, they scatter all my hope. 3 To 
gather them in change I summon up the image 4 
Of all arrangement in equilibrium. 5 Moments of poise in 
the middle of madness; 6 Sharpened as a forest is 
sharpened by fire, 7 I mean destroyed. 8 O abstract 
jealousy, half angel and half bird, 9 The bird smashing 
itself on the lighthouse's flying eye. 10 Tonight able at 
last to imagine perfect love--- 11 Out of all murders 
12 midnight in desire. 13 Now in a twilight moment 
I summon up twilight, 14 The two illuminations that can 
tell 15 Nothing in any second by themselves--- 16 Only 
the body's knowledge, many fresh mornings, 17 Newborn experience says 
this flicker of air 18 Over the face, this time's 
quick light is dawn. 19 I think too of a 
longhanded mime of form, 20 A dancer carrying two great 
eggs, intricacies 21 Of music and equilibrium: the boy 22 
A Javanese temple-dancer, thin-fingered, dancing 23 Turret-crowned, in his dark 
hands balancing 24 The eggs. 25 Come back to me 
soon. You are my breath and wine. 26 Did we 
then wrestle as if we were our angels? 27 There 
is peace also, 28 love changing like religion. 29 Around 
your image now my prodigal wishes 30 Gather in, like 
the eye's color in brightened rooms, 31 Contract like a 
cloud of birds about a tree.
