disintegration 135 male and female 136 If we had lived 
in our city 137 sixty years might not prove 138 
the power this week 139 the overthrown past 140 tourist 
and refugee 141 Emeric in the bow speaking his life 
142 and the night on this ship 143 the night 
over Spain 144 quick recognition 145 male and female 146 
And the war in peace, the war in war, the 
peace, 147 the faces on the dock 148 the faces 
in those hills.149 Near the end now, morning. Sleepers cover 
the decks, 150 cabins full, corridors full of sleep. But 
the light 151 vitreous, crosses water; analyzed darkness, 152 crosshatched 
in silver, passes up the shore, 153 touching limestone massif, 
deserted tableland, 154 bends with the down-warp of the coastal 
plain. 155 The colored sun stands on the route to 
Spain, 156 builds on the waves a series of mirrors 
157 and on the scorched land rises hot. 158 Coasts 
change their names as the boat goes to 159 France, 
Costa Brava softens to Côte Vermeil, 160 Spain's a horizon 
ghost behind the shapeless sea. 161 Blue praising black, a 
wind above the waves 162 moves pursuing a jewel, this 
hieroglyph 163 boat passing under the sun to lose it 
on the 164 attractive sea, habitable and kind. 165 A 
barber sun, razing three races, met 166 from the north 
with a neurotic eagerness. 167 They rush to solar attraction; 
local daybreak finds 168 them on the red earth of 
the colored cliffs; the little islands 169 tempt worshippers, gulf-purple, 
pointed bay. 170 We crowd the deck, 171 welcome the 
islands with a sense of loss.172 The wheel in the 
water, green, behind my head. 173 Turns with its light-spokes. 
Deep. And the drowning eyes 174 find under the water 
figures near 175 in their true picture, moving true, 176 
the picture of that war enlarging clarified 177 as the 
boat perseveres away, always enlarging, 178 becoming clear. 179 Boat 
of escape, your water-photograph. 180 I see this man, dock, 
war, a latent image. 181 And at my back speaking 
the black boxer, 182 telling his education : porter, fighter, 
no school, 183 no travel but this, trade-union sent a 
team. 184 I saw Europe break apart 185 and artifice 
or martyr's will 186 cannot anneal this war, nor make 
187 the loud triumphant future start 188 shouting from its 
tragic heart. 189 Deep in the water Spanish shadows turn, 
190 assume their brightness past a cruel lens, 191 quick 
vision of loss. The pastoral lighting takes 192 the boat, 
deck, passengers, the pumice cliffs, 193 the winedark sweatshirt at 
my shoulder. 194 Cover away the fighting cities 195 but 
still your death-afflicted eyes 196 must hold the print of 
flowering guns, 197 bombs whose insanity craves size, 198 the 
lethal breath, the iron prize. 199 The clouds upon the 
water-barrier pass, 200 the boat may turn to land; the 
shapes endure, 201 rise up into our eyes, to bind 
202 us back; an accident of time 203 set it 
upon us, exile burns it in. 204 Once the fanatic 
image shown, 205 enemy to enemy, 206 past and historic 
peace wear thin; 207 we see Europe break like stone, 
208 hypocrite sovereignties go down 209 before this war the 
age must win.210 The sea produced that town : Sète, 
which the boat turns to, 211 at peace. Its breakwater, 
casino, vermouth factory, beach. 212 They searched us for weapons. 
No currency went out. 213 The sign of war had 
been search for cameras, 214 pesetas and photographs go back 
to Spain, 215 the money for the army. Otto is 
fighting now, the lawyer said. 216 No highlight hero. Love's 
not a trick of light. 217 But. The town lay 
outside, peace, France. 218 And in the harbor the Russian 
boat Schachter; 219 sharp paint-smell, the bruise-colored shadow swung, 220 
sailors with fists up, greeting us, asking news, 221 making 
the harbor real. 222 Barcelona. 223 Slow-motion splash. Anchor. Small 
from the beach 224 the boy paddles to meet us, 
legs hidden in canoe, 225 curve of his blade that 
drips. 226 Now gangplank falls to deck. 227 Barcelona 228 
everywhere, Spain everywhere, the cry of Planes for Spain. 229 
The picture at our eyes, past memory, poem, 230 to 
carry and spread and daily justify. 231 The single issue, 
the live man standing tall, 232 on the hill, the 
dock, the city, all the war. 233 Exile and refugee, 
we land, we take 234 nothing negotiable out of the 
new world; 235 we believe, we remember, we saw. 236 
Mediterranean gave 237 image and peace, tideless for memory. 238 
For that beginning 239 make of us each 240 a 
continent and inner sea 241 Atlantis buried outside 242 to 
be won.
