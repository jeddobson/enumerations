for Eleanor Clark 1 What hill can ever hold us? 
2 Standing high 3 we saw December packed, snow upon 
snow, 4 empty until the cars, leaping in beams below, 
5 opened the shadow of the trees in fans 6 
enormous on the plain, fragile and magnified. 7 Print of 
the delicate branch sweeping our feet 8 in hundred hugeness, 
passing to white again. 9 Up the dark hill a 
pack of cats : 10 bursting from hollows, streaming to 
the crest, 11 streaming all night toward dawn 12 when 
green invaded east. 13 We stood to hear the rigid 
cock cry Five 14 a black cock crowing over cold 
water, 15 when all those cats found their sole proud 
objective 16 and whirled away to slaughter. 17 We walk 
the streets 18 of the dark city, 19 placards at 
back 20 light in our heads, 21 Moon rides over 
us 22 town streams below : 23 Strike and support 
us 24 the strike-songs go. 25 Ceilings of stars 26 
disturb our faces, 27 tantrums of light 28 summon our 
eyes; 29 The daystar stands 30 hungry for day : 
31 we file, regarding 32 this twin morning. 33 Shall 
that bind us, 34 parade and planet, 35 mobile and 
point? 36 No, not yet, 37 there is a labor 
38 before reunion. 39 Poets, pickets, 40 prepare for dawn! 
41 Come chop the days 42 lop off the moving 
hours, 43 we had not known there were disparate things. 
44 Forget these syntheses and fade 45 peerless and distant 
into a distant grave 46 still hoping unity indeed be 
made? 47 I wish you to be saved . . 
. you wish . . . he wishes . . 
. she . . . 48 in conjugation of a 
destiny. 49 We were figures rubbed by wind passing upon 
a frieze, 50 galloping figures at a column's base 51 
hungrily running from death and marble space. 52 I give 
you cats : I give you a cock on a 
hill : 53 these stream in beauty : that stands 
blocked in pride 54 I pledge you death until 55 
they fight and acquiesce, or one has died. 56 Earnestly 
and slowly I continue : 57 no one could guess 
how the impact of a word 58 heard plain and 
plainly understood 59 can have attacked us so and so 
deferred. 60 Fight them down, deliver yourself, friend! 61 see, 
we all fight it down : poetry, picket-line, 62 to 
master pride and muscle fluid with sun, 63 conflicting graces 
moving to one end. 64 Witness the unfailing war, season 
with season, 65 license and principle, sex with tortured sex, 
66 class versus class, and help us to survey 67 
this city for faces, this hill for tracks. 68 Sickness 
will bind itself upon our tissue 69 clipping off with 
restriction blood and heat and milk, 70 becoming real against 
all disbelief 71 a sly ghost coughing to advertise its 
bulk. 72 Climax to Egypt, our milestone pyramid 73 forces 
out history and we remember 74 conflict of thousands of 
April processions, 75 rival winds ripping at the heart's deep 
chamber. 76 No natural poison : a vicious, banker's thrust 
77 nudges toward dissolution during war, 78 this peak of 
open battle points disgust 79 of decay, counterattacks backing us 
to our door. 80 This is when death thrives in 
the rot 81 and formal nightmare, zebra of sleep, 82 
presents us madness, diffusion to remember, 83 to cherish, loss 
if we lose; and dust to keep. 84 Resent the 
nightmare, assume a waking stance, 85 this clock revolt, held 
in the hand and striking, 86 clapping, the violent wings 
of a struck bird, 87 speaks your top hour, marks 
your fatal chance. 88 "Still elegiac! : between two battles, 
when one is happy 89 to be alive!" --- Rosa 
Luxemburg 90 Here was a battle forced by the brain's 
fortitude, 91 mapping machines of peace before crisis had come; 
92 and by this planning we create a world 93 
new-hearted, secure from common delirium. 94 If the strike was 
won, the prisoners freed at last, 95 the cataract tapped 
for power, parade-songs sung : 96 Prepare for continuance, open 
your brilliant love, 97 your life, --- front April, give 
it tongue ! 98 Below the flowering hedge 99 rest 
in the light, forget 100 grief's awful violet 101 and 
indecision's wedge 102 driven into your pride, 103 and how 
the past has died. 104 Here is transition : 105 
pain, but no surgeon's knife 106 : anaesthetize your life? 
107 you lose the vision 108 of how you simply 
walk 109 toward a younger folk, 110 simply, a flaming 
wire 111 advancing on the night, 112 reducing midnight 113 
to clear noon-fire; 114 moving upon the future 115 and 
large, clean stature 116 nearer to all your nature. 117 
The latchpieces of consciousness unfasten. 118 We are stroked out 
of dream and night and myth, 119 and turning slowly 
to awareness, listen 120 to the soft bronchial whisperings of 
death. 121 Never forget in legendary darkness 122 the ways 
of the hands' turning and the mouth's ways, 123 wander 
in the fields of change and not remember 124 a 
voice and many voices and the evening's burning. 125 Turn 
and remember, this is the world made plain 126 by 
chart and signal, instrument and name : 127 to some 
we say Master, others call Sister, 128 to some we 
offer nothing but love : 129 flier in advance, the 
cloud over his mouth ; 130 the inventor who produces 
the moment of proof ; 131 a sun and moon 
and other several stars ; 132 and those who know 
each other over wars. 133 Cats stream upon a hill, 
134 the poet-cock breaks his throat now to say : 
135 Moment of Proof, May dawn transposing night, 136 partisan 
dawn's on the side of day! 137 What hill can
