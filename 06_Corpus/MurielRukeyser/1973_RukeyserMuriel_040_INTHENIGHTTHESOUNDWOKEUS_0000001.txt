1 In the night the sound woke us. 2 We 
went up to the deck. 3 Brightness of brightness in 
the black night. 4 The ship standing still, her hold 
wide open. 5 Light shining orange on the lumber 6 
her cargo, fresh strong-smelling wood. 7 A tall elder sailor 
standing at the winches, 8 his arms still, down; not 
seeming to move, 9 his hands hidden behind 10 black 
leather balcony. 11 The silver-hair tall sailor, stern and serene 
his face 12 turning from side to side. 13 The 
winches fell and rose with the newborn wood. 14 Orange 
and blazing in the lights it rose. 15 Vancouver straits, 
a northern midnight. 16 Delivered from death I stood awake 
17 seeing it brought to the cool shining air. 18 
O death, skillful, at night, in the bright light 19 
bringing to birth. 20 Over my head 21 I see 
it in the air.
