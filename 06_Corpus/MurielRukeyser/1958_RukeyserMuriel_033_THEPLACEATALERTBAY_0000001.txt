1 Standing high on the shoulders of all things, all 
things. 2 Creation pole reaching over my teeming island 3 
That plays me at last a fountain of images. 4 
Away from the road, life rising from all of us, 
5 The grove of animals and our souls built in 
towers. 6 A music to be resumed in God. 7 
Our branched belief, the power-winged tree. 8 Tree of meanings 
where the first mothers pour 9 Their totems, their images, 
up among the sun. 10 We build our gifts: language 
of process offers 11 Life above life moving, a ladder 
of lives 12 Reaching to time that is resumed in 
God. 13 Did the thunderbird gave you yourself? The man 
mourning? 14 The cedar forest between the cryings of ravens? 
15 Everfound mother, streaming of dolphins, whale-white moon. 16 Father 
of salmon-clouded seas, your face. 17 Water. Weatherbeaten image of 
us all. 18 All forms to be resumed in God. 
19 For here, all energy is form: the dead, the 
unborn, 20 All supported on the shoulders of us all, 
21 And all forever reaching from the source of all 
things. 22 Pillars of process, the growing of the soul, 
23 Form that is energy from these seas risen, 24 
Identified. Resumed in God.
