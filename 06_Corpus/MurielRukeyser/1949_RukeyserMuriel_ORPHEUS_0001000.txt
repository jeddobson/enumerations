undiscovered music, 107 what laying on of grace? 108 Healing 
of the valleys of sacrifice 109 and five rivers finally 
trembling down 110 to open sea. 111 I almost remember 
another body, 112 I almost, another face. 113 The wounds 
: Love me! 114 Something turned back, something looked Hellward 
round. 115 Not this hard heelbone, something that lived and 
ran. 116 The muscles of the thigh are the rapids 
of a stream, 117 the knee a monument stone among 
fast waters, 118 light flowing under the skin, the current 
hardnesses, 119 channels where, secret, the awareness streamed. 120 No! 
121 That was not how it was! 122 They will 
say I turned to a face. 123 That was forbidden. 
There was a moment of turning, 124 but not to 
a face. This leg did turn, 125 there was a 
turn, and then there was a journey, 126 and after 
many dances and wanderings 127 Yes; but there was a 
face. 128 Who will speak to the wounds? Who will 
have grace, 129 who will touch this broken, who will 
dare being whole 130 to offer healing? Who broken enough 
to know 131 that the gift is the only real, 
who will heal these wounds? 132 Rolled like a stone 
in a riverbed 133 The stone exposed in the dry 
riverbed 134 This head of dreams, horizon of this murder, 
135 rolled on the mountaintop. The man who is all 
head, 136 this is, in the circus. Arches of music, 
arches of the brain, 137 furrows and harvests plowed by 
song. Whom song 138 could never capture. This it was 
alive 139 led Jason past the sirens, this 140 in 
Egypt and in Hell had heard of Heaven 141 and 
reading Moses found the breath of life, 142 looked up 
and listening felt the breath of death 143 at the 
left ear, finding then every life 144 among the men 
of mud and the men of sunlight 145 the women 
turned to light in the eyes of this head. 146 
The head; the song; and the way to transcend. 147 
The song and chance. The way beyond the wound. 148 
Rolled, like the music of an old ballad, 149 a 
song of heroes, a stone, a hope, a star over 
head. 150 The head turns into a cloud and the 
cloud rises 151 unwounded, the cloud assumes the shapes of 
plants, 152 a giant plant. Rolls to the great anvil 
storm-cloud, 153 creates the storm. This is the head of 
dream. 154 Only there is a wound that cries all 
night. 155 We have not yet come through. It cries 
Speak, it cries Turn. 156 Majesty, lifted omen. The power 
to make. 157 The burning ship that sails to the 
burning sun 158 a sun half sky half water wholly 
flame, 159 the burning ship half wood half water all 
fire. 160 There is no riddle but all is mystery. 
161 There is only life. To live is to create. 
162 Father of song, in the seed and vaults of 
the sea, 163 the wall of light and pillars of 
desire, 164 the dark. The dark. But I will know 
again, 165 I will know more and again, 166 woman 
and man. 167 And turn and arise and give these 
wounds their song. 168 They have no song and no 
music. They are wounds. 169 And the air-tree, the air-heart 
170 cannot propose old death-breath any song. 171 Fountain of 
air, I see you offering, 172 this air is a 
bird among the scenes of the body, 173 a golden 
plover, a blackheart plover. 174 Here is his body and 
the trees of life, 175 the red tree, the ivory, 
the tree of nerves, 176 powerless to bear another song. 
177 Chopped like the chopped gold of fields harvested, 178 
air falling through many seductive shapes, 179 cascades of air. 
180 The shadow falling from the tree to the ground. 
181 Let the wounds change. Let them not cry aloud. 
182 Blood-clothed structure, bone of body's being, 183 there is 
no sin here, all the giant emotions 184 were uncorrupted, 
but there is no sign. 185 The bones and the 
skein of flowing, the many-chaining 186 blood and the chain 
of dreams and chain of silver nerves 187 cannot remember. 
They cannot imagine. No space 188 is here, no chance 
nor geometry, 189 any more than this mountain has its 
space or chance. 190 The mountain looks down the road. 
It sees the last of the 191 women 192 escaped 
and alone, running away the road. 193 It sees one 
woman in a million shapes, 194 procession of women down 
the road of time. 195 They have changed into weapons; 
now they need be whole. 196 And the pieces of 
the body cannot be. 197 They do not even know 
they need be whole. 198 Only the wounds in their 
endless crying. 199 Now they know. 200 Touch me! Love 
me! Speak to me! 201 One effort and one risk. 
202 The hand is risen. It braces itself, it flattens, 
203 and the third finger touches the lyre. Wounds of 
hand. 204 But it finds thick gold of frame, grasps 
the frame 205 with its old fingering of bone and 
gold. 206 Now there is blood, a train of blood 
on grass 207 as hand swings high and with a 
sowing gesture 208 throws the lyre upward. The lyre is 
going up: 209 the old lyre of Orpheus, four strings 
of song 210 of the dawn of all things, daystar, 
daymoon, and man, 211 hurtles up, whistling through black air. 
212 Tingles in moon-air. Reaches the other stars. 213 And 
these four strings now sing: 214 Eurydice.215 Standing in silence 
on the mountaintop, the trees incline before 216 the breath 
of fire. 217 Very slowly, the sounds awake. Breathing that 
is the 218 consciousness, the lifting 219 and the resting 
of life, and surf-sounds of many flames. 220 Flame in
