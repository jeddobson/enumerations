1 And if the curtain lifts, it is a window-shade, 
2 and if there is a stage, it is the 
room at home. 3 Furnished as we remember it. Not 
too well lit. 4 The wooden chair the bed quite 
neatly made. 5 The face is discovered in shadow, but 
someone is there. 6 If we look without fear, we 
will all know who it is. 7 This is a 
theatre and many masks have played 8 the part; female 
or male : it will not matter here. 9 The 
role is traditional. It does what others did, 10 if 
anything is said, it is what others said. 11 The 
exits are a window and a door, both shut. 12 
We in the audience know what is in that head, 
13 see only the fixtures of that room, but hear 
the loud 14 and ringing world; doorbell, radio, phones, and 
voices in the hall; 15 the words in the parents' 
bedroom; the shot in the street. 16 The play could 
be anywhere; the stage could expand. It does not. 17 
Its acts are single actions in the player's head; 18 
watch Act One. Player crosses---hero and bride and clown--- 19 
and flings the window up letting the dark shine down, 
20 the black in whom no coward is afraid. 21 
Stares from the window into the audience, 22 a mirror 
of the world that stays and stares 23 and sees 
the player staring think, dismayed, 24 of an immense vaudeville 
of a century 25 when anyone may sit in a 
row of chairs 26 dummy of a ventriloquist who made 
27 a head lying in his hand speak with a 
candid voice. 28 The play the player sees is at 
the margin of the mind. 29 The player thinks : 
Who speaks for me? What road 30 takes me away 
from here? The door's or window's? Act Two. 31 The 
player crosses the room to the desk; looks down. 32 
Letters from friends are clews, the child at the shore, 
33 the oversize girl, and the adolescent swayed 34 by 
every attraction. The letters are appeals : We Need. 35 
Come out and help us. We did not remain. 36 
The little boy runs into his green wave, 37 movies 
are teaching the slickhaired shortstop love, 38 the fat girl 
is seen entering cafeterias 39 pretending she's pregnant so people 
will be kind. 40 They show the player no exit 
of rescue. Act Three. 41 Stands at the door, flattened 
against the wood, 42 hearing the parents' quarrel, thinking of 
father 43 who was the mother's favorite child, the mother 
44 who was the father's favorite daughter, drawing 45 comfort 
from the bodies of her children, lowered 46 resistance in 
them, told them to love one person 47 which was 
impossible : they needed first two parents, 48 they were 
lost : there came upon them confusion of sex 49 
and the maternal was male, and the great breast was 
drawn 50 forever in remembrance over the stammering mouth. 51 
The player runs to the bed, slaps tired body down. 
52 Act Four. Radio playing Sweet Mystery of Life. 53 
The hands are hidden and the sobbing's hard. 54 The 
loyal, the little; and the father is absent, 55 his 
feet are on a desk, trucks roll over his heart, 
56 and the mother's hysterics menace the whole house, 57 
resolving nothing. They change; cancers invade them. 58 The player 
gets up in hatred, goes to the window, leans 59 
out over the audience, speculates, Should you jump? 60 Walk 
down that roomlong road? It will not take you home. 
61 As each step falls, a birth arrives. It is 
not you. 62 The sky of the Fifth Act is 
slant and tall, 63 sails on its kelson cloud. A 
champion angel stands, 64 possibly, on an arch in a 
spill of gold. 65 But if it does, it is 
a statue. The end's prepared. 66 This victim must come 
to death as the shade goes down. 67 The player 
turns in the middle of the room, and speaks. 68 
"Bargain," shouts to the audience, "bargain, but answer! 69 "I 
will tell you what I am if you tell me 
where you are. 70 "Not everything that happens happens in 
the street! 71 "You are souls riding me, and I'm 
to be your ghost--- 72 "I have more in me 
than that! Ticket-taker, their money back! 73 "I know a 
way to start!" Laughs, and slams out the door.
