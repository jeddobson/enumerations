1 We started to walk but it was wading-slow. 2 
Ran to the corner and boarded at the carstop, 3 
impatient through the city, hating the noise of iron. 4 
Shut it out of the head 5 until the city, 
quiet, goes submarine 6 and we are winding through, defended, 
winding, with 7 weird deepseas, the famous world, swimming, facing 
our 8 youth. 9 Their faces royal in pain, useless 
children advance 10 down avenues shining a stormy cobalt sky. 
11 The lights go green. They stare. Stop riding, cross 
the street, 12 here are rich avenues, a city's alibi, 
13 here's your prophetic love and object lesson : 14 
Shops will instruct you what to want. 15 Strangers will 
serve you, floorwalkers. 16 Condition: don't notice their disease. 17 
be easy-going, and so, susceptible. 18 These to cultivate, perhaps 
have: 19 flippant defeat, good sportsmanship, 20 the miracle figure 
of the football-player: 21 a perfect husband, a promised income. 
22 We were too earnest. We had to lose. 23 
We wound past armies of strangers, waving love's 24 thin 
awkward plant among a crowd of salesmen. 25 "Sold the 
salesmen? Been loved, loving? You, too young?" 26 We stared 
at policemen, hypnotized by force, 27 holding the ball during 
games, forgetting to throw, 28 as they padlocked the bar, 
clapped boards across the door, 29 padlocked the union hall. 
Deported. Shut. 30 Winding through avenues, stone blocked our eyes, 
31 we dreamed raw yellow hills of mustard-flower. 32 Mind's 
tropic scenery was farmed : Come back to stay, 33 
return to the broken man across the subway, 34 read 
crinkled Atlantics, tabloid skies---your feet 35 slap stone; this is 
you, advancing down a street, 36 your ancestors being dead, 
your parents busy somewhere. 37 You have a class. You 
have your object lessons. 38 Radio City, largest of riches, 
leaning 39 against the flaming cobalt, fatal as Belgium, 40 
flowers in neon on the winter air, 41 All its 
theatres open padded lobbies 42 all its windows run light 
43 And adolescent breasts, alert for terror, 44 fingers ophelian 
white and quick with fear 45 flower aware, and the 
staring workman 46 walks down expensive streets. And all the 
adolescents, 47 winding, and submarine, waking, with sleep shaken 48 
go weaving among the crowds; growing remember 49 Alexander, peacock 
of Macedon, Euclid building his circles on 50 the flat 
Greek sand, 51 the violent empresses, Boone breaking through green 
52 country--- 53 in the papers, Ann Burlak makes women 
pound kettles 54 for drums, for a loud band! 55 
Miss Swan, the Latin teacher, hand laid on moulding, 56 
speaks Cicero admirably, for massy syllables, hearing the 57 pompous 
Senate heave; we fidget until the hour--- 58 we compare 
lipsticks, smudging our palms with red. 59 Know Rome is 
elsewhere and the street's outside. 60 And fast thoughts run 
like fire as the roads divide. 61 The adolescents, walking, 
at school, going through streets, 62 stop wavering, heal their 
minds snapped during mutiny. 63 Believing at first in easy 
cures, the floundering blood to be 64 healed by love, 
65 not yet knowing that thousands walk straightforward, wish the 
same, 66 young, and winding through cities, young, seeing time's 
67 disease. 68 Parading upon a stage lit with immense 
firm flame. 69 To change it. To mature. To find. 
To be these.
