1 Woman as gates, saying: 2 "The process is after 
all like music, 3 like the development of a piece 
of music. 4 The fugues come back and 5 again 
and again 6 interweave. 7 A theme may seem to 
have been put aside, 8 but it keeps returning--- 9 
the same thing modulated, 10 somewhat changed in form. 11 
Usually richer. 12 And it is very good that this 
is so." 13 A woman pouring her opposites. 14 "After 
all there are happy things in life too. 15 Why 
do you show only the dark side?" 16 "I could 
not answer this. But I know--- 17 in the beginning 
my impulse to know 18 the working life 19 had 
little to do with 20 pity or sympathy. 21 I 
simply felt 22 that the life of the workers was 
beautiful." 23 She said, "I am groping in the dark." 
24 She said, "When the door opens, of sensuality, 25 
then you will understand it too. The struggle begins. 26 
Never again to be free of it, 27 often you 
will feel it to be your enemy. 28 Sometimes 29 
you will almost suffocate, 30 such joy it brings." 31 
Saying of her husband : "My wish 32 is to 
die after Karl. 33 I know no person who can 
love as he can, 34 with his whole soul. 35 
Often this love has oppressed me; 36 I wanted to 
be free. 37 But often too it has made me 
38 so terribly happy." 39 She said : "We rowed 
over to Carrara at dawn, 40 climbed up to the 
marble quarries 41 and rowed back at night. The drops 
of water 42 fell like glittering stars 43 from our 
oars." 44 She said : "As a matter of fact, 
45 I believe 46 that bisexuality 47 is almost a 
necessary factor 48 in artistic production; at any rate, 49 
the tinge of masculinity within me 50 helped me 51 
in my work." 52 She said : "The only technique 
I can still manage. 53 It's hardly a technique at 
all, lithography. 54 In it 55 only the essentials count."

to me: 57 "Kollwitz? She's too black-and-white."
