1 On all the streetcorners the children are standing, 2 
They ask What can it mean? 3 The grownups answer 
A flying red horse 4 Signifies gasoline. 5 The man 
at the Planetarium, 6 Pointing beyond the sky, 7 Is 
not going to say that Pegasus 8 Means poetry. 9 
Some of our people feel like death, 10 And some 
feel rather worse. 11 His energy, in this night of 
lies, 12 Flies right against the curse. 13 What's red? 
What is the flying horse? 14 They swear they do 
not know, 15 But just the same, and every night, 
16 All the streetcorners glow. 17 Even the Pentagon, even 
the senators, 18 Even the President sitting on his arse--- 
19 Never mind---over all cities 20 The flying red horse.
