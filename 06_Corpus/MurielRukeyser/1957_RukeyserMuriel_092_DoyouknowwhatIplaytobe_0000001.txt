1 Do you know what I play to be, in 
bed at night? 2 I play to be a little 
baby. Do you know why? 3 People take care of 
little babies. 4 Of course they don't have as much 
fun as grownup people cause 5 they are so little 
and can't walk or have knives or eat cake or 
6 anything, but they do get taken care of. 7 
I used to want to grow up to be big. 
8 That's what I used to play at night in 
bed. 9 But I'm going to grow up anyway. 10 
So I don't think about that any more if it's 
going to be anyway. 11 I think about if I 
was a little baby. 12 I wouldn't have to do 
things I don't like to do, 13 Shot by a 
gun I would be dead 14 But I wouldn't know 
why about it, 15 Because babies are so little little 
that they don't know about 16 things. 17 They are 
just small and eat and sleep and never have to 
worry. 18 So I play I am a baby and 
do not have to do things for myself 19 or 
worry. 20 Â¶Youth shapes its own destiny. 21 ---Motto of
