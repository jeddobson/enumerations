1 Came in my full youth to the midnight cave 
2 Nerves ringing; and this thing I did alone. 3 
Wanting my fulness and not a field of war, 4 
For the world considered annihilation, a star 5 Called Wormwood 
rose and flickered, shattering 6 Bent light over the dead 
boiling up in the ground, 7 The biting yellow of 
their corrupted lives 8 Streaming to war, denying all our 
words. 9 Nothing was left among the tainted weather 10 
But world-walking and shadowless Ajanta. 11 Hallucination and the metal 
laugh 12 In clouds, and the mountain-spectre riding storm. 13 
Nothing was certain but a moment of peace, 14 A 
hollow behind the unbreakable waterfall. 15 All the way to 
the cave, the teeming forms of death, 16 And death, 
the price of the body, cheap as air. 17 I 
blessed my heart on the expiation journey 18 For it 
had never been unable to suffer: 19 When I met 
the man whose face looked like the future, 20 When 
I met the whore with the dying red hair, 21 
The child myself who is my murderer. 22 So came 
I between heaven and my grave 23 Past the serene 
smile of the voyeur, to 24 This cave where the 
myth enters the heart again.25 Space to the mind, the 
painted cave of dream. 26 This is not a womb, 
nothing but good emerges : 27 This is a stage, 
neither unreal nor real, 28 Where the walls are the 
world, the rocks and palaces 29 Stand on a borderland 
of blossoming ground. 30 If you stretch your hand, you 
touch the slope of the world 31 Reaching in interlaced 
gods, animals, and men. 32 There is no background. The 
figures hold their peace 33 In a web of movement. 
There is no frustration, 34 Every gesture is taken, everything 
yields connections. 35 The heavy sensual shoulders, the thighs, the 
blood-born flesh 36 And earth turning into color, rocks into 
their crystals, 37 Water to sound, fire to form; life 
flickers 38 Uncounted into the supple arms of love. 39 
The space of these walls is the body's living space; 
40 Tear open your ribs and breathe the color of 
time 41 Where nothing leads away, the world comes forward 
42 In flaming sequences. Pillars and prisms. Riders 43 And 
horses and the figures of consciousness, 44 Red cow grows 
long, goes running through the world. 45 Flung into movement 
in carnal purity, 46 These bodies are sealed---warm lip and 
crystal hand 47 In a jungle of light. Color-sheeted, seductive 
48 Foreboding eyelid lowered on the long eye, 49 Fluid 
and vulnerable. The spaces of the body 50 Are suddenly 
limitless, and riding flesh 51 Shapes constellations over the golden 
breast, 52 Confusion of scents and illuminated touch--- 53 Monster 
touch, the throat printed with brightness, 54 Wide outlined gesture 
where the bodies ride. 55 Bells, and the spirit flashing. 
The religious bells, 56 Bronze under the sunlight like breasts 
ringing, 57 Bronze in the closed air, the memory of 
walls, 58 Great sensual shoulders in the web of time.59 
A procession of caresses alters the ancient sky 60 Until 
new constellations are the body shining: 61 There's the Hand 
to steer by, there the horizon Breast, 62 And the 
Great Stars kindling the fluid hill. 63 All the rooms 
open into magical boxes, 64 Nothing is tilted, everything flickers 
65 Sexual and exquisite. 66 The panther with its throat 
along my arm 67 Turns black and flows away. 68 
Deep in all streets passes a faceless whore 69 And 
the checkered men are whispering one word. 70 The face 
I know becomes the night-black rose. 71 The sharp face 
is now an electric fan 72 And says one word 
to me. 73 The dice and the alcohol and the 
destruction 74 Have drunk themselves and cast. 75 Broken bottle 
of loss, and the glass 76 Turned bloody into the 
face. 77 Now the scene comes forward, very clear. 78 
Dream-singing, airborne, surrenders the recalled, 79 The gesture arrives riding 
over the breast, 80 Singing, singing, tender atrocity, 81 The 
silver derelict wearing fur and claws. 82 O love, I 
stood under the apple branch, 83 I saw the whipped 
bay and the small dark islands, 84 And night sailing 
the river and the foghorn's word. 85 My life said 
to you: I want to love you well. 86 The 
wheel goes back and I shall live again, 87 But 
the wave turns, my birth arrives and spills 88 Over 
my breast the world bearing my grave, 89 And your 
eyes open in earth. You touched my life. 90 My 
life reaches the skin, moves under your smile, 91 And 
your throat and your shoulders and your face and your 
92 thighs 93 Flash. 94 I am haunted by interrupted 
acts, 95 Introspective as a leper, enchanted 96 By a 
repulsive clew, 97 A gross and fugitive movement of the 
limbs. 98 Is this the love that shook the lights 
to flame? 99 Sheeted avenues thrash in the wind, 100 
Torn streets, the savage parks. 101 I am plunged deep. 
Must find the midnight cave.102 A habit leading to murder, 
smoky laughter 103 Hated at first, but necessary later. 104 
Alteration of motives. To stamp in terror 105 Around the 
deserted harbor, down the hill 106 Until the woman laced 
into a harp 107 Screams and screams and the great 
clock strikes, 108 Swinging its giant figures past the face. 
109 The Floating Man rides on the ragged sunset 110 
Asking and asking. Do not say, Which loved? 111 Which 
was beloved? Only, Who most enjoyed? 112 Armored ghost of 
rage, screaming and powerless. 113 Only find me and touch 
my blood again. 114 Find me. A girl runs down 
the street 115 Singing Take me, yelling Take me Take 
116 Hang me from the clapper of a bell 117 
And you as hangman ring it sweet tonight, 118 For
