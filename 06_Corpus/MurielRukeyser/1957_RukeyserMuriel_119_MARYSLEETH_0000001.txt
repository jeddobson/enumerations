1 So going slowly now 2 A man from his 
green, 3 In a hid groaning light; 4 So ill 
concealed 5 The grinding of his pain 6 Amazes my 
square house 7 With its dark rays. 8 Lights my 
days now 9 With betraying, 10 A man against himself, 
11 His life broken open, 12 All his refusals 13 
Reflected back again 14 On his blue eyes. 15 He 
always ready 16 To break down doors 17 Stood in 
my doorway 18 Begging my hiding--- 19 Nothing will keep 
him now 20 From his soul and the world, 21 
Least not his own self, 22 Its hiding and its 
cries.
