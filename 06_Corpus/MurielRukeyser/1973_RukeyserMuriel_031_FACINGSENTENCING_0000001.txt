1 Children remembering sadness grieve, they grieve. 2 But sadness 
is not so terrible. Children 3 Grown old speak of 
fear saying, we are to 4 Fear only this fear 
itself. But fear is not to be so feared. 5 
Numbness is. To stand before my judge 6 Not knowing 
what I mean : to walk up 7 To him, 
my judge, and back to nobody 8 For the courtroom 
is almost empty, the world 9 Is almost silent, and 
suppose we did not know 10 This power to fall 
into each other's eyes 11 And say We love; and 
say We know each other 12 And say among silence 
We will help stop this war.
