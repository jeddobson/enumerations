1 The girl being chosen stood in her naked room 
2 Singing at last alone naked and proud 3 Now 
that the god had departed and his doom 4 Guarded 
her door forever and the sky 5 Would flame in 
trophies all night and every day. 6 Sang: When your 
white sun stood still, I put away 7 My garments 
and my crafts and you came down. 8 When you 
took me as a flame, I turned to flame; 9 
In whiteness I lay on the mist-flower river-bank 10 When 
you as a swan arrived, and cloudy in my tower 
11 For you as a shower of gold, the lily 
bright in my hand 12 Once, you as unthinkable light. 
13 Make me more human, 14 Give me the consciousness 
15 Of every natural shape, to lie here ready 16 
For love as every power. 17 I wait in all 
my hopes, 18 Poet beast and woman, 19 Wait for 
the superhuman, 20 The god who invaded the gold lady, 
21 The god who spoke to the naked princess, 22 
The storm over the fiery wanderer. 23 Within me your 
city burning, and your desperate tree. 24 All that the 
song and the apparition gave 25 To seal my mouth 
with fire, make me mad 26 With song and pain 
and waiting, leave me free 27 In all my own 
shapes, deep in the spirit's cave 28 To sing again 
the entrance of the god.
