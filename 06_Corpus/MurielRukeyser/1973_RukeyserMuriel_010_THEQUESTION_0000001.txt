1 Mother and listener she is, but she does not 
listen. 2 I look at her profile as I ask, 
the sweet blue-grey of eye 3 going obdurate to my 
youth as I ask the first grown sexual 4 question. 
She cannot reply. 5 And from then on even past 
her death, I cannot fully 6 have language with my 
mother, not as daughter 7 and mother through all the 
maze and silences 8 of all the turnings. 9 Until 
my own child grows and asks, and until 10 I 
discover what appalled my mother long before, discover 11 who 
never delivered her, until their double weakness and 12 strength 
in myself 13 rouse and deliver me from that refusal. 
14 I threw myself down on the pine-needle evening. 15 
Although that old ancient poem never did come to me, 
16 not from you, mother, 17 although in answer you 
did only panic, you did only grieve, 18 and I 
went silent alone, my cheek to the red pine-needle 19 
earth, and although it has taken me all these years 
20 and sunsets to come to you, past the dying, 
I know, 21 I come with my word alive.
