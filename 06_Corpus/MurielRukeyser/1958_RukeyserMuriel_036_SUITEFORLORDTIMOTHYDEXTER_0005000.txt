tremble. 419 Keep up to what we set out to 
be, honest republicans, 420 No king, but you won't go 
it long without being honest; 421 If dishonest, you must 
have a king. 422 Keep Judas out of your councils. 
423 Watch day and night, for mankind is mankind. 424 
Jockey-handed priests, deacons, grunters, whiners--- 425 (And I will show 
you one more private torture: 426 Abraham Bishop my son-in-law 
from whom 427 I live in hell on earth; pity 
me, fellow mortals, 428 A.B. mad with learning, as poor 
as a snake, 429 As proud as Lucifer. A.B. is 
a beast, 430 A Connecticut bull, short neck, thick curly 
hair. 431 When I see my father, the great good 
man, 432 Father Thomas Jefferson, he'll shed great tears with 
grief.) 433 A sortment, a sortment is good in a 
shop. 434 How many nicknames three things have: 435 Sex 
and glory and the grave. 436 Now I suppose I 
may guess 437 As it is guessing time: 438 I 
guess the world is all one 439 Very large living 
creature; 440 Mankind is the master beast, 441 As in 
the sea the whale 442 Is head fish---master over the 
443 Whole of beasts and fish, 444 But still we're 
all one creature. 445 Man is the masterly beast, 446 
And also the worst of the whole, 447 Knowing the 
most and acting the worst 448 According to what we 
know. 449 I think when the candle goes out 450 
Men and women are done at one blow, 451 We 
will lie then as dirt of rocks 452 Until the 
great gun go--- 453 ,000,000,000 tons 454 Of the best 
good powder. 455 That will shake and bring all the 
456 Bones together, 457 Then the world will be to 
an end. 458 All kinds of music then, 459 And 
funding laid aside, 460 The melody will be very great,--- 
461 Now why won't you believe me? 462 It is 
as true as apple-seed, 463 The sea and sea-music. 464 
True as the voices that through me burn--- 465 As 
true as we died and we are born, 466 Apple-seed 
and apple-thorn 467 Calling root and calling hand, 468 Saying 
Amen, mockery, Amen, fantasy, 469 Sea-music and the sea.405 A 
feat of laughter and a coastwise dance 406 Among the 
ills of ocean, in pauper light 407 Imagining truth, at 
dawn turning from madness 408 Into the unknown world, up 
blue invisible 409 Mountains of fantasy climbing 410 To the 
sea. 411 Where he as a boy walked down, salty, 
in brightness 412 Raging and worshipping. 413 Their faces turn 
again the nailhead stare 414 Of proverbs glaring at the 
intuitive. 415 My old head has 416 Worn out three 
bodies. 417 Amen. Clean truth. 418 Pay the whole debt, 
it will make nations tremble. 419 Keep up to what 
we set out to be, honest republicans, 420 No king, 
but you won't go it long without being honest; 421 
If dishonest, you must have a king. 422 Keep Judas
