young cat. 134 He does not know he is locked 
in.135 In prison, the prisoners. 136 One black girl, 19 
years. 137 She has killed her child 138 and she 
grieves, she grieves. 139 She crosses to my bed. 140 
"What do Free mean?" 141 I look at her. 142 
"You don't understand English." 143 "Yes, I understand English." 144 
"What do Free mean?"145 In prison a 146 brown paper 
bag 147 I put it beside my cot. 148 All 
my things. 149 Comb, notebook, underwear, 150 letterpaper, toothbrush, book. 
151 I am rich --- 152 they have given me 
another toothbrush. 153 The guard saying: 154 "You'll find people 
share here."155 Photos, more precise than any face can be. 
156 The broken static moment, life never by 157 any 
eye seen.158 My contradictions set me tasks, errands.159 This I 
know: 160 What I reap, that shall I sow.161 How 
we live: 162 I look into my face in the 
square glass. 163 Under it, a bright flow of cold 
water. 164 At once, a strong arrangement of presences: 165 
I am holding a small glass 166 under the little 
flow 167 at Fern Spring, among the western forest. 168 
A cool flaw among the silence. 169 The taste of 
the waterfall.170 Some rare battered she-poet, old girl in the 
Village 171 racketing home past low buildings some freezing night, 
172 come face to face with that broad roiling river. 
173 Nothing buried in her but is lit and transformed.174 
on a spring morning of young wood, green wood 175 
it will not burn, but the dreams burn. 176 My 
hands have ashes on them. 177 They fear it 178 
and so they destroy the nearest things.179 Running from death 
180 throwing his teeth at the ghost 181 dipping into 
his belly, staving off death with a throw 182 tearing 
his brains out, throwing them at Death 183 death-baby is 
being born 184 scythe clock and banner come 185 trumpet 
of bone and drum made of something --- 186 the 
callous-handed goddess 187 her kiss is resurrection188 The marker at 
Auschwitz 189 The scientists torturing male genitals 190 The learned 
scientists, they torture female genitals 191 The 3-year-old girl, what 
she did to her kitten 192 The collar made of 
leather for drowning a man in his chair 193 The 
scatter-bomb with the nails that drive into the brain 194 
The thread through the young man's splendid penis 195 The 
babies in flames. The thrust 196 Infected reptile dead in 
the live wombs of girls 197 We did not know 
we were insane. 198 We do not know we are 
insane. 199 We say to them : you are insane 
200 Anything you can imagine 201 on punishable drugs, or 
calm and young 202 with a fever of 105, or 
on your knees, 203 with the world of Hanoi bombed 
204 with the legless boy in Bach Mai 205 with 
the sons of man torn by man 206 Rational man 
has done. 207 Mercy, Lord. On every living life.208 In 
tall whirlpools of mirrors 209 Unshapen body and face 210 
middle of the depth 211 of a night that will 
not turn 212 the unshapen all night 213 trying for 
form214 I do and I do. 215 Life and this 
under-war. 216 Deep under protest, make. 217 For we are 
makers more.218 but touching teaching going 219 the young and 
the old 220 they reach they break they are moving 
221 to make the world222 something about desire 223 something 
about murder 224 something about my death 225 something about 
madness226 something about light 227 something of breaking open 228 
sing me to sleep and morning 229 my dreams are 
all a waking230 In the night 231 wandering room to 
room of this world 232 I move by touch 233 
and then something says 234 let the city pour 235 
the sleep of the beloved 236 Let the night pour 
down 237 all its meanings 238 Let the images pour 
239 the light is dreaming240 When I stand with these 
three 241 My new brothers my new sister 242 These 
who bind themselves offering 243 Hostages to go at a 
word, hostages 244 to go deeper here among our own 
cities 245 When I look into your faces 246 Karl, 
Martin, Andrea. 247 When I look into your faces 248 
Offered men and women, I can speak, 249 And I 
speak openly on the church steps, 250 At the peace 
center saying : We affirm 251 Our closeness forever with 
the eyes in Asia, 252 Those who resist the forces 
we resist. 253 One more hostage comes forward, his eyes: 
Joe, 254 With Karl, Martin, Andrea, me. 255 And now 
alone in the river-watching room, 256 Allen, your voice comes, 
the deep prophetic word. 257 And we are one more, 
Joe, Andrea, Karl, Martin, 258 Allen, me. The hostages. Reaching. 
Beginning.259 That I looked at them with my living eyes. 
260 That they looked at me with their living eyes. 
261 That we embraced. 262 That we began to learn 
each other's language.263 It is something like the breaking open 
of my youth 264 but unlike too, leading not only 
to consummation 265 of the bed and of the edge 
of the sea. 266 Although that, surely, also.267 But this 
music is 268 itself 269 needing only other selving 270 
It is defeated but a way is open: 271 transformation272 
Then came I entire to this moment 273 process and 
light 274 to discover the country of our waking 275 
breaking open
