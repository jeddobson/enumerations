1 "Long enough. Long enough," 2 I heard a woman 
say--- 3 I am that woman who too long 4 
Under the web lay. 5 Long enough in the empire 
6 Of his darkened eyes 7 Bewildered in the greying 
silver 8 Light of his fantasies. 9 I have been 
lying here too long, 10 From shadow-begin to shadow-began 11 
Where stretches over me the subtle 12 Rule of the 
Floating Man. 13 A young man and an old-young woman 
14 My dive in the river between 15 And rise, 
the children of another country; 16 That riverbank, that green. 
17 But too long, too long, too long 18 Is 
the journey through the ice 19 And too secret are 
the entrances 20 To my stretched hidingplace. 21 Walk out 
of the pudorweb 22 And into a lifetime 23 Said 
the woman; and I sleeper began to wake 24 And 
to say my own name.
