1 Long after you beat down the powerful hand 2 
and leave the scene, prison's still there to break. 3 
Brutalized by escape, you travel out to sit 4 in 
empty theatres, your stunned breast, hardened neck 5 waiting for 
warmth to venture back. 6 Gilded above the stage, staring 
archaic shapes 7 hang, like those men you learn submission 
from 8 whose majesty sits yellow on the night, 9 
young indolent girls, long-handed, one's vague mouth 10 and cruel 
nose and jaw and throat. 11 Waiting's paralysis strikes, king-cobra 
hooded head's 12 infected fangs petrify body and face. 13 
Emblems fade everyway, dissolving even 14 the bitter infantile boys 
who call for sleep's 15 winy breasts whose nipples are 
long grapes. 16 Seats fill. The curtain's up where strong 
lights act, 17 cut theatre to its theme; the quick 
fit's past. 18 Here's answer in masses moving; by light 
elect, 19 they turn the stage before into the street 
behind; 20 and nothing's so forgotten as your blind 21 
female paralysis that takes the mind, 22 and nothing's so 
forgotten as your dead 23 fever, now that it's past 
and the swift play's ahead.
