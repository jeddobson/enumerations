for Jane Cooper 1 Boys of these men 2 full 
speed across free, 3 my father's boyhood eyes. 4 Sail-skating 
with friends 5 bright on Wisconsin ice 6 those years 
away. 7 Sails strung across their backs 8 boys racing 
toward 9 fierce bitter middle-age 10 in the great glitter 
of 11 corrupted cities. 12 Father, your dark mouth 13 
speaking its rancor. 14 Alive not yet, the girl 15 
I would become stares 16 at that ice 17 stippled 
with skaters, 18 a story you tell. 19 Boys of 
those men 20 call across winter 21 where I stand 
and shake, 22 woman of that girl.
