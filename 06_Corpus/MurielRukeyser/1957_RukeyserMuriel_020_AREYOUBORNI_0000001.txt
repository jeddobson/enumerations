1 A man riding on the meaning of rivers 2 
Sang to me from the cloud of the world: 3 
Are you born? Are you born? 4 My name is 
gone into the burning heart 5 That knows the change 
deep in the form of things. 6 ---I saw from 
the treeline all our cities shine. 7 A woman riding 
on the moon of ocean 8 Sang to me through 
the cloud of the world: 9 Are you born? Are 
you born? 10 The form of growing in leaf and 
crystal flows, 11 And in the eyes and rivers of 
the land. 12 ---From the rock of our sky, I 
came to recognize. 13 A voice riding on the morning 
of air 14 Sang to me from the cloud of 
the world: 15 Are you born? Are you born? 16 
Bring all the singing home; 17 There is a word 
of lightning in the grass. 18 ---I stood alive in 
the young cloud.
