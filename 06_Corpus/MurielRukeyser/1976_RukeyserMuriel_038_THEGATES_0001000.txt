127 this mother will kill herself 128 But she is 
here, she lives, 129 the slender tines of this pitchfork 
standing in flames of light.130 You grief woman you gave 
me a scarlet coverlet 131 thick-sown with all the flowers 
132 and all the while your poet sleeps in stone 
133 Grief woman, the waves of this coverlet, 134 roses 
of Asia, 135 they flicker soft and bright over my 
sleep 136 all night while the poet waits in solitary 
137 All you vigil women, I start up in the 
night, 138 fling back this cover of red; 139 in 
long despair we work write speak pray call to others 
140 Free our night free our lives free our poet141 
Air fills with fear and the kinds of fear: 142 
The fear of the child among the tyrannical 143 unanswerable 
men and women, they dominate day and night. 144 Fear 
of the young lover in the huge rejection 145 ambush 
of sex and of imagination; 146 fear that the world 
will not allow your work. 147 Fear of the overarching 
wars and poverties, 148 the terrible exiles, 149 all bound 
by corruption until at last! we speak! 150 And those 
at home in jail who protest the frightful war 151 
and the beginning : The woman-guard says to me, Spread 
your 152 cheeks, 153 the search begins and I begin 
to know. 154 And also at home the nameless multitude 
155 of fears : fear in childbirth for the living 
child, 156 fear for the child deformed and love, fear 
157 among the surgeries that can cure her, fear 158 
for the child's father, and for oneself, fear. 159 Fear 
of the cunt and cock in their terrible powers 160 
and here a world away fear of the jailers' tortures 
161 for we invent our fear and act it out 
162 in ripping, in burning, in blood, in the terrible 
scream 163 and in tearing away every mouth that screams. 
164 Giant fears : massacres, the butchered that across the 
fields of 165 the world 166 lie screaming, and their 
screams are heard as silence. 167 O love, knowing your 
love across a world of fear, 168 I lie in 
a strange country, in pale yellow, swamp-green, woods 169 and 
a night of music while a poet lies in solitary 
170 somewhere in a concrete cell. Glare-lit, I hear, 171 
without books, without pen and paper. 172 Does he draw 
a pencil out of his throat, 173 out of his 
veins, out of his sex? 174 There are cells all 
around him, emptied. 175 He can signal on these walls 
till he runs mad. 176 He is signalling to me 
across the night. 177 He is signalling. Many of us 
speak, 178 we do teach each other, we do act 
through our fears. 179 Where is the world that will 
touch life to this prison? 180 We run through the 
night. We are given his gifts.181 Long ago, soon after 
my son's birth 182 ---this scene comes in arousal with 
the sight of a strong child 183 just beginning to 
run--- 184 when all life seemed prisoned off, because the 
father's other son 185 born three weeks before my child 
186 had opened the world 187 that other son and 
his father closed the world--- 188 in my fierce loneliness 
and fine well-being 189 torn apart but with my amazing 
child 190 I celebrated and grieved. 191 And before that 
baby 192 had ever started to begin to run 193 
then Mary said, 194 smiling and looking out of her 
Irish eyes, 195 "Never mind, Muriel. 196 Life will come 
will come again 197 knocking and coughing and farting at 
your door."198 For that I cannot name the names, 199 
my child's own father, the flashing, the horseman, 200 the 
son of the poet--- 201 for that he never told 
me another child was started, 202 to come to birth 
three weeks before my own. 203 Tragic timing that sets 
the hands of time. 204 O wind from our own 
coast, turning 205 around the turning world. 206 Wind from 
the continents, this other child, 207 child of this moment 
and this moment's poet. 208 Again I am struck nameless, 
unable to name, 209 and the axe-blows fall heavy heavy 
and sharp 210 and the moon strikes his white light 
down over the continents 211 on this strong infant and 
the heroic friends 212 silent in this terrifying moment under 
all moonlight, 213 all sunlight turning in all our unfree 
lands. 214 Name them, name them all, light of our 
own time.215 Crucified child---is he crucified? he is tortured, 216 
kept away from his father, spiked on time, 217 crucified 
we say, cut off from the man 218 they want 
to kill--- 219 he runs toward me in Asia, crying. 
220 Flash gives me my own son strong and those 
years ago 221 cut off from his own father and 
running toward me 222 holding a strong flower. 223 Child 
of this moment, you are your father's child 224 wherever 
your father is prisoned, by what tyrannies 225 or jailed 
as my child's father 226 by his own fantasies--- 227 
child of the age running among the world, 228 standing 
among us who carry our own time.229 So I became 
very dark very large 230 a silent woman this time 
given to speech 231 a woman of the river of 
that song 232 and on the beach of the world 
in storm given 233 in long lightning seeing the rhyming 
of those scenes 234 that make our lives. 235 Anne 
Sexton the poet saying 236 ten days ago to that 
receptive friend, 237 the friend of the hand-held camera: 238 
"Muriel is serene." 239 Am I that in their sight? 
240 Word comes today of Anne's 241 of Anne's long-approaching 
242 of Anne's over-riding over-falling 243 suicide. Speak for sing 
for pray for 244 everyone in solitary 245 every living
