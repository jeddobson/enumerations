1 Not leaves, not lightning, not that greatness of rivers. 
2 The hand and spirit volunteer. 3 We think to 
build again, finer nor before. 4 The water-spiral turns the 
fire 5 Broken upon the miles of air, 6 Leaps 
through our furnaces of change 7 To make and make. 
8 The great sun pours his power down. 9 Â¶ 
Water power is really a form of sun power .
