1 M-Day's child is fair of face, 2 Drill-day's child 
is full of grace, 3 Gun-day's child is breastless and 
blind, 4 Shell-day's child is out of its mind, 5 
Bomb-day's child will always be dumb, 6 Cannon-day's child can 
never quite come, 7 But the child that's born on 
the Battle-day 8 is blithe and bonny and rotted away.
