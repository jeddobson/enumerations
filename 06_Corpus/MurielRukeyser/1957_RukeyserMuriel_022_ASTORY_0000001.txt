There is a child. He comes from far. By boats 
and trains, cities that move, houses that sail away. He 
comes from the country of war to a field at 
peace. Day lilies, yellow daisies, Queen Anne's lace. A barrel, 
a box of sand. He is four years old; he 
looks up into Miss Lorence's eyes. Many children, playing. 2 
CHILD: Look, look! 3 MISS LORENCE: Yes. l'm looking. 4 
CHILD: I'm way up in the sky! 5 ND CHILD: 
Moo, moo. I don't like you. 6 CHILD: I do 
magic. 7 ND CHILD: What magic? 8 CHILD: Want to 
see? 9 I do magic very well. 10 Step there. 
Put one foot there. 11 Now I need the latter. 
12 Hold it! (To the young woman) 13 What's your 
name? 14 MISS LORENCE: Miss Lorence. What's yours? 15 CHILD: 
Paul. 16 MISS LORENCE: Paul is slight, Paul is small. 
17 Paul wants to feel, he wants to smell, 18 
He wants to taste, to see. hear. Everything. 19 He 
is slight, his eyes blaze blue, 20 White-skinned, cocky, knobby, 
as 21 Fragile as a closed-down spring. 22 PAUL: Where 
is father? 23 MISS LORENCE: Far. Your mother does not 
know. 24 It is the war. It is the war. 
25 PAUL: Who is Hitler? 26 What is sound? 27 
How does it feel to die? 28 What does a 
worm think? Miss Lorence? 29 How long does it take 
to grow up? 30 Miss Lorence---I will talk to you. 
31 The little house I like, the kitten I like. 
32 It went to a little wood, to a little 
Paul, 33 When it came to Paul it cried. 34 
In a basket, like Paul the baby, in far land. 
35 To Paul's father. The father of Paul 36 Kissed 
the kitty and cried. 37 Unhappy was he. Why is 
he? 38 Because I have no kitty, because the father 
39 Of Paul is in a far country. 40 Not 
in this town is he, 41 Not in this house, 
42 Not in the room or the bedroom. 43 Far 
away, far away. When will he come to us, 44 
When will we be happy, seeing him company? 45 Not 
for long, for long, for long. 46 Cry we, for 
it is a long time, and far away.
