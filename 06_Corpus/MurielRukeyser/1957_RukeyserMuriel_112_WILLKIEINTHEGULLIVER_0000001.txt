1 When after the screens of the evening of defeat 
2 You try the remote clean air, withdrawal, think of 
him. 3 He was like many of us. He had 
lost. 4 He flew to the many, making a crisis 
of choice 5 Lead toward the solving of barriers; learning, 
flying, crossed 6 Level after level of process, where we 
come 7 To ourselves, to the voiceless many who never 
in time 8 Choose against life. We find the direct 
voice. 9 Remembering limits, in the days of death, 10 
All the faring that follows our first sight of the 
face 11 Of all things beginning again past deepest defeat. 
12 Think now all of us of our loved and 
great, 13 Traveling new to make human the bonds of 
breath 14 After defeat; for all men; by God's grace.
