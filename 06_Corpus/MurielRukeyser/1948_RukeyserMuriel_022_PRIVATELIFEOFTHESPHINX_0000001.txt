1 Simply because of a question, my life is implicated: 
2 my flesh and answer fly between chaos and their 
need. 3 On the rock I asked the shaky king 
4 one foolish question to make him look at himself--- 
5 He looked. Beheld himself and kingdoms. Took. 6 My 
claws and smile transferred into his myth. 7 Babble of 
demand, and answers building the brilliant cities 8 the standing 
battlefields and the fields of the fallen down. 9 Now 
in this city in the Lounge of Time, 10 I 
tell you it was a legend founded on fire, 11 
founded on what we are. Simply because I asked one 
12 question, 13 "What is this, What?" so that the 
answer must be "Man." 14 Because of that they bring 
their riddles and rhyme 15 to my door if I 
houseless run throughout the world, 16 torse of a woman 
and quarters of a lion.17 Open war with its images 
of love and death--- 18 man, an explosion walking through 
the night in 19 rich and intolerable loneliness. 20 Cathedrals 
writhing gold against their clouds 21 and a child asking 
the fiery pure questions. 22 The monkey-dark, a month of 
smoky violets, 23 delicate repose of my reality among 24 
dreams, and the angel of the resurrection, 25 a mouth 
overhead, the sky planted with stars. 26 My questions are 
my body. And among this glowing, this sure, 27 this 
fact, this mooncolored breast, I make memorial.28 My body is 
set against disorder. Risen among enigmas, 29 time and the 
question carry a rose of form, 30 sing a life-song. 
Strangler and bitch, they said, 31 but they mistook the 
meaning of my name: 32 I am the root who 
embraces and the source. 33 I sing. I sing. 34 
In these cities, all suffer from their weaknesses--- 35 they 
lack some gut, they are ill, they have womb-envy, 36 
run howling from the question and the act. 37 They 
bring me their need for answers in their hands and 
38 eyes. 39 To embody truth, the Irish old man 
said. 40 I remember in Calabria a peasant 41 broad, 
smiling, and sly, with a bird throbbing and small 42 
behind his back, in his hands; and he asked his 
question. 43 Is it alive? and he smiled at me. 
Then I knew 44 if I said Yes, he would 
twist the sparrow's neck. 45 The fool of time! I 
gave him my only answer, 46 that answer of time: 
47 Fool, I said, you know it depends on you 
48 whether it live or die.49 I answer! I fly 
reborn from deep escape! 50 Listen to their cries, the 
selfsame crying throats, 51 crying the selfsame need. 52 Here 
is my self. I touch you, life reaches me. 53 
You touch me, I am able to give my gifts. 
54 All the acts flow together, a form being made. 
55 I know a garden beyond questioning--- 56 can almost 
see night-flowering white mallows, 57 can almost tell you below 
the sound of water, 58 white lilac like a voluptuous 
light 59 shining at full on our two faces.--- 60 
It goes ahead of our hope. It is the secret 
that moves 61 with the speed of life, 62 secrets 
of night and the street 63 secrets of milk and 
dinner and daylight, 64 enigmas of gardens, the kitchen and 
the bed, 65 the riddle and sacrament in the knot 
of wood, 66 in the wine, in the water and 
root the coil of life. 67 They ask for answers, 
they starving eat their shadows. 68 The beginning is always 
here. Its green demand.69 They think I answer and strangle. 
They are wrong. 70 I set my life among the 
questioning. 71 The peasant, the wars, the wounded powerful king. 
72 The shining of questions which cannot be concealed 73 
lies in that mirror. The little child to the mother 
74 of the father's unspoken death, said : "You have 
told me 75 yourself." 76 Even alone, away from daily 
life, the fire 77 and monster crown of the legend 
over me 78 reaches their eyes---children, friendship of lions, 79 
the sense of the world at last broken through to 
man 80 in all fury, all sacred open mystery, 81 
is in my question. 82 The stranger, the foreign and 
strong, 83 the child and king, wide village eyes of 
the farm, 84 the demand loud, or choking in surf-foam, 
85 density of flowers, the faces of all love, 86 
the core of our hope; stronger than kill, 87 stronger 
almost than question, almost than song.
