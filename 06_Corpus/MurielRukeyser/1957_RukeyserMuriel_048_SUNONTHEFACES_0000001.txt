1 Sun on the faces. On the knotted rocks. 2 
Sun on the iron. Sun on the dust of the 
roads. 3 The ravel of cloud, the silver chalkings of 
track 4 Lying westward through the dappled pass 5 South 
of the city where the mist flowed in. 6 Distance 
and the crowd. 7 The train goes dark-green westward 8 
Over the free, light-gray crystals of rock. 9 Early morning 
the moment of thin air 10 a.m. and the cattle 
lying down 11 And all the cattle get up from 
their knees. 12 Early morning, the chill before the sun 
13 And eleven men standing at a railroad crossing 14 
The arm of the signal swinging Stop red Look red 
Listen. 15 Stop. People standing, looking separate in the morning 
air. 16 The little river over speckled stones 17 Passing 
the section crew. They wave. They wave. 18 The iceman 
and the gandy dancers, 19 And three blasts on the 
whistle for a penny. 20 In the smoke cities, sitting 
on the fences, 21 They shine in their leather, but 
they make no sign. 22 They hear the speaking in 
a pause of worlds 23 Roaring, in the haze roaring, 
in the stench 24 Of the slaughter of animals he 
roars. They make no sign. 25 In their stained aprons 
they listen, standing; they turn 26 Back to the cool 
immense bloodyards. 27 His voice 28 Diminishing down the raspit 
avenues. Promises 29 Individual Man, but vaguely, and the vague 
cities 30 Promised, and downward through industrial 31 Illinois, vaguely, 
and 32 through the blaze of town 33 Downstate, glowing, 
the summer leaves, the faces 34 Lit by September and 
inlit by the deep 35 Summer-end need for spiritual change. 
36 The hoarse raven 37 Croaks in his throat, Rock 
Island, the swaying 38 Train carries these panicky friends, advisers 
of symptoms, 39 Sending their telegrams.
