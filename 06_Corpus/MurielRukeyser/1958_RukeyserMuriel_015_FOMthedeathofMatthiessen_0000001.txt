1 It was much stronger than they said. Noisier. 2 
Everything in it more colored. Wilder. 3 More at the 
center calm. 4 Everything was more violent than ever they 
said, 5 Who tried to guard us from suicide and 
life. 6 We in our wars were more than they 
had told us. 7 Now that descent figures stand about 
the horizon, 8 I have begun to see the living 
faces, 9 The storm, the morning, all more than they 
ever said. 10 Of the new dead, that friend who 
died today, 11 Angel of suicides, gather him in now. 
12 Defend us from doing what he had to do 
13 Who threw himself away.
