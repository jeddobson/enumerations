1 The night is covered with signs. The body and 
face of man, 2 with signs, and his journeys. Where 
the rock is split 3 and speaks to the water; 
the flame speaks to the cloud; 4 the red splatter, 
abstraction, on the door 5 speaks to the angel and 
the constellations. 6 The grains of sand on the sea-floor 
speak at last to the noon. 7 And the loud 
hammering of the land behind 8 speaks ringing up the 
bones of our thighs, the hoofs, 9 we hear the 
hoofs over the seethe of the sea. 10 All night 
down the centuries, have heard, music of passage. 11 Music 
of one child carried into the desert; 12 firstborn forbidden 
by law of the pyramid. 13 Drawn through the water 
with the water-drawn people 14 led by the water-drawn man 
to the smoke mountain. 15 The voice of the world 
speaking, the world covered by signs, 16 the burning, the 
loving, the speaking, the opening. 17 Strong throat of sound 
from the smoking mountain. 18 Still flame, the spoken singing 
of a young child. 19 The meaning beginning to move, 
which is the song. 20 Music of those who have 
walked out of slavery. 21 Into that journey where all 
things speak to all things 22 refusing to accept the 
curse, and taking 23 for signs the signs of all 
things, the world, the body 24 which is part of 
the soul, and speaks to the world, 25 all creation 
being created in one image, creation. 26 This is not 
the past walking into the future, 27 the walk is 
painful, into the present, the dance 28 not visible as 
dance until much later. 29 These dancers are discoverers of 
God. 30 We knew we had all crossed over when 
we heard the song. 31 Out of a life of 
building lack on lack: 32 the slaves refusing slavery, escaping 
into faith: 33 an army who came to the ocean: 
the walkers 34 who walked through the opposites, from I 
to opened Thou, 35 city and cleave of the sea. 
Those at flaming Nauvoo, 36 the ice on the great 
river: the escaping Negroes, 37 swamp and wild city: the 
shivering children of Paris 38 and the glass black hearses; 
those on the Long March: 39 all those who together 
are the frontier, forehead of man. 40 Where the wilderness 
enters, the world, the song of the world. 41 Akiba 
rescued, secretly, in the clothes of death 42 by his 
disciples carried from Jerusalem 43 in blackness journeying to find 
his journey 44 to whatever he was loving with his 
life. 45 The wilderness journey through which we move 46 
under the whirlwind truth into the new, 47 the only 
accurate. A cluster of lights at night: 48 faces before 
the pillar of fire. A child watching 49 while the 
sea breaks open. This night. The way in. 50 Barbarian 
music, a new song. 51 Acknowledging opened water, possibility: 52 
open like a woman to this meaning. 53 In a 
time of building statues the stars, 54 valuing certain partial 
ferocious skills 55 while past us the chill and immense 
wilderness 56 spreads its one-color wings until we know 57 
rock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea, 
58 the world is a sign, a way of speaking. 
To find. 59 What shall we find? Energies, rhythms, journey. 
60 Ways to discover. The song of the way in.
