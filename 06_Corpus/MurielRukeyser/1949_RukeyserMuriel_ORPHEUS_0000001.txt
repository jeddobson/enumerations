1 The mountaintop stands in silence a minute after the 
murder. 2 The women are furies racing down the slope; 
far down, 3 copper and black of hair, the white 
heel running, escaped line 4 of skirt and foot, 5 
among the leaves and needles of these witness trees. Overhead, 
6 clouds, lions and towers of the sky. 7 Darkness 
masses among the treetops; dense shapes bulk among 8 treetops 
over the murdered ground, stain of light glancing on the 
jointed branches. 9 Light of water, blaze of the comet-tailed 
stars. 10 The scene is the mountain, just after the 
murder, with a dry concentrated moon 11 rocking back and 
forth between the crowns of trees, back and forth, until 
over this black crown, 12 attacking the sharp black and 
the secrecy, moon comes to rest. 13 And the exhausted 
14 women are streaming down the paths at the foot 
of the mountain, 15 now fleeing, 16 now halted by 
the sleep that follows murder. 17 From this moment, the 
darkness fills the walls of rivers, 18 and the walls 
of houses and in the villages 19 the walls, the 
olive groves, remembrances and pillars 20 of dark. Murder. Scattered 
and done. 21 Down in his blood on a holy 
mountaintop. 22 All the voices are done; very deep, they 
rest, they are alone. 23 Only the breath around the 
earth moves, in a slow rested rhythm, 24 as the 
moon 25 comes to rest over that treepoint swaying like 
the breast 26 of an escaping woman. Down 27 from 
the moon one cloud falls and it passes, sails upon 
28 this place in the forest where the god is 
slain. 29 These golden breasts have troubled heaven. 30 But 
they are breasts of tears; their act is done; and 
down, 31 here on wet ground, scattered, the flowing man. 
32 Scattered, there lit, in black and golden blood : 
33 his hand, a foot, a flat breast, phallus, a 
foot, 34 shoulder and sloping back and lyre and murdered 
head. 35 Hacked, stopped, he bleeds with the long dayblood's 
life. 36 Has bled until the moon cleared range and 
rose, female and male, 37 shining on treetops and water 
and on the pieces of a man. 38 Very quiet, 
the trees awake. And find their voices. But 39 the 
clouds are first, they have begun their song 40 over 
these air-cut, over these river-cut mountains--- 41 Lost! they build 
the sound of Lost! the dark level clouds 42 voice 
under voice arranged in white arpeggios 43 on the high 
air, the statement of the sky 44 rides across, very 
high, very cIear, 45 singing Lost; lost man. 46 And 
the river falls among the plunging forests, 47 the heartshaped 
waterfall goes down like the fall of man 48 seeking, 
and crying one word, earth's water speaking of harvest. 49 
But moon says No : in finished night the great 
moon overrides, 50 promising new moons only, saying I know 
no harvests--- 51 My harvest, declares in whiteness, are the 
tides to come. 52 These words are called in a 
silence 53 over the scattered man. 54 The clouds move, 
the river moves, 55 the great moon slowly moves; even 
more slowly now, 56 the first finger of the right 
hand. 57 The right hand stirred in the small grass 
and said 58 "Do more; for this is how it 
is," and died again.59 Scattered. The fool of things. For 
here is Orpheus, 60 without his origin : the body, 
mother of self, 61 the earliest self, the mother of 
permanence. 62 He is sensation and matter, all forms and 
no form. 63 He is the pieces of Orpheus and 
he is chaos. 64 All myths are within the body 
when it is most whole, 65 all positions being referred 
to flesh in unity, 66 slow changes of form, the 
child and growing man 67 as friends have seen him, 
altered by absences and years. 68 Scatterings cannot discern changes 
of quality : 69 This scattered on the mountain is 
no man 70 but body as circus. 71 Sideshow of 
parts, the freaks of Orpheus. 72 The wounds : Touch 
me! Love me! Speak to me! 73 The hand risen 
to reap, standing upon its wrist 74 and singing, "I 
will do," among its dreams. 75 The hunter eye in 
the forest, going mad. 76 The waste and shed of 
song that ritual made, 77 and the wandering, loss of 
forms, the darkened light, 78 as the eye said: 79 
I looked at night, to rainbow-crested moon, 80 as to 
round-crested sun I looked at day. 81 Stare that fertilizes 
the threshold of square Hell, 82 stare pacing the forest, 
staring the death away. 83 Give everything. Ask not beyond 
the daily light. 84 I shine, am reflected in all 
that is and will be, 85 names, surfaces, the void 
where light is born. 86 There was something I saw. 
Something not to be seen. 87 But I cannot remember; 
and I cannot see. 88 The wounds : Touch me! 
Speak to me! Love me! 89 In darklit death, the 
strong pyramid heart 90 knows something of the source, the 
maze of blood 91 the deeper fountains and dance of 
certain colors. 92 Something was founded at the base of 
the heart, 93 it cannot find it now, but the 
blood's pilgrimage 94 carries its relics and the sacred banners 
95 far from this mountaintop to the beating valves of 
the sea. 96 It cannot clench. 97 There was song, 
and the tomb of song, 98 there was love, but 
it all escapes. What love? For whom? 99 The wounds 
: Speak to me! 100 The arm that living held 
the lyre 101 understands touch me, the thrill of string 
on hand 102 saying to fingers Who am I? 103 
Father of songs, 104 when all the doors are open, 
105 beyond the clasp of power, 106 the mastery of
