1 Configurations of time and singing 2 Bring me to 
a dark harbor where 3 The chase is drawn to 
a beginning. 4 And all the myths are gathered there. 
5 I know the trees as fountains and the stars' 
6 Far fires fountains and your love 7 A vivid 
fountain, and the bars 8 Broken about me let me 
move 9 Among the fountains. At last seeing 10 I 
came here by obscure preparing, 11 In vigils and encounters 
being 12 Both running hunter and fierce prey waring. 13 
I hunted and became the followed, 14 Through many lives 
fleeing the last me, 15 And changing fought down a 
far road 16 Through time to myself as I will 
be. 17 Chaos prepared me, and I find the track, 
18 Through life and darkness seek my myth--- 19 Move 
toward it, hunting grow more like, 20 Draw near, and 
know it through our path. 21 Know only that we 
run one path.
