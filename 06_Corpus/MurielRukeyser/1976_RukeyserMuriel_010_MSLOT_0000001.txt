1 Well, if he treats me like a young girl 
still, 2 That father of mine, and here's my sister 
3 And we're still traveling into the hills--- 4 But 
everyone on the road knows he offered us 5 To 
the Strangers when all they wanted was men, 6 And 
the cloud of smoke still over the twin cities 7 
And mother a salt lick the animals come to--- 8 
Who's going to want me now? 9 Mother did not 
even know 10 She was not to turn around and 
look. 11 God spoke to Lot, my father. 12 She 
was hard of hearing. He knew that. 13 I don't 
believe he told her, anyway. 14 What kind of father 
is that, or husband? 15 He offered us to those 
men. They didn't want women. 16 Mother always used to 
say: 17 Some normal man will come along and need 
you.
