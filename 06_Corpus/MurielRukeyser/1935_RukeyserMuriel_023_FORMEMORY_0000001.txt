1 Open with care the journal of those years 2 
firm years precipitating days to death 3 This was my 
friend walking in color and flame 4 walking through a 
texture of sense 5 no breath 6 deranges her fine 
hair no voice changes her face. 7 It is hardly 
possible she will not come again 8 returned for a 
short while out of distances 9 to be re-given to 
distance and her loves. 10 It is hardly truth to 
say that soon 11 a letter will not come, postmarked 
Detroit, 12 New Orleans, Chicago, ultimate Mexico. 13 I think 
she must come, and go, and come again. 14 Throatfuls 
of life, arms crammed with brilliant days, 15 the colored 
years beat strength upon her youth, 16 pain-bombs exploded her 
body, joy rocketed in her, 17 the stranger forests, the 
books, the bitter times, 18 preluded college in a sheltered 
town. 19 Remembering the pale suede jacket and russet coat 
20 swinging down avenues of trees together, 21 the nights 
of talk light cast from copper bowls, 22 the fugitive 
journey to the coal-hills : names, 23 Del Thomas, Tony 
Mancuso, Mrs. Silva, 24 the black river curdling under a 
midnight wind. 25 Remembering how the pale wrists flickered love, 
26 the dark eye-sockets impelled her to the poor, 27 
ring changes 28 tell of the loves in her life 
29 tell how she loved. 30 This was my friend 
of whom I knew the face 31 the steel-straight intellect, 
broidered fantastic dreams 32 the quarrel by the lake 33 
and knew the hopes 34 She died. And must be 
dead. 35 And is not dead where memory prevails. 36 
Cut the stone, deepen her name. 37 Her mother did 
not know her. 38 Her friends were not enough, we 
missed essentials. 39 Love was enough and its blossoms. Behind 
her life 40 stands a tall flower-tree, around her life 
41 are worked her valid words into her testament 42 
of love and writing and a ring of love.43 Across 
the country, iron hands push up chimneys 44 black fingers 
stuck up from the blackened ground. 45 The rivers bend 
seaward urgent in blue reaches; 46 her pain turned seaward. 
Her life extended past 47 the sea, the cities, the 
individual poor, 48 passionate and companioned, following life. 49 Through 
the bright years reckless and proud 50 dimming into that 
last impossible pain. 51 We cannot think she will not 
come again. 52 The words lean on the written line, 
the page 53 is a signal fire all the letters 
shine. 54 Into this life is lowered now death's sign, 
55 the younger days flicker up, the poems burn, 56 
we cannot say Return 57 Slowly her death is propelled 
into our lives 58 the yellow message the clipped convenient 
style 59 the cancelled stamps the telephone wires ring 60 
confirming fear "You were right" : in a week's short 
while. 61 Her love was never handcuffed, her hates spoke 
up, 62 her life was a job of freedom. 63 
Now the news comes, the Times prints a 64 name 
65 the telephone rings short music over her. 66 Drink 
your coffee, open your throat for words. 67 Loving, she 
died in passion and holiness. 68 They share remorse who 
had required less.69 Last night she died 70 Turn down 
the lamps tonight 71 shade the walls 72 let the 
proud voices rise 73 out of the midnight street, the 
whistle flying 74 up and along and flying in the 
street 75 the harsh struck stone, a brake squealing the 
pause 76 and the brave silence after a lapse of 
sound. 77 Turn out the lights 78 Her body does 
not move 79 is striding over no hill in all 
the world 80 there is no avenue in Illinois shall 
know 81 the eager mouth, the fine voluptuous hands 82 
touch no more Mexicos in dream again. 83 There was 
a shadow deep along her cheek, 84 her eyes and 
hair were intricate with sun. 85 Now lights are out. 
86 : Stand to me in the dark 87 Set 
your mouth on me for friends we did not know 
88 Be strong in love 89 give strength to all 
we meet 90 the loving the kind the proletarian strong 
91 convey our love to her in the grey fields 
92 less grey for her, send her our breathing lives. 
93 This was my friend 94 forget the "my," speak 
out 95 This was my friend who eager rash and 
brave 96 has found one answer in an early grave. 
97 This is my body : in its youth I 
find 98 strength given from the startle of her mind. 
99 If we have strength in this evening, force life 
between her lips 100 seal it convey it post it 
the sheet discolored 101 the ink already fading 102 the 
dead words fading 103 the dead all dead. 104 Out 
of the South are vivid flowers sent, 105 African daisies, 
red anemone : 106 here are the riches of a 
continent, 107 and intellectual gifts breaking you free, 108 poetry 
sounding in the narrow skull 109 sealing the sutures with 
music, smoothing the cheek 110 with vocable comfort the long 
hands of sorrow. 111 The full-blown flowers are given : 
our hands are 112 full of flowers and gestures : 
across New England dunes 113 where the stiff grasses rise 
against the sea, 114 across the city the dark-red roofs, 
the stone, 115 across the Alleghanies, down the Valley 116 
the air speaks plenty the words have all been spoken. 
117 Upon what skies are these ambitions written? 118 across 
what field lies scattered the young wish, 119 beneath what 
seas toll all those fallen dreams---?
