1 But this is our desire, and of its worth.... 
2 Power electric-clean, gravitating outward at all points, 3 moving 
in savage fire, fusing all durable stuff 4 but never 
itself being fused with any force 5 homing in no 
hand nor breast nor sex 6 for buried in these 
lips we rise again, 7 bent over these plans, our 
faces raise to see. 8 Direct spears are shot outward 
from the conscience 9 fulfilling what far circuits? Orbit of 
thought 10 what axis do you lean on, what strictnesses 
evade 11 impelled to the long curves of the will's 
ambition? 12 Centrifugal power, expanding universe 13 within expanding universe, 
what stillnesses 14 lie at your center resting among motion? 
15 Study communications, looking inward, find what traffic 16 you 
may have with your silences : looking outward, survey 17 
what you have seen of places : 18 many times 
this week I seemed 19 to hear you speak my 
name 20 how you turn the flatnesses 21 of your 
cheek and will not hear my words 22 then reaching 
the given latitude 23 and longitude, we searched for the 
ship and found nothing 24 and, gentlemen, shall we define 
desire 25 including every impulse toward psychic progress? 26 Roads 
are cut into the earth leading away from our place 
27 at the inevitable hub. All directions are out , 
28 all desire turns outward : we, introspective, 29 continuing 
to find in ourselves the microcosm 30 imaging continents, powers, 
relations, reflecting 31 all history in a bifurcated Engine. 32 
Here is the gyroscope whirling out pulsing in tides illimitably 
33 widening, live force contained 34 in a sphere of 
rigid boundary ; concentrate 35 at the locus of all 
forces, spinning with black speed 36 revolving outward perpetually, turning 
with its torque 37 all the developments of the secret 
will. 38 Flaming origins were our fathers in the heat 
of the earth, 39 pushing to the crust, water and 
sea-flesh, 40 undulant tentacles ingrown on the ocean's floor, 41 
frondy anemones and scales' armor gave us birth. 42 Bring 
us to air, ancestors! and we breathed 43 the young 
flesh wincing against naked December. 44 Masters of fire, fire 
gave us riches, gave us life. 45 Masters of water, 
water gave us riches, gave us life, 46 masters of 
earth, earth gave us riches, gave us life. 47 Air 
mocks, and desire whirls outward in strict frenzy, leaping, 48 
elastic widening from the mind, 49 turning constricted to the 
mind again. 50 The dynamics of desire are explained 51 
in terms of action outward and reaction to a core 
52 obscured and undefined, except, perhaps, as "God in Heaven," 
53 "God in Man," 54 Elohim intermittent with the soul, 
recurrent 55 as Father and Holy Ghost, Word and responsive 
Word, 56 merging with contact in continual sunbursts, 57 the 
promise, the response, the hands laid on, 58 the hammer 
swung to the anvil, mouth fallen on mouth, 59 the 
plane nose up into an open sky. 60 Roads are 
cut, purchase is gained on our wish, 61 the turbines 
gather momentum, tools are given : 62 whirl in desire, 
hurry to ambition, return, 63 maintaining the soul's polarity ; 
be : fly.
