1 Pieces of animals, pieces of all my friends 2 
prepare assassinations while I sleep. 3 They shape my being, 
a gallery of lives 4 fighting within me, and all 
unreconciled. 5 Before them move my waking dreams, and ways 
6 of the spirit, and simple action. Among these 7 
I can be well and holy. Torn by them I 
am wild, 8 smile, and revenge myself upon my friends 
9 and find myself among my enemies. 10 But all 
these forms of incompleteness pass 11 out of their broken 
power to a place 12 where dream and dream meet 
and resolve in grace. 13 The closing of this conflict 
is the end 14 of the initiation. I have known 
the cliff 15 and known the cliff-dream of the faces 
drowned. 16 Stood in the high sun, a dark girl 
looking down, 17 seeing the colors of water swaying beneath 
me, dense 18 in the flood-summer, various as my love 
19 and like my hope enchanted. Drawn to blue 20 
chance and horizons, and back as sea-grasses move 21 drawn 
landward slowly by incoming tides--- 22 and then the final 
cancelling and choice, 23 not tilted as flowers under wind, 
but deep 24 blessing of root and heart, underwater swung, 
25 wrenched, swayed, and given fully to the sea. 26 
Heaven not of rest, but of intensity. 27 The forms 
of incompleteness in our land 28 pass from the eastern 
and western mountains where 29 the seas meet the dark 
islands, where the light 30 glitters white series on the 
snowlands, pours its wine 31 of lenient evening to the 
center. Green 32 on shadows of Indiana, level yellow miles 
... 33 The prairie emblems and the slopes of the 
sky 34 and desert stars enlarging in the frost 35 
redeem us like our love and will not die. 36 
All origins are here, and in this range 37 the 
changing spirit can make itself again, 38 continually love, continually 
change. 39 Our of the myth the mother leaned; 40 
From out the mother shines the child; 41 Man rises, 
in the mass contained; 42 And from this growth creation 
grows. 43 The fire through all the spiral flows : 
44 Create the creative, many-born! 45 And use your love, 
unreconciled! 46 In wheels, in whirlwind, in a storm of 
power 47 alive again and over every land 48 the 
thunderbird with lightnings at his wrists. 49 Eclipses uncloud and 
show us miracle, 50 gleaming, our ancestors, all antagonists: 51 
Slave and Conquistador, dead hand-to-hand, 52 scented fastidious Tory with 
his whore, 53 distinguished rebel and woman at the plow. 
54 The fiery embryo umbilical 55 always to failure, and 
form developing 56 American out of conflict. 57 Fierce dissenting 
ghosts, 58 the second Adams' fever and eagle voice 59 
and Jackson's muscular democratic sense. 60 Sprung in one birth 
John Brown, a mad old man 61 whose blood in 
a single broken gesture freed 62 many beliefs; and Lincoln's 
agony 63 condemning and confirming. O, they cry, 64 the 
oppositions cry, O fight for me! 65 Fight, you are 
bound to freedom, and be free! 66 When Hawthorne saw 
the fabulous gift, he tore 67 flesh from his guilt, 
and found more guilt; the bells 68 rang barter of 
the self, but Melville drowned. 69 The doubled phantoms bring 
to our terrible 70 chaos the order of a meeting-place 
71 where the exchange is made, the agonies 72 lie 
down at last together face to face. 73 In the 
black night of blood, the forms begin 74 to glitter 
alive, fathers of constellations, 75 the shining and the music 
moving on. 76 We are bound by the deepest feuds 
to unity. 77 To make the connections and be born 
again, 78 create the creative. that will love the world. 
79 Not glistening Indies, not continents, but the world 80 
opening now, and the greatness of our age 81 that 
makes its own antagonists of the wish. 82 We want 
to find and will spend our lives in finding: 83 
the landfall of our broken voyages 84 is still our 
America of contradictions. 85 Ancestors of that dream lie coupled 
in our flesh, 86 pieces of animals, pieces of all 
our friends 87 meet in us and we live. We 
do not die. 88 Magical keen Magellan sought a rose 
89 among the compass and legendary winds. 90 Green sequels 
rocked his eyes in water; he 91 hung with the 
scorpion sun on noon's glass wall, 92 stared down, down 
into the future as he sailed. 93 Fanatic travels, recurrent 
mysteries. 94 Those who want the far shore spend their 
lives on the ocean. 95 The hand of God flowers 
in coasts for these. 96 Those who want only home 
spend their lives in the sky. 97 Flying over tonight, 
while thirteen searchlights join 98 high incandescent asters on black 
air. 99 The blinding center fastens on a plane 100 
floating and white, glare-white; he wanting land 101 and intimate 
fertile hours, hangs there. Sails 102 great scends of danger, 
or wades through crazy sand. 103 Those who most long 
for peace now pour their lives on war. 104 Our 
conflicts carry creation and its guilt, 105 these years' great 
arms are full of death and flowers. 106 A world 
is to be fought for, sung, and built: 107 Love 
must imagine the world. 108 The wish of love 109 
moving upon the body of love describes 110 closing of 
conflict, repeats the sacred ways 111 in which the spirit 
dances and survives. 112 To that far meeting-place call home 
the enemies--- 113 they keep their oppositions, for the strong 
114 ironic joy of old intensities 115 still carries virile 
music. 116 O, the young 117 will come up 118 
after us 119 and make the dream, 120 the real 
world of our myth. 121 But now, the song 122 
they will discover is a shadowy theme--- 123 Today we 
are bound, for freedom binds us---we 124 live out the 
conflict of our time, until 125 Love, finding all the 
antagonists in the dance, 126 moved by its moods and 
given to its grace, 127 resolves the doom 128 and 
the deliverance.
