1 A bird flew out of a cloud 2 (with 
a beak, flying), 3 broke its beak on my bone, 
4 cried bird-cries over crying. 5 Sky, stranger, wilderness 6 
(flying starry through flesh), 7 make an end; be me, 
bird. 8 It reverses my one wish. 9 Bird screams 
slavery among bones. 10 (I watch with a bird's eyes.) 
11 Quarrel, wings; if I travel, 12 bird stays---stand, bird 
flies. 13 Bird sets feathers where flesh was 14 (my 
claws slide away on space). 15 Bird, here---now, bird, we 
fly! 16 Mourns, mourns, it turns a captive face.17 A 
sound lying on the fantastic air 18 opens the night 
and the child is born; 19 as the wind moves, 
the solemn crying 20 pioneers in the air, changes 21 
to flame crusading among the grasses 22 fire-whitened, aroused before 
it, 23 rippled crops---and blazing races 24 into a central 
arena 25 where it stands as a fighting-cock 26 conqueror 
head, aggressive spur, 27 and the gilt feather, the bronze, 
the greenish, 28 flicker and threaten. 29 The feathers of 
the fighting-cock 30 become a tree, and casting seed, 31 
raise potent forests at its side--- 32 birth among burning. 
33 The great magnetic branches sign 34 meaning on the 
record sky--- 35 now rise, moon, stiffen, bird, and flames, 
36 kill and engender. 37 Reversal, chameleon, 38 pursuing images--- 
39 recurrent birth offering other names, 40 a spool of 
brightness.41 This is a tall woman walking through a square 
42 thinking what is a woman at midnight in a 
park 43 under bells, in the trivial and lovely hours 
44 with images, violins, dancers approaching? 45 This is a 
woman sitting at a mirror 46 her back to the 
glass and all the dancers advancing, 47 or in a 
chair laughing at a bone 48 sitting upright in a 
chair 49 talking of ballet, flesh's impermanence. 50 This is 
a woman looking at a stage--- 51 dancer receiving the 
floral blue and white, 52 balanced against a tallest blue 
decor, 53 dancing---and all the parks, walks, hours 54 descend 
in brilliant water past the eyes 55 pursuing and forgotten 
and subdued 56 to blinding music, the deliberate strings.
