1 This is the life of a Congressman. 2 Now 
he is standing on the floor of the House, 3 
the galleries full; raises his voice; presents the bill. 4 
Legislative, the fanfare, greeting its heroes with 5 ringing of 
telephone bells preceding entrances, 6 snapshots (Grenz rays, recording structure) 
newsreels. 7 This is silent, and he proposes: 8 embargo 
on munitions 9 to Germany and Italy 10 as states 
at war with Spain. 11 He proposes 12 Congress memorialize 
13 the governor of California : free Tom Mooney. 14 
A bill for a TVA at Fort Peck Dam. 15 
A bill to prevent industrial silicosis. 16 This is the 
gentleman from Montana. 17 ---I'm a child, I'm leaning from 
a bedroom window, 18 clipping the rose that climbs upon 
the wall, 19 the tea roses, and the red roses, 
20 one for a wound, another for disease, 21 remembrance 
for strikers. I was five, going on six, 22 my 
father on strike at the Anaconda mine; 23 they broke 
the Socialist mayor we had in Butte, 24 the sheriff 
(friendly), found their judge. Strike-broke. 25 Shot father. He died 
: wounds and his disease. 26 My father had silicosis. 
27 Copper contains it, we find it in limestone, 28 
sand quarries, sandstone, potteries, foundries, 29 granite, abrasives, blasting; many 
kinds of grinding, 30 plate, mining, and glass. 31 Widespread 
in trade, widespread in space! 32 Butte, Montana; Joplin, Missouri; 
the New York tunnels, 33 the Catskill Aqueduct. In over 
thirty States. 34 A disease worse than consumption. 35 Only 
eleven States have laws. 36 There are today one million 
potential victims. 37 ,000 Americans have silicosis now. 38 These 
are the proportions of a war. 39 Pictures rise, foreign 
parades, the living faces, 40 Asturian miners with my father's 
face, 41 wounded and fighting, the men at Gauley Bridge, 
42 my father's face enlarged; since now our house 43 
and all our meaning lies in this 44 signature: power 
on a hill 45 centered in its committee and its 
armies 46 sources of anger, the mine of emphasis. 47 
No plane can ever lift us high enough 48 to 
see forgetful countries underneath, 49 but always now the map 
and X-ray seem 50 resemblent pictures of one living breath 
51 one country marked by error 52 and one air. 
53 It sets up a gradual scar formation; 54 this 
increases, blocking all drainage from the lung, 55 eventually scars, 
blocking the blood supply, 56 and then they block the 
air passageways. 57 Shortness of breath, 58 pains around the 
chest, 59 he notices lack of vigor. 60 Bill blocked; 
investigation blocked. 61 These galleries produce their generations. 62 The 
Congressmen are restless, stare at the triple tier, 63 the 
flags, the ranks, the walnut foliage wall; 64 a row 
of empty seats, mask over a dead voice. 65 But 
over the country, a million look from work, 66 five 
hundred thousand stand.
