poster, travel on maps 126 south as the light decays 
vaulting the hills of a world 127 melted silver and 
speed, the water-silver trees 128 until night spends new air, 
the after-life sleep 129 wakes among the spurs and roots 
of mountains 130 the heat escaping, the cypress-licking sky 131 
a country of cave-drawn mutilated hands 132 of water painted 
with the color of light 133 where the world ends 
as the wheels stop turning 134 people begin to live 
by their belief 135 Rites of initiation, if the whirlpool 
eye 136 see fire see buildings deformed and flowing to 
the ground 137 in a derangement of explosion falling 138 
see the distorted face run through an olive grove 139 
the rattle of hens scream of a cliff-face and the 
pylons filing 140 in an icing of sweat enter these 
tropics : war, 141 where initiation is a rite of 
passage, 142 simulation of death or real death, new name, 
143 enjoying for a while the life of the spirits, 
may 144 travel, assume disguises, indeed absorb fear 145 see 
in this end of voyage love like that fabulous bird's 
146 lit breast, the light of the black-crowned night heron 
147 whose static soaring over the central world 148 identifies 
armies, takes the initiate 149 into a room where all 
the chairs fall down 150 and all the walls decay 
and all the world stands bare 151 until the world 
is a field of the Spanish War 152 ships with 
their tall stacks dipping crowd the air 153 seas of 
the sky cruised by anonymous planes 154 subjective myth becomes 
a province, a city 155 whose wish goes to the 
front with its final desire 156 monomanias come their diaries 
their days 157 the burning capitals 158 when the bricks 
of the last street are 159 up in a tall 
wave breaking 160 when cartwheels are targets are words are 
eyes 161 the bullring wheels in flame 162 the circles 
fire at the bleeding trees 163 the world slips under 
the footbeat of the living 164 everybody knows who lost 
the war
