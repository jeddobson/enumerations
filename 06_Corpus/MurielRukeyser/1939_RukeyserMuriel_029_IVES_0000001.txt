1 Knowing the voices of the country, gathering 2 voices 
of other harvests, farm-hands who gather in 3 sources of 
music on the blueberry hills, 4 the village band, lines 
at the schoolhouse singing--- 5 lit cheeks and lips over 
the blown-glass lamps 6 in the broad houses, along the 
pebble beach, 7 or up the baldface mountain's granite sky 
8 above New England, voices of wilderness, 9 scorch of 
the sun where ranges all run west, 10 snow-glare on 
seaward slopes, sea-breeze and tea, 11 the voices of stinted 
music in the towns. 12 There are strange herbs in 
the pasture, and the stiff 13 death angels on the 
red assyrian stones. 14 Daguerreotypes and family quiet, wells, 15 
woodwork and panelling, the cloaks of the forest, 16 all 
the blinds drawn on the imagination's 17 immediate mystery of 
the passer-by. 18 Intense as instruments to split these sounds 
19 into component memory, and reduce 20 memory to uncompromising 
sound. 21 To whom do I speak today? I've heard 
their oarlocks turning 22 at dawn on the river, in 
the warm bankside light 23 heard cut trees fall, hickory 
pull the head 24 toward violent foreground laughter of torn 
wood, 25 watched steeples diminishing in low day before sunset, 
26 and found the evening train riding the bend. 27 
That train will never speak again of tracks 28 routed 
to outland counties, but the firm 29 sumac and corn, 
broadleaf tobacco farms, 30 a churchyard murmur for the air 
of truth, 31 acres where birds I did not know 
till now 32 fly sharp-reflected in water, a field of 
sky; 33 over the human lake, the gods make the 
swallows fly. 34 To whom do I speak today? Call 
off your wit and write 35 for silent implicated men, 
a crabbed line 36 of intercepted music with the world 
between. 37 Networks of songs, white seagull in white air, 
38 cliff edge and stripe of sand's immovable gulls 39 
hung over women's morning festivals. 40 Affection of villages whose 
boy guitarist, 41 blond, with his rolled sleeve and the 
girl behind 42 sings into fire-darkness goodbye after pleasure 43 
and the streets, our liberty, the village store, 44 songs 
of the sorrow and mystery of pavilions' 45 slow carousel-music, 
bulbs and mirrors in sunlight, 46 processions of godly animals 
revolving; 47 or big October mornings, cider and perry noon 
48 when the child comes open-mouth round the corner singing; 
49 that music of the imagination here 50 which is 
the only sound lives after war. 51 Acoustics of sideshows! 
and the organist 52 playing the mirror of the mind 
again. 53 Concord whose choice between repose and truth 54 
colors our memory, whose outer islands of thought 55 are 
fugal movements in one dignity. 56 Rebellion of outposts whose 
deepest results arrive 57 when the rebellion, not from worst 
to greatest, 58 but greater to greater goes. The sequent 
movements 59 of that developing know supernatural 60 Hawthorne as 
dripping wet with guilt, a ghost 61 personal at first, 
and national at twilight, 62 and tries to be universal 
suddenly at midnight; 63 know in their pace the supernatural 
future 64 and the future of human coarseness, and Emerson's 
65 future, eternity, whose forecast is the past, 66 and 
Alcott's suffering, whipping his innocent 67 boy next to the 
guilty, since guilt need not suffer; 68 and Thoreau who 
did not die of his consumption 69 but lived with 
it. 70 Raise us an instrument 71 limitless, without the 
scarecrow keyboard 72 can give repose and fame to successful 
painists 73 playing to camouflage dullness. A scale for truth, 
74 obscurities of a village organist 75 who satisfies his 
life on Sunday. 76 Songs. 77 Young men singing on 
stoops, the sickle pears of Concord, 78 the wheels scraping 
the curb, lockets of childhood 79 faith, barn dances, ballads; 
or those revealing men 80 I gave a mask, and 
they to me the secrets 81 of sensual thought, music 
and thunderbolt. 82 The concentrated man bent over drums, 83 
a skeleton over drums, a fritter of triangles 84 played 
without aim, spasms of arabesques 85 in decoration of nothing. 
I speak a flute over frost, 86 hypnotisms of trumpets, 
the plain and open voice 87 of the walk toward 
the future, commonplace transcendent 88 chores and melodeons, band-concert morning 
89 or the ultimate Negro over his white piano 90 
meaning O Saint! O Blues! 91 This is Charles Ives. 
92 Gold-lettered insurance windows frame his day. 93 He is 
eclectic, he sorts tunes like potatoes 94 for better next-year 
crops, catching the variable 95 wildest improvisations, his clusters of 
meaning; 96 railing against the fake sonorities, "sadness 97 "of 
a bathtub when the water is being let out," 98 
knowing the local hope knocking in any blood. 99 "Today 
we do not choose To die or to dance, 100 
"but to live and walk." 101 Inventor, beginner of strong 
102 coherent substance of music, knowing all 103 apple-reflecting streams, 
loons across echoing lake, 104 cities and men, as liners 
aloof in voyage, 105 and their dead eyes, so much 
blue in the ground 106 as water, as running song 
he loves and pours 107 at water into water, music 
in music. 108 Walks 109 a starfall or under the 
yellow dragons of sunset 110 among the ritual answers and 
the secular wish, 111 among spruce, and maroon of fallen 
needles, walks 112 the pauper light of dawn imagining truth, 
113 turning from recommended madness, from Europe 114 who must 
be forced to eat what she kills, from cities 115 
where all the throats are playing the same tune 116 
mechanically. 117 He was young. He did not climb 118 
four flights on hands and knees to the piano. Heard 
119 the band in the square, Jerusalem the Golden 120 
from all the rooftops, blare of foreground horns, 121 violins 
past the common; in the street 122 the oral dissonance, 
the drum's array. 123 Far breaking music indistinct with wheels' 
124 irregular talk, the moving world, the real 125 personal 
disagreement of many voices; 126 clusters of meaning break in 
fantastic flame, 127 silver of instruments rising behind the eye. 
128 He gathers the known world total into music, 129 
passion of sense, perspective's mask of light 130 into suggestion's 
inarticulate 131 gesture, invention. Knowing the voices, knowing 132 these 
faces and music and this breeding landscape 133 balanced between 
the crisis and the cold 134 which bears the many-born, 
he parcels silence 135 into a music which submerges prayer, 
136 rising as rivers of faces overhead, 137 naming the 
instruments we all must hold.
