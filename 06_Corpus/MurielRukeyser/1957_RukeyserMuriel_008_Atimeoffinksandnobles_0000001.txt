1 A time of finks and nobles, 2 With a 
field office as bond between client and operatives, 3 The 
correspondents and crooked men at work in the plants, 4 
And a force of professional spies sent from place to 
place. 5 The back-room boys are always on hand, for 
shadowing, guard 6 work or the simpler forms : eavesdropping, 
dictaphone work, 7 hanging around. 8 When the strikes come 
the offensive arm, the nobles, 9 Can round up a 
slugging gang from the street-corners 10 And, most efficiently, bring 
in strikebreakers. 11 The national officers handle the big accounts 
: General Motors 12 or Bethlehem Steel.
