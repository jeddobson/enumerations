blue among dark blue, these almost black 3 needles guarded 
the door there was, years 4 before the white guardians 
over Sète 5 ... that's Sea France at the Sea 
Cemetery 6 near Spain where Valéry ... 7 those short 
square Mediterranean 8 man and woman 9 couple at the 
black-cut shadow door 10 within the immense marine 11 glare 
of noon, 12 and on the beach 13 leaning from 
one strong hip 14 a bearded Poseidon 15 looking along 
the surface of the sea 16 father and husband there 
he stands 17 and an invisible woman him beside 18 
blue-eyed blue-haired blue-shadowed 19 under the sun and the moon 
20 they blaze upon us 21 and we waiting waiting 
22 swim to the source 23 very blue evening now 
deepening 24 needles of light ever new 25 a tree 
of light and a tree of darkness 26 blue spruce
