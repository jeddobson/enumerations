1 "Goodbye!" called the stockholders as the ship pulled out 
from 2 the dock, 3 "Good trip, good luck!" as 
the captain saluted; 4 and the crew stared down from 
the top rungs, the passengers 5 stormed confetti 6 from 
all the rails of the luxury liner, crowding 7 in 
imitation of a travel poster. 8 But the last words 
issued from the pier loudspeaker, 9 the admiral-president, shouting, guardian 
and serious, 10 "Orders: above all, not to put in 
at any port 11 doubtful or dangerous." 12 Already, sea 
13 rose livid, boiling over the white expensive hull, 14 
imperious completely, undeniable. 15 Beginning of a voyage, quiet and 
gay; dancing and games, 16 deck lectures, visits to polo 
ponies in the hold, 17 bulletins, engines, radio operator's important 
earphones, 18 poet, barmaid polishing bottles, union man, news, 19 
deck-conversations, visits to the bridge, 20 the sailor wit, music 
and promenade, 21 scrolls watched in the water, the glaze, 
the celadon, 22 high sunrise lustre on the fretted waves. 
23 Persons emerge: 24 gossip the captain walking with the 
blonde, 25 emigrants, pleasure party, financier. 26 The exotic flowers 
were wilting in the staterooms. 27 Log's entry: "Quiet short 
voyage, last night unpleasant 28 weather; 29 passengers sturdy, no 
sea-sickness, but the barmaid 30 fainted before lunch; waiting for 
diagnosis." Captain 31 writing, found confirmation in his heirloom mirror 
32 freckled with tarnish, wishing him well, swaying. "Tomorrow, land." 
33 About the bows, flyingfish, and island in the sea, 
34 dove and appeared, and the chain of foam 35 
followed the boat; 36 a spume of cirrus vanished with 
the sun, 37 safe water entertained a cloudless night. 38 
Fourth day: first sight of rocks, a street of islands, 
39 hazy and permanent, live green, the blues of mist, 
40 bargaining cry of gulls. At the rail, radio operator 
41 scouted for signs of houses. The blonde stood alone. 
The captain 42 hardly looked at the land, a doubtful 
country. 43 "Very welcome," said passengers, watching swimming sea-grasses, 44 
felt trigger joy the ocean should be past, 45 and 
foreign cities, doorless countries come. 46 No landing-place; 47 only 
the rock, moss, mist, a chiffon pageant, 48 suggesting harbors, 
a shore-image. 49 Deep cobalt morning sky, spring's melting ice 
in the sky, 50 softness in air, the port's nearness. 
51 But, the flavor of smoke 52 drifting across the 
bow like the last loudspeaker words; 53 but, the hypnotic 
thunder: cannon in that direction, 54 but, turning the promontory, 
the explosive city. 55 Flares, bombardments! Diamond hallucinations, 56 depth-bombs, 
ocean of waterspouts, fountains with strenuous 57 trunks; 58 city 
of safety. The planted captain, straddled on his deck 59 
thinks, Doubtful, thinks 60 grinning, Dangerous; must head for the 
next port : 61 radio asking advice, amuse all passengers. 
62 Chimes, clocks, rehearsals the radio invents. 63 Stay away 
from here, there are planes falling, 64 airliner crashes over 
Appalachians, 65 two big amphibians lost above the Bay, 66 
no passengers recovered. Rumor: war, 67 passages cancelled, no transatlantic 
sailings. 68 One minute. Flash. One minute. Flash. 69 Explosion! 
70 Death of children, none over thirteen injured, 71 total 
unverified. Flash. Statement, song. 72 Strange clouds visible over the 
prairies, 73 blight on the wheat, dust in the middle 
air, 74 unprecedented weather. To all planes: 75 fly low, 
no flying blind, there will be flares on the ground. 
76 To all ships: make for port. 77 The deckrail 
hangs on the unaltered sea. Leaning, the poet 78 mentions 
danger. The pregnant barmaid half-hears his begging 79 voice. 80 
"Over the pointed hills, over the spit of sand, 81 
harbor, we hurry down. Do you know the familiar 82 
cat of superstition, feline terror?" 83 Sailors' mottoes. The barmaid 
dreads to make the land again, 84 losing her work; 
she watches. Clear sea, definite wave, 85 the picture of 
the last port taken fighting 86 deep on the brain; 
87 "Talk to the union man," she volunteers, 88 "his 
cure is for your trouble." 89 The lighthouse seen at 
the spur, coastal clew, token. 90 But, over the new 
city, black, thunder of smoke, 91 the chilly shoal warm 
at the ship, the charred log rolling, 92 extensive flame, 
cries, broken walls. Laughter of falling glass. 93 Fiery capital, 
and the sea running hot, surf filmed with oil, 94 
burning, the warehouses burning blue, sugar-blue, 95 and shadowless orange 
fire creeping seaward quickly. 96 Cliffs by the town metallic; 
menace of gold reflection, 97 and on their faces 98 
pale of retreat, flattered by fire. The captain 99 orders 
backwater. The child says, "I want to stand on the 
100 ground." 101 But a boat can run down the 
coast, the shore is long, 102 (they said), one city 
stands by itself, unfortunate islands 103 breathe other air. We 
are equipped. We have 104 machines, being extensions of the 
hand and eye, 105 directile and very proud, discovering safety. 
106 With foreign ports at war, foreign prime cities 107 
burned to the ground, still we are navigators. 108 Stars 
come, a rose of stars, perfumed, circle of winds, 109 
black Galileo 110 has taught us mastery. Choose southern voyage, 
111 sun provides gentler beaches, the languid warless lands. 112 
Easy to go south into the warm daybreak, faith in 
the course 113 restored, 114 prepare to land, a captain 
to insure a safe end; 115 they filled the bar, 
stuck labels on their baggage, 116 planned weekends over roadmaps, 
walked the deck, 117 nodded, handled field-glasses, spied on the 
pasture water, 118 and the ship's new position was advanced 
in ink, 119 admired for accuracy, predicted by science, 120 
the map consulted in nervous argument. 121 Only, the weakness; 
122 only, the night sent rocking into 123 the floating 
ocean and the storm's renown. 124 When the light changed 
at last, the wake ran concentrated silver 125 and the 
blue northern sea dissolved to green, brightened, 126 the union
