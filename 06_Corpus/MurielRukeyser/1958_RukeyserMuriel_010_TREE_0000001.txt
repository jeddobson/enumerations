1 It seemed at the time like a slow road 
and late afternoon 2 When I walked past a summery 
turning and saw that tree in the sun. 3 That 
was my first sight of it. It stood blasted open, 
4 Its trunk black with tar on its unsealed destruction. 
5 You could see blue through that window, endless sky 
in the 6 wound 7 Bright blue past the shining 
of black harm. And sound 8 Fresh wood supported branches 
like judge's arms, 9 Crutch under branch, crutch where the 
low hand leaned, 10 Strong new wood propping that apple-tree's 
crown. 11 And the crown? World-full, beneficent, round, 12 Many-branching; 
and red, apple-red, full of juices and color-ripe, 13 The 
great crown spread on the hollow bark and lived. 14 
Lavish and fertile, stood on her death and thrived. 15 
For three years remembering that apple-tree, 16 I saw in 
it the life of life in crisis, 17 Moving over 
its seasons, meeting death with fruition. 18 I have been 
recognizing all I loved. 19 Now, after crisis of day 
and crisis of dream, 20 That tree is burning and 
black before my years. 21 I know it for a 
tree. Rooted and red it bears. 22 Apple and branch 
and seed. 23 Real, and no need to prove, never 
a need 24 For images: of processs, or death, or 
flame; of love, or 25 seeming, or speed.
