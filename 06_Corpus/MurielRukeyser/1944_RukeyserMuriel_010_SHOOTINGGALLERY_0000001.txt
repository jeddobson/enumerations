for Donald B. Elder 1 These images will parade until 
the morning 2 When every symptom is a sign of 
health. 3 Man in repose is armed to kill, his 
sign 4 The bomber diving down the iron funnel--- 5 
Until he is free and the screaming of the boy 
6 Becomes no more than a knitting of the brows. 
7 But now they parade in the city and the 
cloud. 8 Or, Don, your gallery, where all images 9 
Pass as a line of targets and the bells 10 
Ring for perfection and the birds go down, 11 With 
one dark figure always aiming where 12 Any right-minded fool 
sees only air. 13 If anyone call it supernatural, 14 
Say that all shapes seduce : this space is real, 
15 Say that his trigger-finger can contrive 16 The Middle 
West be Spain, the hostile child 17 At last be 
reconciled; until this death 18 Through skill dissolve in the 
body with all myth. 19 Monsters of understanding will deny 
20 The body holds all images, but myth 21 Is 
in this shape, shape of a target space 22 That 
can be filled by the flicker of a face 23 
Until the parade dissolve to peace, the eye 24 Of 
the sacred hunter assume his own identity.
