1 Camera at the crossing sees the city 2 a 
street of wooden walls and empty windows, 3 the doors 
shut handless in the empty street, 4 and the deserted 
Negro standing on the corner. 5 The little boy runs 
with his dog 6 up the street to the bridge 
over the river where 7 nine men are mending road 
for the government. 8 He blurs the camera-glass fixed on 
the street. 9 Railway tracks here and many panes of 
glass 10 tin under light, the grey shine of towns 
and forests: 11 in the commercial hotel (Switzerland of America) 
12 the owner is keeping his books behind the public 
glass. 13 Postoffice window, a hive of private boxes, 14 
the hand of the man who withdraws, the woman who 
reaches 15 her hand 16 and the tall coughing man 
stamping an envelope. 17 The bus station and the great 
pale buses stopping for food; 18 April-glass-tinted, the yellow-aproned waitress; 
19 coast-to-coast schedule on the plateglass window. 20 The man 
on the street and the camera eye: 21 he leaves 
the doctor's office, slammed door, doom, 22 any town this 
one-street town. 23 Glass, wood, and naked eye: the movie-house 
24 closed for the afternoon frames posters streaked with rain, 
25 advertise "Racing Luck" and "Hitch-Hike Lady." 26 Whistling, the 
train comes from a long way away, 27 slow, and 
the Negro watches it grow in the grey air, 28 
the hotel man makes a note behind his potted palm. 
29 Eyes of the tourist house, red-and-white filling station, 30 
the eyes of the Negro, looking down the track, 31 
hotel-man and hotel, cafeteria, camera. 32 And in the beerplace 
on the other sidewalk 33 always one's harsh night eyes 
over the beerglass 34 follow the waitress and the yellow 
apron. 35 The road flows over the bridge, 36 Gamoca 
pointer at the underpass, 37 opposite, Alloy, after a block 
of town. 38 What do you want---a cliff over a 
city? 39 A foreland, sloped to sea and overgrown with 
roses? 40 These people live here.
