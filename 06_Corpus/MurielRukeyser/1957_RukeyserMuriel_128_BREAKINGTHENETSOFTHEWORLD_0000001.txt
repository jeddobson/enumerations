1 Breaking the nets of the world, in glimpses going 
2 Among the mountains of light and the mountains of 
darkness. 3 All of his gateways were the opposites. 4 
If you should mourn him now, you will know whom 
you 5 mourn. 6 Whenever you hate him, and he 
must be hated, 7 You will know what you hate. 
Whatever in him you love 8 You will see in 
yourself who are your brother. 9 All the legends are 
for him and against him. 10 When he saw his 
life false, founded on oppositions, 11 In the face of 
love, in the masks of judges; 12 When he knew 
he was strong and heard every summoning; 13 When he 
fought, when he drank, when he walked into the 14 
world; 15 When he forgot the moment of revelation. 16 
His monsters, his valleys, his waves, his rains of paper, 
17 All spoke to him, and all the masks of 
power. 18 Wounded he lay. And for good reason. 19 
His wounds our wounds. His masks our milestones. 20 The 
guardians of recovery be our guardians, 21 Exultations of towers 
sting our healing; 22 ---The leap that fulfills him, the 
laugh and the forgetting, 23 Are all your dreams, are 
all your dreams. 24 The nets of sleep are broken. 
The four colors of daybreak 25 Shine clear where the 
wish stands, having body and knowing 26 These rooted forests 
are familiar country. 27 The nets of the opposites and 
the nets of refusal 28 Swing at the pliant windows 
of our birth. 29 Nets of his emerging all can 
see. 30 Fire of making streaming over the lives 31 
Of our fathers' youth gave him, gave us our fire. 
32 Stony constraints, the lips of a judge denying 33 
Found weakness everywhere wishing to be Holdfast, 34 Repeating rejections 
and a mimic doom. 35 The rivers of all grace 
streamed through his years, 36 Even among the iron islands, 
chance; 37 And in the acting-out, the rivers are changing: 
38 They are a net of snare or a living 
tree. 39 For in the breaking of things, continual choice 
40 Is the glimpse of birth, given him, given all 
of us 41 Who know in ourselves his fullness and 
refusals. 42 Now light says Amen to shadows and takes 
all things 43 Into another morning where the moment 44 
Offers necessity at last its flower, 45 Offers the meanings 
which are the clues of form. 46 The man who 
fought off human meanings finds 47 All avenues full, a 
procession of images 48 Confronting him with the chain of 
his lifetime dreams. 49 For all things grow, remade as 
rivers that time 50 Turns to resolve hostilities of power.
