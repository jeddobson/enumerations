1 ---You like the State of West Virginia very much, 
do you not? 2 ---I do very much, in the 
summertime. 3 ---How much time have you spent in West 
Virginia? 4 ---During the summer of 1934, when I was 
doing social work 5 down there, I first heard of 
what we were pleased to call 6 the Gauley tunnel 
tragedy, which involved about 2,000 7 men. 8 ---What was 
their salary? 9 ---It started at 40¢ and dropped to 
25¢ an hour. 10 ---You have met these people personally? 
11 ---I have talked to people; yes. 12 According to 
estimates of contractors 13 2,000 men were 14 employed there 
15 period, about 2 years 16 drilling, 3.75 miles of 
tunnel. 17 To divert water (from New River) 18 to 
a hydroelectric plant (at Gauley Junction). 19 The rock through 
which they were boring was of a high 20 silica 
content. 21 In tunnel No. 1 it ran 97-99% pure 
silica. 22 The contractors 23 knowing pure silica 24 30 
years' experience 25 must have known danger for every man 
26 neglected to provide the workmen with any safety device 
. . . . 27 ---As a matter of fact, 
they originally intended to dig that 28 tunnel a certain 
size? 29 ---Yes. 30 ---And then enlarged the size of 
the tunnel, due to the fact 31 that they discovered 
silica and wanted to get it out? 32 ---That is 
true for tunnel No. 1. 33 The tunnel is part 
of a huge water-power project 34 begun, latter part of 
1929 35 direction: New Kanawha Power Co. 36 subsidiary of 
Union Carbide & Carbon Co. 37 That company---licensed : 38 
to develop power for public sale. 39 Ostensibly it was 
to do that; but 40 (in reality) it was formed 
to sell all the power to 41 the Electro-Metallurgical Co. 
42 subsidiary of Union Carbide & Carbon Co. 43 which 
by an act of the State legislature 44 was allowed 
to buy up 45 New Kanawha Power Co. in 1933. 
46 ---They were developing the power. What I am trying 
to 47 get at, Miss Allen, is, did they use 
this silica from the 48 tunnel; did they afterward sell 
it and use it in com- 49 merce? 50 ---They 
used it in the electro-processing of steel. 51 SiO 2 
SiO 2 52 The richest deposit. 53 Shipped on the 
C & O down to Alloy. 54 It was so 
pure that 55 SiO 2 56 they used it without 
refining. 57 ---Where did you stay? 58 ---I stayed at 
Cedar Grove. Some days I would have to hitch 59 
into Charleston, other days to Gauley Bridge. 60 ---You found 
the people of West Virginia very happy to pick 61 
you up on the highway, did you not? 62 ---Yes; 
they are delightfully obliging. 63 (All were bewildered. Again at 
Vanetta they are asking, 64 "What can be done about 
this?") 65 I feel that this investigation may help in 
some manner. 66 I do hope it may. 67 I 
am now making a very general statement as a beginning. 
68 There are many points that I should like to 
develop 69 later, but I shall try to give you 
a general history of 70 this condition first . .
