1 I Muriel stood at the altar-table 2 The young 
man Don Baty stood with us 3 I Muriel fell 
away in me 4 in dread but in a welcoming 
5 I am Don Baty then I said 6 before 
the blue-coated police 7 ever entered and took him. 8 
I am Don Baty, say we all 9 we eat 
our bread, we drink our wine. 10 Our heritance has 
come, we know, 11 your arrest is mine. Yes. 12 
Beethoven saying Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen 13 and all 
a singing, earth and eyes, 14 strong and weaponless. 15 
There is a pounding at the door; 16 now we 
bring our lives entire. 17 I am Don Baty. My 
dear, my dear, 18 in a kind of welcoming, 19 
here we meet, here we bring 20 ourselves. They pound 
on the wall of time. 21 The newborn are with 
us singing.
