1 Under the tall black sky you look out of 
your body 2 lit by a white flare of the 
time between us 3 your body with its touch its 
weight smelling of new wood 4 as on the day 
the news of battle reached us 5 falls beside the 
endless river 6 flowing to the endless sea 7 whose 
waves come to this shore a world away. 8 Your 
body of new wood your eyes alive barkbrown of 9 
treetrunks 10 the leaves and flowers of trees stars all 
caught in crowns of 11 trees 12 your life gone 
down, broken into endless earth 13 no longer a world 
away but under my feet and everywhere 14 I look 
down at the one earth under me, 15 through to 
you and all the fallen 16 the broken and their 
children born and unborn 17 of the endless war.
