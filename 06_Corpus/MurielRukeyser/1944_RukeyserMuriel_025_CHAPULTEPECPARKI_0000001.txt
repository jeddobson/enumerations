1 The calling and the melody all night long 2 
And then in the first stillness, morning 3 Leaning over 
the dark, over the night-park 4 Combing her blue hair. 
5 After the guitars, after the tide of bells, 6 
Surge, calls, and furious song, 7 Very softly the trees 
emerge, 8 A tree of light beside a tree of 
darkness. 9 And in the silent park 10 A girl 
opens her eyes and combs her hair. 11 Freshness of 
blue wavers among the lakes; 12 Two people wake, look 
at the calm forest, 13 Turn an iron wheelbarrow on 
its back 14 And, fanning a little fire under it, 
15 Cook their tortillas. 16 Morning leans down; morning lifts 
out of the stone 17 The angry archaic statue of 
a god 18 Watching from live rock. 19 The Palace 
whitens, and all the standing fountains. 20 Snow is shining 
on the far volcanoes, 21 We walk smiling down the 
Philosopher's Footpath. 22 A young horse runs into the sunlight.
