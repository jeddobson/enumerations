1 He is breaking the nets in his wildness for 
the real. 2 Rivers, and wrestlings, the theater of time 
3 Disclose his need to grow, which is the bond 
of man. 4 The holy linkings acknowledged and the search 
5 Seen with its meanings, and the love of man 
6 Seen with the meanings of the lives we praise. 
7 Identified with our flesh, the living flower 8 Of 
consciousness, the soul which is the form, 9 Giving the 
human power. 10 Most human power of the bonds of 
man! 11 All things are taken in the net of 
meaning, 12 Assuming form. The form is the light of 
day, 13 The net, the need, changing desire, the morning 
14 Of man in our full value whose name is 
peace. 15 Peace is the growing form and the cry 
of Holy 16 In the city of the world, in 
the eyes of children. 17 The light on the rivers 
and on the poor is peace, 18 Light that by 
being requires, from all who see, 19 Beauty and change 
and life. The life of peace, 20 Peace the necessity 
of growth, clue of our ways. 21 Music of growth, 
the world's magnificence, 22 Is born, the break of day, 
child of the world. 23 Now in the net of 
forces 24 The stars of these migrations being our days 
25 Do take their changes, another constellation. 26 Although today 
their broken-crested light 27 Shines on our blackened poverty of 
wars. 28 There is the seed of the gift diversity 
29 Declaring the pride of man, allowing lightnings kneel 30 
On the horizon of difference, shocking the blaze awake. 31 
The central mysteries and dance of initiation, 32 The language 
and links of making, and the process 33 We bless 
that discovers self and the self of the world 34 
In one law moving and given : the form of 
the love of 35 growth. 36 By that light, by 
that infinite rich darkness 37 Many shinings of truth making 
aware, 38 A flare against corruption and forgetting, 39 Declare 
and create that the human light of meanings 40 Let 
us give us ourselves 41 Linked, given, and in glimpses 
going.
