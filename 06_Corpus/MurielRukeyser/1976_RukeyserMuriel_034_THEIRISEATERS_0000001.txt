for John Cage 1 It was like everything else, like 
everything--- 2 nothing at all like what they say it 
is. 3 The petals of iris were slightly cinnamon, 4 
a smooth beard in the mouth 5 transforming to strong 
drink, 6 light violet turning purple in the throat 7 
and flashed and went deep red 8 burning and burning. 
9 Well, no, more an extreme warmth, 10 but we 
thought of burning, 11 we thought of poisons, 12 we 
thought of the closing of the throat 13 forever, of 
dying, of the end of song. 14 We were doing 
it, you understand, 15 for the first time. 16 You 
were the only one of us who knew 17 and 
you saved us, John, 18 with music, with a 19 
complex 20 smile.
