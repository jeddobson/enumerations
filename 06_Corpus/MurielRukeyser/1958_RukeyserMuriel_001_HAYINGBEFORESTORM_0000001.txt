1 This sky is unmistakable. Not lurid, not low, not 
black. 2 Illuminated and bruise-color, limitless, to the noon 3 
Full of its floods to come. Under it, field, wheels, 
and 4 mountain, 5 The valley scattered with friends, gathering 
in 6 Live-colored harvest, filling their arms; not seeming to 
hope 7 Not seeming to dread, doing. 8 I stand 
where I can see 9 Holding a small pitcher, coming 
in toward 10 The doers and the day. 11 These 
images are all 12 Themselves emerging : they face their 
moment, love or go 13 down, 14 A blade of 
the strong hay stands like light before me. 15 The 
sky is a torment on our eyes, the sky 16 
Will not wait for this golden, it will not wait 
for form. 17 There is hardly a moment to stand 
before the storm. 18 There is hardly time to lay 
hand to the great earth. 19 Or time to tell 
again what power shines past storm.
