1 PAUL: You can't come with us. 2 We have 
business to do. 3 We have to go over to 
Germany 4 But we'll be back in a minute. 5 
We have to go to Hitler's land 6 To shoot 
him. 7 But you are a lady so you can 
stay home. 8 Men take care of ladies. 9 MISS 
LORENCE: Who are you going to shoot? 10 PAUL: Hitler 
of course, the bad wolf. 11 If you are in 
trouble with Hitler you'd better 12 not come on the 
ferryboat. 13 If you are don't come here with us, 
14 You'll make more trouble than we have. 15 Are 
you a Jew? 16 It's being Jews that makes the 
trouble. 17 It makes people worry. 18 Are you Jew? 
19 MISS LORENCE: No. 20 PAUL: That is why you 
are not worried. That is 21 why you are happy.
