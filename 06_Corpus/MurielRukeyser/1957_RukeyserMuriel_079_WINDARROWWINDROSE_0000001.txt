1 Wind arrow, wind rose, the wind currents in air, 
2 A spiral staircase down the height of sky. 3 
Chart of the urgencies of sail. 4 Shrouds tight, salted 
and glittering, 5 And the glittering lips of fifty-six sailors 
6 All asleep four hundred years of water 7 Among 
the cycles of drift. Forgetfulness.
