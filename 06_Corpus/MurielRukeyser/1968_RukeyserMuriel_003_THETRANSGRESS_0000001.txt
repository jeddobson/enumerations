1 That summer midnight under her aurora 2 northern and 
still we passed the barrier. 3 Two make a curse, 
one giving, one accepting. 4 It takes two to break 
a curse 5 transformed at last in each other's eyes. 
6 I sat on the naked bed of space, 7 
all things becoming other than what they seem 8 in 
the night-waking, in the revelation 9 thundering on tabu after 
the broken 10 imperative, while the grotesque ancestors fade 11 
with you breathing beside me through our dream: 12 bed 
of forbidden things finally known--- 13 art from the symbol 
struck, living and made. 14 Branch lifted green from the 
dead shock of stone.
