1 is my concern. That's this moment, 2 when I 
lean on my elbows out the windowsill 3 and feel 
the city among its time-zones, among its seas, 4 among 
its late night news, the pouring in 5 of everything 
meeting, wars, dreams, winter night. 6 Light in snowdrifts causing 
the young girls 7 lying awake to fall in love 
tonight 8 alone in bed; or the little children 9 
half world over tonight rained on by fire---that's us--- 10 
calling on somebody---that's us---to come 11 and help them. 12 
Now I see at the boundary of darkness 13 extreme 
of moonlight. 14 Alone. All my hopes 15 scattered in 
people quarter world away 16 half world away, out of 
all hearing. 17 Tell myself: 18 Trust in experience. And 
in the rhythms. 19 The deep rhythms of your experience.
