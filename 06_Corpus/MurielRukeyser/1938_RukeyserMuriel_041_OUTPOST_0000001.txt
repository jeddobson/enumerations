1 After the last cold mountain 2 turns loaded with 
rock, the green iceberg 3 wheels at the ship 4 
and gulls pass screaming : 5 sail out on trembling 
decks that cut 6 deepdigging into the ring of sea 
: 7 End of America! not so far out 8 
as the home-storm of sickness, 9 furious seas, not like 
the arranged waves here 10 foreign in green, austere, 11 
but, bright as household scene, 12 all the equipment of 
dismay, 13 teaching grave civilized man 14 nothing, feeding his 
sickest 15 dread of strong icy seas, 16 disgust with 
sunlight. 17 After the mountains turn, the Floating Man 18 
raises his head (his shoulders are cold rock), 19 his 
face takes on the home-look : suffering, 20 sinking beneath 
the last iceberg horizon, 21 reminding us, risen to find 
us this last time. 22 He carries in his eyes 
street-images, 23 on forehead, protest, on sinking face, goodbye, 24 
the sombre, bright, the unpredictable wind 25 laying a flag 
across his lips. 26 End of America! the ocean opening, 
27 lighthouse and iceberg, vestige of vegetable green, 28 the 
sad face everywhere sinking backward last : 29 not rock, 
not ice, but here most civilized man, 30 outpost survivor, 
31 the last and floating trace, streaming down every river 
32 into the sea whose foreign colors waver, 33 hold 
to the end the images of violence 34 on rising 
overwave and underwave, 35 slave and slavedriver.
