1 Held between wars 2 my lifetime 3 among wars, 
the big hands of the world of death 4 my 
lifetime 5 listens to yours. 6 The faces of the 
sufferers 7 in the street, in dailiness, 8 their lives 
showing 9 through their bodies 10 a look as of 
music 11 the revolutionary look 12 that says I am 
in the world 13 to change the world 14 my 
lifetime 15 is to love to endure to suffer the 
music 16 to set its portrait 17 up as a 
sheet of the world 18 the most moving the most 
alive 19 Easter and bone 20 and Faust walking among 
flowers of the world 21 and the child alive within 
the living woman, music of man, 22 and death holding 
my lifetime between great hands 23 the hands of enduring 
life 24 that suffers the gifts and madness of full 
life, on earth, in our 25 time, 26 and through 
my life, through my eyes, through my arms and 27 
hands 28 may give the face of this music in 
portrait waiting for 29 the unknown person 30 held in 
the two hands, you.
