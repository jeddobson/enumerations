1 But in these years, what is free, what is 
strong? 2 People, strength. He had heard this always, 3 
The mud of our towns turning into stone cities, 4 
The fire of our wealth, space of our own time 
5 Flowing beyond our eyes. Now he can see the 
older 6 Faces rising : authors of our belief, image-faces 
of active 7 Sources like lines his father called in 
the morning, 8 The music of difference, all alive. 9 
The founders of law and this people, who set in 
diversity 10 The base of our living. 11 Actual diversity 
of days and sources, smiling in disagreement, 12 strengthened by 
one another, 13 Until the idea of diversity becomes our 
strength, sacred to us. 14 The range broadening, the potential 
becoming a way and a song. 15 Many have fought 
this reality. We know the wounds, 16 On the body 
of work and of heroes, and in all of us. 
Wounds 17 of our green belief; 18 Many have seen 
in the growing of their lives that dwarfing 19 wound, 
the starving out of their chances by the rigid, 20 
who have no hope but the static, the dead fact 
and size, 21 Not the strength that we laugh in 
beginning, the pleasure moving 22 toward unknown making; but hard 
control, clanging of doors 23 closing like burial, the signals 
of wreck--- 24 Deforming the children in the galleries of 
coal, deforming the 25 woman in her pride of home, 
deforming us in our dream and 26 in bed and 
as we look in one another's faces, 27 Seeing the 
terrible still poem. 28 Into this time 29 Vision sails. 
In the midland, thinking of ocean, 30 Among constraint, brooding 
on our long hope, 31 That hope in distinctness rides, 
full of our powers. 32 Riding in light 33 Into 
the movement of our bodies, into our words, 34 In 
all we love.
