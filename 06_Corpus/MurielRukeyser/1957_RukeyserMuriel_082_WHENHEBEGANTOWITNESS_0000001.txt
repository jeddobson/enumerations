1 When he began to witness, it was not to 
a journey, 2 Nor the questions, nor the answers, nor 
fiery London. Whole 3 For the first time in imagination, 
man in conflict 4 May tell, as he enters, that 
there is an entrance. 5 Fire never yet felled this 
man's pillar; 6 His bed is at home, where he 
knows it is. 7 Love weaves him in, love guards 
the locks, and love 8 Sends his eyes a bravery 
of language. 9 But the eyes of the man are 
the eyes of witness 10 He will never acknowledge the 
old polarities. 11 Question and answer carry the oppositions, 12 
And success. And defeat. 13 Now no one can declare 
14 With any finality, The Day After The War. 15 
He suddenly says, the open ways are sure, 16 The 
certain relationships are Offer and Give. 17 Even to see 
that fire 18 Allows me to witness. Now I begin 
to name 19 The name of beginning and making, the 
first word.
