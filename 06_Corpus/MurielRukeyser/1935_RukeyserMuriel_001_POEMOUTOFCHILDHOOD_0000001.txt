1 Breathe-in experience, breathe-out poetry : 2 Not Angles, angels 
: and the magnificent past 3 shot deep illuminations into 
high-school. 4 I opened the door into the concert-hall 5 
and a rush of triumphant violins answered me 6 while 
the syphilitic woman turned her mouldered face 7 intruding upon 
Brahms. Suddenly, in an accident 8 the girl's brother was 
killed, but her father had just died : 9 she 
stood against the wall, leaning her cheek, 10 dumbly her 
arms fell, "What will become of me?" and 11 I 
went into the corridor for a drink of water. 12 
These bandages of image wrap my head 13 when I 
put my hand up I hardly feel the wounds. 14 
We sat on the steps of the unrented house 15 
raining blood down on Loeb and Leopold, 16 creating again 
how they removed his glasses 17 and philosophically slit his 
throat. 18 They who manipulated and misused our youth, 19 
smearing those centuries upon our hands, 20 trapping us in 
a welter of dead names, 21 snuffing and shaking heads 
at patent truth.... 22 We were ready to go the 
long descent with Virgil 23 the bough's gold shade advancing 
forever with us, 24 entering the populated cold of drawing-rooms; 
25 Sappho, with her drowned hair trailing along Greek waters, 
26 weed binding it, a fillet of kelp enclosing 27 
the temples' ardent fruit : 28 Not Sappho, Sacco. 29 
Rebellion pioneered among our lives, 30 viewing from far-off many-branching 
deltas, 31 innumerable seas.32 In adolescence I knew travellers 33 
speakers digressing from the ink-pocked rooms, 34 bearing the unequivocal 
sunny word. 35 Prinzip's year bore us : see us 
turning at breast 36 quietly while the air throbs over 
Sarajevo 37 after the mechanic laugh of that bullet. 38 
How could they know what sinister knowledge finds 39 its 
way among our brains' wet palpitance, 40 what words would 
nudge and giggle at our spine, 41 what murders dance? 
42 These horrors have approached the growing child; 43 now 
that the factory is sealed-up brick 44 the kids throw 
stones, smashing the windows, 45 membranes of uselessness in desolation. 
46 We grew older quickly, watching the father shave 47 
and the splatter of lather hardening on the glass, 48 
playing in sandboxes to escape paralysis, 49 being victimized by 
fataller sly things. 50 "Oh, and you," he said, scraping 
his jaw, "what will you be?" 51 "Maybe : something 
: like : Joan : of : Arc...." 52 Allies 
Advance, we see, 53 Six Miles South to Soissons. And 
we beat the drums. 54 Watchsprings snap in the mind, 
uncoil, relax, 55 the leafy years all somber with foreign 
war. 56 How could we know what exposed guts resembled? 
57 A wave, shocked to motion, babbles margins 58 from 
Asia to Far Rockaway spiralling 59 among clocks in its 
four-dimensional circles. 60 Disturbed by war we pedalled bicycles 61 
breakneck down the decline, until the treads 62 conquered our 
speed and pulled our feet behind them, 63 and pulled 
our heads. 64 We never knew the war, standing so 
small 65 looking at eye-level toward the puttees, searching 66 
the picture-books for sceptres, pennants for truth; 67 see Galahad 
unaided by puberty. 68 Ratat a drum upon the armistice, 
69 Kodak As You Go : photo : they danced 
late, 70 and we were a generation of grim children 
71 leaning over the bedroom sills, watching 72 the music 
and the shoulders and how the war was over, 73 
laughing until the blow on the mouth broke night 74 
wide out from cover. 75 The child's curls blow in 
a forgotten wind, 76 immortal ivy trembles on the wall 
: 77 the sun has crystallized these scenes, and tall 
78 shadows remember time cannot rescind.79 Organize the full results 
of that rich past 80 open the windows : potent 
catalyst, 81 harsh theory of knowledge, running down the aisles 
82 crying out in the classrooms, March ravening on the 
plain, 83 inexorable sun and wind and natural thought. 84 
Dialectically our youth unfolds : 85 the pale child walking 
to the river, passional 86 in ignorance in loneliness demanding 
87 its habitation for the leaping dream, kissing 88 quick 
air, the vibrations of transient light, 89 not knowing substance 
or reserve, walking 90 in valvular air, each person in 
the street 91 conceived surrounded by his life and pain, 
92 fixed against time, subtly by these impaled : 93 
death and that shapeless war. Listening at dead doors, 94 
our youth assumes a thousand differing flesh 95 summoning fact 
from abandoned machines of trade, 96 knocking on the wall 
of the nailed-up power-plant, 97 telephoning hello, the deserted factory, 
ready 98 for the affirmative clap of truth 99 ricochetting 
from thought to thought among 100 the childhood, the gestures, 
the rigid travellers.
