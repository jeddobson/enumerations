1 Yes, I have seen their eyes. In peaceful gardens 
2 the dark flowers now are always children's eyes, 3 
full-colored, haunted as evening under fires 4 showered from the 
sky of a burning country. 5 Shallow-featured children under trees 
6 look up among green shadows of the leaves. 7 
The angel, flaming, gives --- into his hands 8 all 
is given and he does not change. 9 The child 
changes and takes. 10 All is given. He makes and 
changes. 11 The angel stands. 12 A flame over the 
tree. Night calling in the cloud. 13 And shadow among 
winds. Where does the darkness lie? 14 It comes out 
of the person, says the child. 15 A shadow tied 
and alive, trying to be. 16 In the tremendous child-world, 
everything is high, 17 active and fiery, sun-cats run through 
the walls, 18 the tree blows overhead like a green 
joy, 19 and cloudy leopards go hunting in the sky. 
20 The shadow in us sings, "Stand out of the 
light!" 21 But I live, I live, I travel in 
the sun. 22 On burning voyages of war they go. 
23 Like starving ghosts they stumble after nuns. 24 Children 
of heroes, Defeat the dark companion. 25 But if they 
are told they are happy, they will know. 26 Who 
kills the father burns up the children's tears. 27 Some 
suffering blazes beyond all human touch, 28 some sounds of 
suffering cry, far out of reach. 29 These children brings 
to us their mother's fears. 30 Singing, "O make us 
strong O let us go---" 31 The new world comes 
among the old one's harms, 32 old world carrying new 
world in her arms. 33 But if you say they 
are free, then they will know. 34 War means to 
me, sings a small skeleton, 35 only the separation, 36 
mother no good and gone, 37 taken away in lines 
of fire and foam. 38 The end of war 39 
will bring me, bring me home. 40 The children of 
the defeated, sparrow-poor and starved, 41 create, create, must make 
their world again. 42 Dead games and false salutes must 
be their grace. 43 One wish must move us, flicker 
from our lives 44 to the marred face. 45 My 
child, my victim, my wish this moment come! 46 But 
the martyr-face cries to us fiercely 47 "I search to 
learn the way out of childhood; 48 I need to 
fight. I wish, I wish for home." 49 This is 
what they say, who were broken off from love: 50 
However long we were loved, it was not long enough. 
51 We were afraid of the broad big policeman, 52 
of lions and tigers, the dark hall and the moon. 
53 After our father went, nothing was ever the same, 
54 when mother did not come back, we made up 
a war game. 55 My cat was sitting in the 
doorway when the planes 56 went over, and my cat 
saw mother cry; 57 furry tears, fire fell, wall went 
down; 58 did my cat see mother die? 59 Mother 
is gone away, my cat sits here coughing. 60 I 
cough and sit. I am nobody's nothing. 61 However long 
they loved us, it was not long enough. 62 For 
we have to be strong, to know what they did, 
and then 63 our people are saved in time, our 
houses built again. 64 You will not know, you have 
a sister and brother; 65 my doll is not my 
child, my doll is my mother. 66 However strong we 
are, it is not strong enough. 67 I want to 
grow up. To come back to love. 68 I see 
it pass before me in parade, 69 my entire life 
as a procession of images. 70 The toy, the golden 
kernel, the glass lamp. 71 The present she gave me, 
the first page I read, 72 the little animal, the 
shadowless tall angel. 73 The angel stands. The child changes 
and takes. 74 He makes a world, stands up among 
the cousins, 75 cries to the family, "Ladies and gentlemen--- 
76 The world is falling down! " After the smooth 
hair 77 darkens, and summer lengthens the smooth cheek, 78 
and the diffuse gestures are no longer weak, 79 he 
begins to be the new one, to have what happened, 
80 to do what must be done. 81 O, when 
the clouds and the blue horse of childhood 82 melt 
away and the golden weapons, 83 and we remember the 
first public day's 84 drums and parades and the first 
angel 85 standing in the garden, his dark lips 86 
and silver blood, how he stood, 87 giving, for all 
he was was given. 88 I begin to have what 
happened to me. 89 O, when the music of carousels 
and stars 90 is known, and the music of the 
scene 91 makes a clear meeting, greeting and claim of 
gods, 92 we see through the hanging curtain of the 
year 93 they change each other with one change of 
love! 94 see, in one breath, in a look! 95 
See, in pure midnight a flare of broken color 96 
clears to a constellation. 97 Peace is asleep, war's lost. 
It is love. 98 I wanted to die. The masked 
and the alone 99 seemed the whole world, and all 
the gods at war, 100 and all the people dead 
and depraved. Today 101 the constellation and the music! Love. 
102 You who seeking yourself arrive at these lines, 103 
look once, and you see the world, 104 look twice 
and you see your self. 105 And all the children 
moving in their change. 106 To have what has happened, 
the pattern and the shock; 107 and all of them 
walk out of their childhood, 108 give to you one 
blue look. 109 And all the children bowing in their 
game, 110 saying Farewell, Goodbye; Goodbye, Farewell.
