1 As I went down the road to the water, 
the river to the sea, 2 the valley narrowed to 
a cat's-eye jewel, 3 one middle streak of highlight straightening; 
4 and nothing was plain in the river-light, 5 not 
even what I was hyrrying for 6 as I walked 
and thought 7 At the waterfront they are free. 8 
As I went down past the low barren orchards hanging 
in the dark 9 (They are free at the waterfront), 
10 I heard the night-bird answer: "The trees suffered too 
much, 11 "now they are sterile; but in your city 
12 "the ghosts of houses struggle to put down roots, 
13 "and in the rooms, they have nightmares of freedom, 
14 "they are jealous of any fruit." 15 As I 
crossed over Gravelly Run, I looked into the water 16 
(They are free at the waterfront), 17 not one cloud 
whitening the brown black water, 18 but there I saw 
my face so bare 19 not blemished but unlit, 20 
I thought, if I am not almost free 21 there's 
an end of wit. 22 As I came toward the 
sea, I saw the marks of night 23 walk on 
and over the sky and night went over 24 without 
a sound on the wide water 25 but the sea's 
sound and the windspin 26 talking to ships slave under 
the sea 27 and on the sea obsessed with tide 
28 as the long tides came in.
