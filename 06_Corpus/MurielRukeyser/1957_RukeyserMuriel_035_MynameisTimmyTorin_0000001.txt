1 PAUL: My name is Timmy Torin. 2 I can 
do more things when I'm bigger. 3 You like me 
big don't you? 4 If somebody was lost I could 
find them 5 Any time my mommy tells me or 
you tell me. 6 I'm a very big boy. 7 
I'm not afraid. 8 You know about Jesus, little Lorence? 
9 Some day I will tell you all about Jesus. 
10 My father is dead, he is an angel. 11 
When you are blind you cannot see but black. 12 
When you are blind, it is like you are nothing 
13 And are dead. How is that? 14 Somebody says, 
When you are dead you are 15 stopped. 16 And 
other people say 17 You go to the sky and 
watch and sing. 18 Miss Lorence, I am tired. 19 
You can have one of my blocks.
