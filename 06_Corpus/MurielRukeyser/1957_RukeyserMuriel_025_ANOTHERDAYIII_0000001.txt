1 PAUL: I will now sing a song for you, 
Miss Lorence. 2 Will you write it down? 3 MISS 
LORENCE: Yes. I'd like to. 4 PAUL: No. I cannot 
sing today. My songs are tired. 5 They are unhappy. 
6 MISS LORENCE: I can write down your unhappy song. 
7 PAUL: No. You sing me a song. 8 MISS 
LORENCE: ShaIl I sing Sacramento? Buckeye Jim? 9 PAUL: No, 
no. You must not sing those songs. 10 Sing your 
new song. About me. 11 Sing about that grownup downstairs 
12 Who lives in a tree. 13 MISS LORENCE: Who 
lives in a tree? 14 PAUL: The man with the 
grass in his lovely hair. 15 The wild, happy man, 
with the bears, 16 and the large scamper. 17 MISS 
LORENCE: The words are masks, the words are a stream; 
18 they mask his open fears. The apprehensions 19 stand 
there. 20 PAUL: I don't want to rest. Once upon 
a time there 21 was a Miss Lorence, who was 
going away, 22 away, away, away. Don't go away to 
leave 23 me. Sit on my bed not to leave 
me. A 24 skylark am I, wildly I walk, walk, 
walk, 25 walk. 26 Mittens here in my bed. 27 
There. I hit you, but I love you. 28 When 
you die you stop. Don't really worry, 29 dear you. 
30 I do not really die. Do not believe anything 
I 31 tell you, 32 Or unless you really see. 
33 Sometimes I joke. 34 This is school. Not sky, 
not home, but 35 school, school, school. 36 What is 
my shadow? It is me, 37 But not a mirror.
