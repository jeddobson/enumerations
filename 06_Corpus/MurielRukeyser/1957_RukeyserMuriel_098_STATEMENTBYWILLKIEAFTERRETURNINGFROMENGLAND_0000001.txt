1 It is not only the present that is at 
stake. 2 Somewhere in this confusing world we must find---we 
must 3 build---a future for ourselves. 4 We must now 
have courage, bravely to do the things that we 5 
know ought to be done. 6 And we must lay 
the foundations for the world of the children. 7 That 
world cannot be a closed system. 8 It must be 
an open system. 9 It must be a world in 
which we share the responsibilities. They 10 are many, but 
they lead to the great prospect---of peace.
