1 some flushed-earth-color pueblo 2 holding the long-light sunset 3 
shadows go into this ground 4 the mountain lifting the 
lake 5 in an orante gesture 6 like the men 
7 in their white shirt-sleeves 8 in the basement of 
the Planetarium 9 the mailman the policeman the highschool-teacher 10 
these winter evenings making their own telescopes 11 they hold 
them up to test them the only way 12 against 
a ray of light in a gesture of offering. 13 
This long wide gorge and mesa make the gesture 14 
holding each man up against sunset light 15 and holding 
Blue Lake up.
