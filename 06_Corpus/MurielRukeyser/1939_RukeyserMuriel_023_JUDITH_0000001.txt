1 This is a dark woman at a telephone 2 
thinking 'brown blood, brown blood' and calling 3 numbers, saying 
to her friend, "I will be gone 4 "a month 
or two," breaking a weekend saying 5 "I will be 
back in a week," in an undertone 6 to her 
doctor, "I will take care of the child, 7 "I 
may be back within the year," thinking alone 8 'brown 
blood' and staring hard at the furniture 9 remembering the 
nightmares of a room 10 she leaves, forever clamped at 
her breastbone. 11 This is a woman recalling waters of 
Babylon, 12 seeing all charted life as a homicide map 
13 flooded up to the X which marks her life's 
14 threatened last waterline. Safety now for her husband, 15 
no taint---brown blood for him, the naked blond, 16 the 
tall and safe. For her, the bottomless ship 17 inviting 
to voyage---the sly advertisement, 18 as the enemy in war 
invites to luxury: 19 "Our side has its meat, wine, 
and cigarettes." 20 Prediction of no safety for the bone. 
21 This is a woman putting away close pain, 22 
child of a stolid mother whose family runs wild, 23 
abandons fear, abandons legend; while the insane 24 French peasant 
is caught, stalking and barking Heil, 25 fire, anemia, famine, 
the long smoky madness 26 a broken century cannot reconcile. 
27 Agons of blood, brown blood, and a dark woman 
28 leaves the blond country with a backward look, 29 
adventures into the royal furious dark 30 already spread from 
Kishinev to York. 31 At the green sources of the 
Amazon 32 a bird develops, who repeats his race 33 
whole in a lifetime; hatched with primitive claws 34 he 
grows and can absorb them and is grown 35 to 
a green prime of feathers. This is known. 36 A 
woman sitting at a telephone 37 repeats her race, hopes 
for the trap's defence. 38 Defenders rumored nothing but skeleton. 
39 Applause of news. Suicides reaching for 40 ritual certainty 
in their last impatience. 41 These dragon-surrounded young cannot obtain, 
42 and the white children who become unreal, 43 live 
responsive as smoke and travel alone, 44 wish revocation of 
fugitives and banned, 45 know sun-roar, fatal telephones, the hand 
46 palm placing out, the fact wanting its rant. 47 
Cry to the newborn, the youngest in the world 48 
for a new twisting wind to be all winds 49 
to cancel this, rejuvenating rain 50 to wash it away, 
forces to fight it down. 51 A dark-faced woman at 
a telephone 52 answered by silence and cruelest dragon-silence; 53 
she knows the weakness of the dim and alone, 54 
compunctive bitter essence of the wound, 55 the world-spike that 
is driven through all our hearts. 56 She will go 
like a woman sweated from a stone 57 out from 
these boundaries, while a running cloud 58 in that bruised 
night no bigger than a brain 59 joins in a 
cloud-race over the flat of sky 60 in persecution of 
the whitened moon.
