1 Wildflowers withering with the same death. 2 Grave a 
slope, threw she long shadows, 3 Mountains o'erlooking earth, affect 
and places 4 High. On God that time, the elder 
worshipper, 5 Deemed spirit, made here a tribe of offering, 
6 Bear and wolf of skins shaggy, maze of ears 
7 And garlands lay. Mother, my dreams, night and 8 
Mockings like friends, pastimes hate I 9 And business accursed 
upon me glares; 10 The life of the sick is 
sorrow, guilt, and love. 11 Eye her then, vain in 
might, simple as heart. 12 Heaven props earth with columns; 
mountains raise 13 Distances, blue in hills, upward swell fields. 
14 Man has ages for soil, mining himself 15 To 
paradise. The scene murmurs. Struggle with winds, 16 Hear depth 
dizzy the ear, a thunderbolt of whiteness. 17 Centuries of 
growth, darkness of capitals, 18 Pinnacles and trees shaggy and 
wild. 19 North to the drowned! and nations separate the 
world. 20 Shriek eagle in your torrent solitude. 21 Glens 
of secret, down into forest-tops, 22 Beneath a wide-spread earth; 
majesty and beauty 23 Fail. Foot mountains. Though rocky our 
ascent, 24 Face nature in harmony, lovely, and face it! 
wild. 1
