1 Nevertheless the moon 2 Heightens the secret 3 Sleep 
long withheld 4 Dry for a rain of dreams--- 5 
Flies straight above me 6 White, hot-hearted, 7 Among the 
streaming 8 Firmament armies. 9 A monk of flames 10 
Stands shaking in my heart 11 Where sleep might lie. 
12 Where you all night have lain. 13 And now 
hang dreaming, 14 Faded acute, fade full, 15 Calling your 
cloudy fame, 16 A keen high nightlong cry. 17 Rises 
my silent, turning 18 Heart. Heart where my love 19 
Might lie, try toward my love 20 Flying, let go 
all need, 21 Brighten and burn--- 22 Rain down, raging 
for life 23 Light my love's dream tonight.
