1 Poem white page white page poem 2 something is 
streaming out of a body in waves 3 something is 
beginning from the fingertips 4 they are starting to declare 
for my whole life 5 all the despair and the 
making music 6 something like wave after wave 7 that 
breaks on a beach 8 something like bringing the entire 
life 9 to this moment 10 the small waves bringing 
themselves to white paper 11 something like light stands up 
and is alive
