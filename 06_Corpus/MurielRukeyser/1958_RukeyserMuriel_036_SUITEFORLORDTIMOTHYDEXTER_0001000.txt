his word, 52 This country's bond's as sound as me, 
53 Timothy. 54 What 'dyou say? 55 'Sound as I'---? 
56 Very well; me is I, 57 I the tree 
58 Flourishing." 59 Mr. Hamilton truly meant 60 An almost 
infinite per cent 61 Would accrue 62 Quickly to 63 
The trustful and the nourishing. 64 The newborn Federal bank 
has stirred. 2 65 Timothy is a sword. 66 A 
sword without blessing, 67 A sword without fame, 68 A 
sword bearing no signal name. 69 If Newburyport 70 Will 
be blind, 71 Will seem bored, 72 Never mind. 73 
New Hampshire's kind, and 74 Calls him "Lord." 3 75 
Apprentice then, on the road 76 Next day wore his 
freedom suit, 77 Brided widow and won his house, 78 
Ground their proverbs underfoot. 79 A poor boy made and 
found 80 And funding came to his own tune. 81 
"Lord" is the center of that sound, 82 And all 
the songs proclaim 83 He is the bright blue morning 
rhyme, 84 A great name rides before his name. 85 
Turn, burn, and overturn! 86 Among the squarest houses, he 
87 Is more than Timothy, 88 And more than merry. 
89 Can forever now retort 90 Very much Newbury- 91 
Port: 92 The voice of the people and I can't 
help it, 93 But all's easy and no bones broken, 
94 All is well, all in Love. 95 The first 
Lord of the age has spoken. 96 Now all the 
torment Massachusetts bore 97 Triumphs in a blaze of love. 
98 Love, love, fantasy, 99 For 100 Out of shame 
and poverty, 101 From oppression, commerce, war, 102 Rose a 
new sovereignty: 103 The states are free and trade is 
free 104 And Dexter's Lord Timothy.105 Sharp clouds and a 
sea-moon sang to me 106 Where were you born my 
young my dear 107 I said nowhere vary your singing 
4 108 Now where was your mother shaded, they 109 
sang, 110 Nowhere I answered the ring the rung 111 
Dark bells rang and I was young--- 112 O on 
the water then, wine on the sea--- 113 Nowhere they 
cried and they sang to me--- 114 Nowhere my dear 
my darling, 115 My dearly darling beware. 116 Where and 
nowhere and then the singing changed 117 Past hills of 
prophecy the words went ranging, 118 The colors of the 
words to images 119 Went formed. And all I saw 
was warming-pans, 120 Three nights of warming-pans until I woke 
5 121 And a great ship's bare spars sailing my 
122 window, 123 Up to my tall room window a 
ship's spars, 124 And I remembered all the nights and 
wars, 125 Sang in my waking of poverty and dream: 
126 My dearly darling beware. 127 The sun all male 
and female through me poured, 128 Awake I bought a 
cargo all of dream, 6 129 Warming-pans for the South, 
to all the 130 roaring 131 Nothing, to those who 
mock at my song. 132 I have entrusted south my 
folly cargo, 133 A full hold coming home now showers 
gold. 134 My warming-pans sailed gently to Jamaica--- 135 The 
lids ripped off, made fine molasses-ladles, 136 Rum, rum, my 
darling beware. 137 Gold I am, lord of the cats 
of gold, 7 138 Mittens and kittens and coals of 
gold, 139 Malta, the Baltic, the Caribbee, 140 And Britain 
commend their money to me 141 As I go funding 
among the dreamers, 142 Among their golden nightmares ringing 143 
Among their proverbs a wine-gold bell, 144 Sounding a folly 
my dear my darling 145 My dearly darling dream well.105

can I know, 147 What can I show so that 
we see ourselves? 148 Voices of stinted singing in the 
towns, 149 Voices of wildness and fear of wilderness. 150 
The rhythm, the root. Gathering in 151 Sources of music 
and the wild sea-rose. 152 Sea-music and the sea building 
its waters, 153 The weathervane beast. My song. 154 Whenever 
I say what I mean 155 They mock and call
