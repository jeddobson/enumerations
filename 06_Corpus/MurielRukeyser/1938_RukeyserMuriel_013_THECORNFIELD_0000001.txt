1 Error, disease, snow, sudden weather. 2 For those given 
to contemplation : this house, 3 wading in snow, its 
cracks are sealed with clay, 4 walls papered with print, 
newsprint repeating, 5 in-focus grey across the room, and squared 
6 ads for a book : HEAVEN'S MY DESTINATION, 7 
HEAVEN'S MY . . . HEAVEN . . . . 
THORNTON WILDER. 8 The long-faced man rises long-handed jams the 
door 9 tight against snow, long-boned, he shivers. 10 Contemplate. 
11 Swear by the corn, 12 the found-land corn, those 
who like ritual. He 13 rides in a good car. 
They say blind corpses rode 14 with him in front, 
knees broken into angles, 15 head clamped ahead. Overalls. Affidavits. 
16 He signs all papers. His office : where he 
sits. 17 feet on the stove, loaded trestles through door, 
18 satin-lined, silk-lined, unlined, cheap, 19 The papers in the 
drawer. On the desk, photograph 20 H. C. White, Funeral 
Services (new car and eldest son); 21 tells about Negroes 
who got wet at work, 22 shot craps, drank and 
took cold, pneumonia, died. 23 Shows the sworn papers. Swear 
by the corn. 24 Pneumonia, pneumonia, pleurisy, t.b. 25 For 
those given to voyages : these roads 26 discover gullies, 
invade, Where does it go now? 27 Now turn upstream 
twenty-five yards. Now road again. 28 Ask the man on 
the road. Saying, That cornfield? 29 Over the second hill, 
through the gate, 30 watch for the dogs. Buried, five 
at a time, 31 pine boxes, Rinehart & Dennis paid 
him $55 32 a head for burying these men in 
plain pine boxes. 33 His mother is suing him : 
misuse of land. 34 George Robinson : I knew a 
man 35 who died at four in the morning at 
the camp. 36 At seven his wife took clothes to 
dress her dead 37 husband, and at the undertaker's 38 
they told her the husband was already buried. 39 ---Tell 
me this, the men with whom you are acquainted, 40 
the men who have this disease 41 have been told 
that sooner or later they are going to die? 42 
---Yes, sir. 43 ---How does that seem to affect the 
majority of the people? 44 ---It don't work on anything 
but their wind. 45 ---Do they seem to be living 
in fear 46 or do they wish to die? 47 
---They are getting to breathe a little faster. 48 For 
those given to keeping their own garden : 49 Here 
is the cornfield, white and wired by thorns, 50 old 
cornstalks, snow, the planted home. 51 Stands bare against a 
line of farther field, 52 unmarked except for wood stakes, 
charred at tip, 53 few scratched and named (pencil or 
nail). 54 Washed-off. Under the mounds, 55 all the anonymous. 
56 Abel America, calling from under the corn, 57 Earth, 
uncover my blood! 58 Did the undertaker know the man 
was married? 59 Uncover. 60 Do they seem to fear 
death? 61 Contemplate. 62 Does Mellon's ghost walk, povertied at 
last, 63 walking in furrows of corn, still sowing, 64 
do apparitions come? 65 Voyage. 66 Think of your gardens. 
But here is corn to keep. 67 Marked pointed sticks 
to name the crop beneath. 68 Sowing is over, harvest 
is coming ripe. 69 ---No, sir; they want to go 
on. 70 They want to live as long as they 
can.
