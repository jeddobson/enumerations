1 In burning summer I saw a season of betrayal, 
2 the world fell away, and wasteful climbing green 3 
covered the breaking of bodies, covered our hearts. 4 Unreal 
in the burning, many-motioned life 5 lay like a sea, 
but fevers found my grief. 6 I turned in that 
year to retrieve the stainless river, 7 the lost, the 
flowing line of escaped music. 8 Year of judgment! Century 
of betrayal! 9 They built their cities on the banks 
of war 10 and all their cities are down, the 
Floating Man 11 swims in the smoke of their sky, 
the Double Woman 12 smiles up through the water with 
her distorted mouth. 13 I stand over reflection as the 
world darkens in 14 destruction of countries, all souls downward 
set, 15 life narrowing to one color of a choked 
river 16 and hell on both its banks. My city, 
my city! 17 They never built cities. Cities are for 
the living. 18 They built for the half-dead and the 
half-alive. 19 Their history is a half-history. And we go 
down. 20 They built their villages whose lame towers fell 
21 where error was overgrown until the long 22 tentacular 
ruin touches all fields. My love! 23 Did I in 
that country build you villages? 24 Great joy my love, 
even there, until they fell 25 and green betrayal climbed 
over the wall. 26 Defeat and raging and a burning 
river. 27 Half-faced, half-sexed, the living dead arrive 28 passing, 
a lip, a breast, half of a hand. 29 Gaudy 
sadistic streets, dishonest avenues 30 where every face has bargained 
for its eyes. 31 And they come down to the 
river, driven down. 32 And all the faces fly out 
of my city. 33 The rich streets full of empty 
coats parading 34 and one adolescent protesting violin, 35 the 
slums full of their flayed and faceless bodies, 36 they 
shiver, they are working to buy their skin. 37 They 
are lost. They come down to look for life in 
a river, 38 plunge, turn and plunge, they cannot change 
their life, 39 swimming, their head is in another world. 
40 World without form. Chaos beaten and beaten, 41 raging 
and suffering and hoping to take shape. 42 I saw 
your summer. I saw your river flow. 43 I being 
wasted everywhere saw waste. 44 Hell's entropy at work and 
torment general, 45 friend against most-known friend, love fighting off 
love. 46 They asked for an end to emptiness; their 
sick throats filled 47 with foam, 48 prayed to be 
solved, and rose to deal betrayal. 49 And I falling 
through hell passed many friends, and love, 50 and a 
haunted woman warned me as I fell. 51 Downward through 
currents, the horrors with little hands. 52 The chaos, the 
web of the heart, this bleeding knot; 53 raises me 
swimming now, one moment in the air 54 and light 
is on my face, the fans over the river 55 
of wind, of goodness. Lie gasping on this shore, 56 
there is nothing in the world but an honest word 
57 which the severed-away may speak before we die. 58 
Let me tell you what I have held to all 
along: 59 when I said that I loved you, when 
I crossed the frontier, 60 when I learned the obscurities 
of a frightened child, 61 when I shut the door, 
and felt the sprouting tears, 62 when I saw the 
river, when I learned resurrection, 63 the joy of your 
hands in a pain that called More Life. 64 Let 
me tell you what I have meant all along: 65 
meaning of poetry and personal love, 66 a world of 
peace and freedom, man's need recognized, 67 and all the 
agonies that will begin that world. 68 Betrayed, we are 
betrayed. The set of the great faces 69 mean it, 
the following eyes. They are the flayed men, 70 their 
strength is at the center, love and the time's disease 
71 lie at their skin. The kiss in the flaring 
garden 72 when all the trees closed in. The knotted 
terrible lips. 73 The black blood risen and the animal 
rage. 74 The last fierce accident, whose back-thrown drowning head 
75 among the escaping sound of water hears 76 slow 
insane music groping for a theme. 77 My love, reach 
me again. The smell of the sea, 78 wind-flower, sea-flower, 
the fallen gull-feather. 79 Clear water and order and an 
end to dreams: 80 ether-dreams, surrounded beasts, the aftertoll of 
fear, 81 the world reduced to a rising line of 
water, 82 the patient deserted by the analyst. 83 To 
keep the knowledge that holds my race alive: 84 spiritual 
grace of the material word. 85 I walked under the 
sky, and the high clouds 86 hollowed in ribs arched 
over their living heart: 87 the world, the corporeal world 
that will not die, 88 No, world's no heart---here is 
yourself walking 89 in a cage of clouds looking up 
wanting one face 90 over you and that look to 
fill the sky. 91 Carrying counter-agony into the world, 92 
dream-singing, river-madness, the tragic fugal love 93 of a theme 
balancing another theme. 94 Disorder of suffering, a flight of 
details, a world 95 with no shadows at noontime and 
never at night a light, 96 Suddenly the flame-blue of 
a drunken sky 97 and it is the change, the 
reds and metals of autumn, 98 But I curse autumn, 
for I do not change, 99 I love, I love, 
and we are far from peace, 100 and the great 
river moves unbearably; 101 actual gestures of giving, and I 
may not give. 102 Water will hold my shadows, the 
kiss of darkness, 103 maternal death's tender and delicate promises 
104 seethe at the lips, release and the full sleep. 
105 Even now the bright corporeal hand 106 might come 
to redeem the long moment of dying, 107 Even now
