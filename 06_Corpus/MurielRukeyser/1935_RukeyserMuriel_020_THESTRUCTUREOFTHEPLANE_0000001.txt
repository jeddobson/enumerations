1 Kitty Hawk is a Caesar among monuments; 2 the 
stiff bland soldiers predestined to their death 3 the bombs 
piled neatly like children's marbles piled 4 sperm to breed 
corpses eugenically by youth 5 out of seductive death. 6 
The hill outdoes our towers 7 we might treasure a 
thistle grown from a cannon-mouth 8 they have not permitted 
rust and scum and blossoms 9 to dirty the steel, 
10 however we have the plane 11 the hill, flower 
among monuments. 12 "To work intelligently" (Orville and Wilbur Wright) 
13 "one needs to know the effects of variations 14 
incorporated in the surfaces . . . . The pressures 
on squares 15 are different from those on rectangles, circles, 
triangles, or 16 ellipses . . . 17 The shape 
of the edge also makes a difference." 18 The plane 
is wheeled out of the hangar. The sleeves shake 19 
fixing the wind, the four o'clock blue sky 20 blinks 
in the goggles swinging over his wrist. 21 The plane 
rests, the mechanic in cream-colored overalls 22 encourages the engine 
into idling speed. 23 The instructor looks at his class 
24 and begins the demonstration. 25 "We finally became discouraged, 
and returned to kite-flying. 26 But as we grew older 
we had to give up this sport, 27 it was 
unbecoming to boys of our ages." 28 On the first 
stroke of the piston the intake valve opens, 29 the 
piston moves slowly from the head of the cylinder, 30 
drawing in its mixture of gas and air. On the 
second stroke 31 the piston returns, the valve closes. The 
mixture is 32 compressed. 33 A spark occurs, igniting America, 
opening India, 34 finding the Northwest Passage, Cipango spice, 35 
causing the mixture to burn, expanding the gases 36 which 
push the piston away on the power stroke. 37 The 
final exhaust stroke serves to release the gases, 38 allowing 
the piston to scavenge the cylinder. 39 We burn space, 
we sever galaxies, 40 solar systems whirl about Shelley's head, 
41 we give ourselves ease, gentlemen, art and these explosions 
42 and Peter Ronsard finger-deep in roses ; 43 gentlemen, 
remember these incandescent points, 44 remember to check, remember to 
drain the oil, 45 remember Plato O remember me 46 
the college pathways rise 47 the president's voice intoning sonnets 
48 the impress of hoofmarks on the bridle path 49 
the shining girls the lost virginities 50 the plane over 
a skeletal water-tower 51 our youth dissolving O remember 52 
romantically dissolving remember me. 53 Blue smoke from the exhaust 
signifies too much oil. 54 Save yourselves from excesses, dirt, 
and tailspins. 55 These are the axioms : stability, control, 
56 and equilibrium : in a yaw, in a roll, 
or pitch. 57 Here, gentlemen, are the wings, of fabric 
doped and painted 58 here is the rudder 59 here 
the propeller spins 60 : BE hammers in the brain 
61 FLY and the footbeat of that drum 62 may 
not be contradicted 63 must be mine 64 must be 
made ours, say the brothers Wright together 65 although the 
general public had been invited 66 few dared a cold 
December 67 in order to see another plane not fly. 
68 The helmet is strapped tight, orders are shouted 69 
the elbows of steel move in oil 70 air is 
forced under the ship, the pilot's hand 71 is safe 
on the stick, the young student sits 72 with the 
wind mottling his eyelashes, rigidly. 73 Centuries fall behind his 
brain, the motor 74 pushes in a four-beat rhythm, his 
blood moves, 75 he dares look at the levels mounting 
in clouds 76 the dropping fields of the sky the 
diminishment of earth ; 77 now he thinks I am 
the child crying Mother 78 this rim is the threshold 
into the hall's night 79 or the windowsill livened with 
narcissus. 80 The white edge of the bath a moment 
before 81 slipping into watery ease, the windowsill 82 eager 
for the jump into the street 83 the hard stone 
under my back, the earth 84 with its eyes and 
hands its eyes and hands 85 its eyes 86 fixed 
eyes on the diminishing 87 take me back the bath 
had fronds of steam 88 escaping the hands held my 
head 89 my eyes slipped in oil looking along your 
beauty 90 earth is painful the distance hurts 91 mother 
the night, the distance, dear 92 he is standing with 
one look of hate upon him 93 screams at the 
pilot you bastard, you bastard, jumps 94 trailing a long 
scream above him, the plane yaws down, 95 the motor 
pulls heavily, the ground is dark November, 96 his parachute 
opens a bright plume surrendering downward, 97 the plane heads 
up again, no good in following, 98 continues unfascinated by 
night or land or death.99 "Well," he said, "George, I 
never thought you were with us. 100 You walked out 
of the shaft as if you'd spent years of your 
life 101 planning some day to walk out once without 
blinking 102 and not stop for a smoke but walk 
over to our side." 103 "No," he said, "I never 
expected to. It was only the last 104 cut: 105 
before that, I'd have worked no matter who starved first." 
106 The snow was stamped down with black nailprints 107 
the stamping was a drum to warm them, stiff veins, 
crusted 108 hands. 109 "Carrying guns, boys!" said the director. 
"Now, boys; 110 I'll speak to the others and see 
what I can do." 111 The heavy-set miner spat on 
the peel of snow. 112 The fingers weighed on the 
triggers. December bit 113 into the bone, into the tight 
skulls, creaking one word. 114 Tell how the men watched 
the table, a plate of light, 115 the rigid faces 
lit around it, the mouths 116 opening and clamping, the 
little warmth 117 watched against the shafts of the breakers.
