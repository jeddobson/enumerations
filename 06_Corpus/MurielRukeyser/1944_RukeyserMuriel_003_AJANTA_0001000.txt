nothing clean in me is more than cloud 119 Unless 
you call it. ---As I ran I heard 120 A 
black voice beating among all that blood: 121 "Try to 
live as if there were a God."122 Came to Ajanta 
cave, the painted space of the breast, 123 The real 
world where everything is complete, 124 There are no shadows, 
the forms of incompleteness. 125 The great cloak blows in 
the light, rider and horse arrive, 126 The shoulders turn 
and every gift is made. 127 No shadows fall. There 
is no source of distortion. 128 In our world, a 
tree casts the shadow of a woman, 129 A man 
the shadow of a phallus, a hand raised 130 The 
shadow of the whip. 131 Here everything is itself, 132 
Here all may stand 133 On summer earth. 134 Brightness 
has overtaken every light, 135 And every myth netted itself 
in flesh. 136 New origins, and peace given entire 137 
And the spirit alive. 138 In the shadowless cave 139 
The naked arm is raised. 140 Animals arrive, 141 Interlaced, 
and gods 142 Interlaced, and men 143 Flame-woven. 144 I 
stand and am complete. 145 Crawls from the door, 146 
Black at my two feet 147 The shadow of the 
world. 148 World, not yet one, 149 Enters the heart 
again. 150 The naked world, and the old noise of 
tears, 151 The fear, the expiation and the love, 152 
A world of the shadowed and alone. 153 The journey, 
and the struggles of the moon.
