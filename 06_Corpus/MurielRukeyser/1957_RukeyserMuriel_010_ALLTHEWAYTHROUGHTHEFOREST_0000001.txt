1 All the way through the forest, a sound of 
birdsong, 2 The lightning-bird singing through the wilderness. 3 I 
see him flying before the invented speed. Body of shadow, 
4 wings of light, 5 In the leaf forest and 
the needle forest. Clusters of song flying 6 Past the 
thickets unbroken, and glimpses of river 7 And the dual-noted 
thrush, two or three times. 8 Just after the steaming 
rains, when each leaf stands up clear 9 Individual on 
the branch, when the tree has made its relation 10 
With the slope of hillside and the strike of starlight, 
bearing each 11 storm of its lifetime in its body, 
and standing 12 In the relation to the rest of 
the forests---just after the form-giving 13 storms and the rains 
of growth 14 A car full of men drives into 
this country. One man gets out, 15 slams the car 
door, 16 Saying, "I want to walk. Wait for me 
up the road." 17 His smile suddenly brutal, "I want 
to see it before it sees me." 18 After the 
road, the woods are axless and pathless; the great 19 
mists 20 Hang over the sycamores, darkening and thickening in 
the 21 stillness 22 Above the black-green, into the green. 
The man's walking 23 Bends the small pliant branches. One 
note of the car horn 24 Gives him direction : 
he keeps his shoulder to it, and goes 25 with 
his arm braced 26 Pushing through the forest. Deep grass 
and moss bed 27 Cover the rock, cover the ledge, 
cover the fallen tree. 28 Far ahead, the distant green 
of spring shining on dogwood 29 where the light falls 
through, 30 The ribs, the braces of trees. Along these 
arches 31 He sees the bear turning away from him, 
browner than 32 branches. 33 Everything glitters. The full drop 
hangs 34 On the hard bud. 35 Underfoot, moss springs 
down, leaving water. 36 The drop trembles. 37 He goes 
invading. 38 Bright the drop falls. 39 His face hardens 
with his inward glare. 40 Goes plunging through the forest. 
41 Spruce, firs. The oxalis ground, the fern of the 
woods, 42 In delicate tolerance, the patience balancing, 43 Bending 
and recording. 44 Now the sawbriars 45 Catch him, and 
his breath hisses caught. 46 Before his foot. The snakehead 
prodding the air, 47 Erect and advanced from the thick 
coil, 48 Silent, not calling on his rattles. Touching and 
touching 49 The space between them. 50 He stares at 
the snake. It glitters and glistens before him. 51 The 
guardian; and a darkness winds his face. 52 The forest 
stands as free behind as it stands before him; but 
a 53 limit 54 Has been marked, a threshold indicated 
in the coil. 55 He waits. He knows that if 
at the end of the long waiting, 56 Unendurable waiting, 
if then he can go ahead, he will come into 
57 a further country. 58 A leaf comes down, a 
hand in the air 59 Rocking down, and the snake 
withdraws his head, 60 In an arch over a coil 
assumes his next shape, 61 Looks once at the man, 
a flat unlit stare 62 Before he pours himself away. 
63 A little moving water is left where he was, 
64 Moving silver like the model of a river 65 
Before it exhales upward into the branches. 66 The man 
walks over the earth where it was. 67 He pushes 
further into wilderness 68 With a stirring in himself of 
sadness, 69 Of past fear and of recognition. 70 A 
word has been spoken in a language 71 For which 
he has been homesick. 72 This is a language which 
he cannot remember, 73 All he knows is that he 
knows the word. 74 The word of the snake. 75 
Deep grass and moss bed 76 A murmur of wells. 
77 Before him, a cleft of rock 78 Holding water 
moving and curving. 79 Strung from rock to rock across 
his path 80 He sees his way crossed by a 
spider web. 81 Spiderspan wider than spears met to guard 
82 The gates of the forest. 83 It shivers in 
the light, a faint breeze 84 Sways it like fantasies 
of bridges in India. 85 The man knows this is 
the final obstacle. 86 The bull of dream lowers his 
head now, he shuts his bull-blue 87 eyes, 88 Now 
he is running and he jumps the water, 89 Tearing 
the web. 90 It is torn, it sticks to his 
fingers and his hair; 91 He has cleared in one 
jump the forest; he is standing 92 On a shoulder 
of rock above a hidden farm. 93 The man is 
dropping down, dropping down 94 To a green yard and 
growing grass 95 And a woman with a water-pail 96 
Standing in the doorway. 97 This is a young woman, 
big-breasted, slender-waisted, 98 Sets her pail on the floor, smoothes 
her straw-bright hair, 99 Waits for his nearing. Morning, he 
greets her. Morning, she answers. You came down from the 
overhang. That's a knotty way. There's the path just beside 
you. She looks at his thorn-caught legs. He smiles; for 
anyone else he would feel a fool. He has only 
a city answer : It's been years since I walked 
through anything but streets or parks. I wanted to see 
them building from this side. 101 ---Streets and parks are 
far from home 102 Can you hear the river from 
here? 103 The sound of building in the air? 104 
---All I hear is rushing of water, very near. 105 
---Down in the gully, come and see, 106 April water 
doing ruin. 107 We've had some ruin here. 108 You've 
got honey in your hair, Mister. 109 He puts his 
hand up to his head and touches 110 The sticky 
places. The web adheres. 111 I came through a spider-web, 
he says and laughs--- 112 They look through each other's
