1 The child wakes in the morning to enter a 
country 2 Where the rivers are striped with fire and 
the tigers 3 Say their word before they eat you, 
and the leaves cry out 4 And the stars are 
the parts of song. They are music 5 And they 
stand clear in the blue and risen sky. 6 The 
tigers eat them and the child eats them. 7 Do 
birds eat stars? 8 They do. And morning. And all 
doorkeepers.
