1 The quick sun brings, exciting mountains warm, 2 gay 
on the landscapers and green designs, 3 miracle, yielding the 
sex up under all the skin, 4 until the entire 
body watches the scene with love, 5 sees perfect cliffs 
ranging until the river 6 cuts sheer, mapped far below 
in delicate track, 7 surprise of grace, the water running 
in the sun, 8 magnificent flower on the mouth, surprise 
9 as lovers who look too long on the desired 
face 10 startle to find the remote flesh so warm. 
11 A day of heat shed on the gorge, a 
brilliant 12 day when love sees the sun behind its 
man 13 and the disguised marvel under familiar skin. 14 
Steel-bright, light-pointed, the narrow-waisted towers 15 lift their protective network, 
the straight, the accurate 16 flex of distinction, economy of 
gift, 17 gymnast, they poise their freight; god's generosity! give 
18 their voltage low enough for towns to handle. 19 
The power-house stands skin-white at the transmitters' side 20 over 
the rapids the brilliance the blind foam. 21 This is 
the midway between water and flame, 22 this is the 
road to take when you think of your country, 23 
between the dam and the furnace, terminal. 24 The clean 
park, fan of wires, landscapers, 25 the stone approach. And 
seen beyond the door, 26 the man with the flashlight 
in his metal hall. 27 Here, the effective green, grey-toned 
and shining, 28 tall immense chamber of cylinders; Green, 29 
the rich paint catches light from three-story windows, 30 arches 
of light vibrate erratic panels on 31 sides of curved 
steel. Man pockets flashlight, 32 useless, the brilliant floor casts 
tiled reflection up, 33 bland walls return it, circles pass 
it round. 34 Wheels, control panels, dials, the vassal instruments. 
35 This is the engineer Jones, the blueprint man, 36 
loving the place he designed, visiting it alone. 37 Another 
blood, no cousin to the town; 38 rings his heels 
on stone, pride follows his eyes, 39 "This is the 
place." 40 Four generators, smooth green, and squares of black, 
41 floored-over space for a fifth. 42 The stairs. Descend. 
43 "They said I built the floor like the tiles 
of a bank, 44 I wanted the men who work 
here to be happy." 45 Light laughing on steel, the 
gay, the tall sun 46 given away; mottled; snow comes 
in clouds; 47 the iron steps go down as roads 
go down. 48 This is the second circle, world of 
inner shade, 49 hidden bulk of generators, governor shaft, 50 
round gap of turbine pit. Flashlight. tool-panels, 51 heels beating 
on iron, cold of underground, 52 stairs, wire flooring, the 
voice's bellow cry. 53 This is the scroll, the volute 
case of night, 54 quick shadow and the empty galleries. 
55 Go down; here are the outlets, butterfly valves 56 
open from here, the tail-race, vault of steel, 57 the 
spiral staircase ending, last light in shaft. 58 "Gone," says 
the thin straight man. 59 "'Hail, holy light, offspring of 
Heav'n first-born, 60 'Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam 61 
'May I express thee unblamed?'" 62 And still go down. 
63 Now ladder-mouth; and the precipitous fear, 64 uncertain rungs 
down into after-night. 65 "This is the prace. Away from 
this my life 66 I am indeed Adam unparadiz'd. 67 
Some fools call this the Black Hole of Calcutta, 68 
I don't know how they ever get to Congress." 69 
Gulfs, spirals, that the drunken ladder swings, 70 its rungs 
give, pliant, beneath the leaping heart. 71 Leaps twice at 
midnight. But a naked bulb 72 makes glare, turns paler, 
burns to dark again. 73 Brilliance begins, scutters. And comes 
upon 74 after the tail abstract, the ill, the unmasked 
men, 75 the independent figure of the welder 76 masked 
for his work; acts with unbearable flame. 77 His face 
is a cage of steel, the hands are covered, 78 
points dazzle hot, fly from his writing corch, 79 brighten 
the face and hands marrying steel. 80 Says little, works 
: only : "A little down, 81 five men were 
killed in the widening of the tunnel." 82 Shell of 
bent metal; walking along an arc 83 the tube rounds 
up about your shoulders, black 84 circle, great circle, down 
infinite mountains rides, 85 echoes words, footsteps, testimonies. 86 "One 
said the air was thin Fifth-Avenue clean." 87 The iron 
pillars mark a valve division, 88 four tunnels merging. Iron 
on iron resounds, 89 echoes along created gorges. "Sing, 90 
test echoes, sing : Pilgrim," he cries. 91 singing Once 
More, Dear Home, 92 as all the light burns out. 
93 Down the reverberate channels of the hills 94 the 
suns declare midnight, go down, cannot ascend, 95 no ladder 
back; see this, your eyes can ride through steel, 96 
this is the river Death. diversion of power, 97 the 
root of tower and the tunnel's core, 98 this is 
the end.
