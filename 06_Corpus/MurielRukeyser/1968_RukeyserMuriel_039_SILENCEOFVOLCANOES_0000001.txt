1 The mountains and the shadows move away 2 Under 
their snows to show an immense scene: 3 A field 
of cathedrals. Green domes eye-green, 4 Domes the color of 
trumpets. Obliterated rose 5 And impure copper. Vaults are pale 
shoulders. 6 Grass-haired and deformed, 7 The dome-capped pyramid to 
the god of the air. 8 A white dome under 
these volcanoes. 9 This is the field that glittered in 
massacre, 10 Time is boiling with domes.11 A woman has 
been begging for ninety-seven years. 12 The singing of her 
words against shadows of gold. 13 I see her lean 
her face against this scene. 14 The domes dissolve. All 
her unfallen tears. 15 I remember a room for sale 
in a picture 16 Torn as this landscape 17 Obsessed 
by a single thing.18 A hall at the National Pawnshop 
crowded with unsold bureaus. 19 In sharp paint at the 
end of a blind aisle 20 Red-robed and listening, the 
saint looks at the Sign. 21 Books fold him in, 
strict black-and-white tile 22 Lead to a sleeping garden where 
his lion, 23 The guardian, lies in a silence of 
volcanoes. 24 Hung in that air, there pierces his leaning 
soul 25 The cheap tin trumpet that is the voice 
of God.
