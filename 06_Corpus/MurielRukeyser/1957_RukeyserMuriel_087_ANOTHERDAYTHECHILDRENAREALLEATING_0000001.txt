---Do not say that is so. Anything like that. We 
are good and 3 rich. 4 ---Baloney. 5 ---Baloney is

meat. 6 Words still do tell about things. 7 The 
word says what is the thing. 8 It must be, 
or how would you know? 9 Baloney is a word, 
Tom. 10 ---What? 11 ---Oh!... You are too little for 
me. When I drink milk I put my nose in 
it, way, and blow, foo, and it makes sprickles, fat.
