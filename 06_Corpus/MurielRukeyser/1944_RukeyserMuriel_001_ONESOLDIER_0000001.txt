1 When I think of him, midnight 2 Opens about 
me, and I am more alone; 3 But then the 
poems flower from the bone.--- 4 You came to me 
bearing the truth in your two hands; 5 I sit 
and look down at my hand like an astonished 6 
Fortune-teller, seeing the mortal flesh. 7 Your wish was strong 
the first day of the war 8 For it had 
been strong before, and then we knew 9 All that 
I had to be, you had to do. 10 Once 
when you stood before me, kisses rose 11 About my 
lips; poems at my lips rise, 12 Your live belief 
fills midnight and my eyes.
