1 The risen image shines, its force escapes, we are 
all named. 2 Now that the threads are held; now 
that the footcuts hold 3 where these intent finders of 
tumult climbed 4 in music or mathematical intensity, 5 and 
paint, or fire, or order, found and held, 6 their 
achieved spirits gleam. In the dark perfect sky 7 a 
hand is risen firm under its crackling globe of flame. 
8 Against the stare it floats, over our agony of 
street, 9 repeated eyes, disclosures and closures of walls, 10 
glimpses of centuries until the shining fails. 11 The faces 
are normal; the superhuman light saves, kills, and 12 saves; 
13 is mixed, and they fall fighting; and wake to 
climb the streets 14 in the vigor of their blood 
grown changed and abstract, 15 whose faces begotten of faces 
crack in their bitterness 16 light through all faces with 
the familiar strain 17 of features that have earned a 
general grace; 18 in a fountain of energy shining among 
the graves 19 earned human meaning and fantastic flame--- 20 
hold pitiless under street-flares colors of night, react, 21 remain 
in a passion of daybreak effort when the day arrives. 
22 They are real whereof the ancestors were dreams, 23 
hallucination and loneliness and the creative yoke. 24 And they 
may break the eyes to water or ease like starlight 
in 25 tormented cities whose shops and savage parks 26 
are the star-chamber of a furious race, 27 whose warehouses, 
tenements, equations, song 28 have risen in complexity among 29 
old portraits, flayed men, skeletons of slaves, and women 30 
with brilliant carriage and averted face 31 proving a paranoiac 
rule tricking to death its children. 32 But there are 
more in the scheme : the many-born 33 charging our 
latest moment with their wave, 34 a shaking sphere whose 
center names us all as core, 35 risen among the 
timid and the torn 36 toward the sun-cities which the 
brain has known 37 whose moment of proof races through 
time to live. 38 These faces have risen, destroyed, found 
and still find 39 antagonisms of life, the dreamed and 
half-known world, 40 awakened forms among the profuse creative 41 
promises of the mind.
