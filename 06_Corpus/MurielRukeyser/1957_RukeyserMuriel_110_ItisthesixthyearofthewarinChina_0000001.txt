1 It is the sixth year of the war in 
China. 2 The children of the first winter help with 
the babies. 3 Not even a clash in the north 
for some time now. 4 The Long March is legend; 
Taerchwang's a song; 5 Splinters of autumn drift over this 
year. 6 How can strangers be told? A soldier stands 
still, 7 He wavers on his feet; the army has 
stood for three years, 8 Lacking the strength to advance. 
9 The boys who went away to war five years 
ago 10 Wrote a letter or two, then died; anyway 
did not write. 11 The soldiers waver, are thin in 
their torn clothes. 12 But they hold. The cliff-city holds. 
13 Not the blazing, not the wild turning, not the 
lonely stand. 14 There was a silence then; but now 
the fire has fallen 15 On the exotic silent cities, 
in a storm on London. 16 Not alone, not unknown 
here, faces endowed with stillness. 17 "The general's white hair, 
and the soldier's tears."
