1 After the last freeze, in easy air, 2 Once 
the danger is past, we cut them back severely; 3 
Pruning the weakest hardest, pruning for size 4 Of flower, 
we deprived will not deprive the sturdy. 5 The new 
shoots are preserved, the future bush 6 Cut down to 
a couple of young dormant buds. 7 But the early 
sun of April does not burn our lives : 8 
Light straight and fiery brings back the enemies. 9 Claw, 
jaw, and crawler, all those that devour. 10 We work 
with smoke against the robber blights, 11 With copper against 
rust; the season fights itself 12 In deep strong rich 
loam under swarm attacks. 13 Head hidden from the wind, 
the power of form 14 Rises among these brightnesses, thorned 
and blowing. 15 Where they glow on the earth, water-drops 
tremble on them. 16 Soon we must cut them back, 
against damage of storms. 17 But those days gave us 
flower budded on flower, 18 A moment of light achieved, 
deep in the air of roses.
