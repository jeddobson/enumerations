1 Knowledge my nakedness, 2 Where is the accurate, the 
innocent skillful man, 3 The accurate shining, behind whose forehead 
lie what young 4 dreams? 5 I am the present, 
and I know your face. 6 Mercy must enter grace, 
7 Wisdom this wilderness. 8 These are thick forest fears 
whose hidden rivers 9 Are the past under leaves feeding 
each taproot of our lives. 10 The present touches again, 
again, again, continual music. 11 The touching by majestic images 
of common day. 12 Have you looked at the Bible 
since you changed your mind? 13 Certain Mozart applies, recurrences 
of Beethoven; 14 All are true. 15 And now only 
the new is accurate.
