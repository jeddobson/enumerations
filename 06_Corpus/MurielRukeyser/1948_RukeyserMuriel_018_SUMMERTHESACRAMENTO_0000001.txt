1 To this bridge the pale river and flickers away 
in images of blue. 2 And is gone. While behind 
me the stone mountains 3 stand brown with blue lights; 
at my right shoulder standing 4 Shasta, in summer standing, 
blue with her white lights 5 near a twilight summer 
moon, whiter than snow 6 where the light of evening 
changes among these legends. 7 Under me islands lie green, 
planted with green feathers, 8 green growing, shadowy grown, gathering 
streams of the 9 green trees. 10 A hundred streams 
full of shadows and your upland source 11 pulled past 
sun-islands, green in this light as grace, 12 risen from 
your sun-mountains where your voices go 13 returning to water 
and music is your face. 14 Flows to the flower-haunted 
sea, naming and singing, under my eyes 15 coursing, the 
day of the world. And the time of my spirit 
16 streams 17 before me, slow autumn colors, the cars 
of a long train; 18 earth-red, earth-orange, leaf, rust, twilight 
of earth 19 stream past the evening river and over 
into the dark of north, 20 stream slow like wishes 
continuing toward those snows.
