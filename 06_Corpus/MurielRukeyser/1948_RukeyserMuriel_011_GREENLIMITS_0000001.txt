1 My limits crowd around me 2 like years, like 
those I loved 3 whose narrow hope could never 4 
carry themselves. 5 My limits stand beside me 6 like 
those two widowed aunts 7 who from an empty beach 
8 tore me into the wave. 9 Green over my 
low head 10 the surf threw itself down 11 tall 
as my aunts whose hands 12 locked me past help. 
13 The sand was far behind 14 and rushing underfoot 
15 water and fear and childhood, 16 surf of love. 
17 Green limits walled me, water 18 stood higher than 
I saw--- 19 glass walls, fall back! let me 20 
dive and be saved. 21 My limits stand inside me 
22 forever like that wave 23 on which I ride 
at last 24 over and under me.
