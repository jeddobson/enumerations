1 The fear of poetry is the 2 fear : 
mystery and fury of a midnight street 3 of windows 
whose low voluptuous voice 4 issues, and after that there 
is no peace. 5 That round waiting moment in the 
6 theatre : curtain rises, dies into the ceiling 7 
and here is played the scene with the mother 8 
bandaging a revealed son's head. The bandage is torn off. 
9 Curtain goes down. And here is the moment of 
proof. 10 That climax when the brain acknowledges the world. 
11 all values extended into the blood awake. 12 Moment 
of proof. And as they say Brancusi did, 13 building 
his bird to extend through soaring air, 14 as Kafka 
planned stories that draw to eternity 15 through time extended. 
And the climax strikes. 16 Love touches so, that months 
after the look of 17 blue stare of love, the 
footbeat on the heart 18 is translated into the pure 
cry of birds 19 following air-cries, or poems, the new 
scene. 20 Moment of proof. That strikes long after act. 
21 They fear it. They turn away, hand up palm 
out 22 fending off moment of proof, the straight look, 
poem. 23 The prolonged wound-consciousness after the bullet's shot. 24 
The prolonged love after the look is dead, 25 the 
yellow joy after the song of the sun.
