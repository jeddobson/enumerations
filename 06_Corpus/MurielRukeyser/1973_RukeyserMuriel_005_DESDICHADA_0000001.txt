1 For that you never acknowledged me, I acknowledge 2 
the spring's yellow detail, the every drop of rain, 3 
the anonymous unacknowledged men and women. 4 The shine as 
it glitters in our child's wild eyes, 5 one o'clock 
at night. This river, this city, 6 the years of 
the shadow on the delicate skin 7 of my hand, 
moving in time. 8 Disinherited, annulled, finally disacknowledged 9 and 
all of my own asking. I keep that wild dimension 
10 of life and making and the spasm 11 upon 
my mouth as I say this word of acknowledge 12 
to you forever. Ewig. Two o'clock at night.13 While this 
my day and my people are a country not yet 
born 14 it has become an earth I can 15 
acknowledge. I must. I know what the 16 disacknowledgment does. 
Then I do take you, 17 but far under consciousness, 
knowing 18 that under under flows a river wanting 19 
the other : to go open-handed in Asia, 20 to 
cleanse the tributaries and the air, to make for making, 
21 to stop selling death and its trash, pour plastic 
down men's 22 throats, 23 to let this child find, 
to let men and women find, 24 knowing the seeds 
in us all. They do say Find. 25 I cannot 
acknowledge it entire. But I will. 26 A beginning, this 
moment, perhaps, and you.27 Death flowing down past me, past 
me, death 28 marvelous, filthy, gold, 29 in my spine 
in my sex upon my broken mouth 30 and the 
whole beautiful mouth of the child; 31 shedding power over 
me 32 death 33 if I acknowledge him. 34 Leading 
me 35 in my own body 36 at last in 
the dance.
