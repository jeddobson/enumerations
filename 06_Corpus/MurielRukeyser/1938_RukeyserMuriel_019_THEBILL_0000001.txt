1 The subcommittee submits: 2 Your committee held hearings, heard 
many witnesses; finds: 3 THAT the Hawk's Nest tunnel was 
constructed 4 Dennis and Rinehart, Charlottesville, Va., for 5 New 
Kanawha Power Co., subsidiary of 6 Union Carbide & Carbon 
Co. 7 THAT a tunnel was drilled 8 app. dist. 
3.75 mis. 9 to divert water (from New River) 10 
to hydroelectric plant (Gauley Junction). 11 THAT in most of 
the tunnel, drilled rock contained 12 90---even 99 percent pure 
silica. 13 This is a fact that was known. 14 
THAT silica is dangerous to lungs of human beings. 15 
When submitted to contact. Silicosis. 16 THAT the effects are 
well known. 17 Disease incurable. 18 Physical incapacity, cases fatal. 
19 THAT the Bureau of Mines has warned for twenty 
years. 20 THAT prevention is: wet drilling, ventilation, 21 respirators, 
vacuum drills. 22 Disregard : utter. Dust : collected. Visibility 
: low. 23 Workmen left work, white with dust. 24 
Air system : inadequate. 25 It was quite cloudy in 
there. 26 When the drills were going, in all the 
smoke and dust, 27 it seemed like a gang of 
airplanes going through that 28 tunnel. 29 Respirators, not furnished. 
30 I have seen men with masks, but simply on 
their 31 breasts. 32 I have seen two wear them. 
33 Drills : dry drilling, for speed, for saving. 34 
A fellow could drill three holes dry for one hole 
wet. 35 They went so fast they didn't square at 
the top. 36 Locomotives : gasoline. Suffering from monoxide gas. 
37 There have been men that fell in the tunnel. 
They had 38 to be carried out. 39 The driving 
of the tunnel. 40 It was begun, continued, completed, with 
gravest 41 disregard. 42 And the employees? Their health, lives, 
future? 43 Results and infection. 44 Many died. Many are 
not yet dead. 45 Of negligence. Wilful or inexcusable. 46 
Further findings: 47 Prevalence : many States, mine, tunnel operations. 
48 A greatest menace. 49 We suggest hearings be read. 
50 This is the dark. Lights strung up all the 
way. 51 Depression; and, driven deeper in, 52 by hunger, 
pistols, and despair, 53 they took the tunnel. 54 Of 
the contracting firm 55 P. H. Faulconer, Pres. 56 E. 
J. Perkins, Vice-Pres. 57 have declined to appear. 58 They 
have no knowledge of deaths from silicosis. 59 However, their 
firm paid claims. 60 I want to point out that 
under the statute $500 or $1000, 61 but no more, 
may be recovered. 62 We recommend. 63 Bring them. Their 
books and records. 64 Investigate. Require. 65 Can do no 
more. 66 These citizens from many States 67 paying the 
price for electric power, 68 To Be Vindicated. "If by 
their suffering and death they will have made a future 
life safer for work beneath the earth, if they will 
have been able to establish a new and greater regard 
for human life in industry, their suffering may not have 
been in vain." Respectfully, Glenn Griswold Chairman, Subcommittee Vito Marcantonio 
W. P. Lambertson Matthew A. Dunn 72 The subcommittee subcommits. 
73 Words on a monument. 74 Capitoline thunder. It cannot 
be enough. 75 The origin of storms is not in 
clouds, 76 our lightning strikes when the earth rises, 77 
spillways free authentic power: 78 dead John Brown's body walking 
from a tunnel 79 to break the armored and concluded 
mind.
