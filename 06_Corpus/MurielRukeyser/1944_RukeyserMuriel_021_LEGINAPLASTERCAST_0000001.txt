1 When at last he was well enough to take 
the sun 2 He leaned on the nearest railing and 
summed up his sins, 3 Criminal weaknesses, deeds done and 
undone. 4 He felt he was healing. He guessed he 
was sane. 5 The convalescent gleam upon his skin, 6 
With his supported leg and an unknown 7 Recovery approaching 
let him black out pain. 8 The world promised recovery 
from his veins. 9 People said "Sin"; in the park 
everyone 10 Mentioned one miracle: "We must all be reborn." 
11 Across an accidental past the horns 12 Blasted through 
stone and barriers of sense 13 And the sound of 
a plaster cast knocking on stone. 14 He recognized the 
sound of fearful airmen 15 Returning, forerunners, and he could 
not run. 16 He saw they were not flying home 
alone. 17 He stood in a down-torn town of men 
and women 18 Whose wasted days poured on their heads 
as rain, 19 As sin, as fire---too lame, too late 
to turn, 20 For there, the air, everywhere full of 
planes.
