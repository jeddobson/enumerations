1 I go a road 2 among the upturned 3 
faces in their colors 4 to the great arch 5 
of a theatre stage 6 I the high queen 7 
starting in the air 8 far above my head 9 
royal of the crown 10 I the tower 11 go 
through the wide arch 12 proscenium queen 13 The arch 
shuts down like December 14 very small all about me 
15 the entrance to this country 16 Many whispers in 
the quick dark 17 Fingers in swarms, breath is busy, 
18 they have reached above my head 19 and taken 
off my crown 20 I go and I go 21 
I have been searching 22 since the light of all 
mornings 23 I remember only a pale brightness 24 and 
no more. What do I remember? 25 I no longer 
26 They have reached to my jewels 27 green in 
this cave, that one, iceberg the blue, 28 whirled into 
diamond 29 in the deep dark taken. 30 I move 
into thicker dark, 31 moss, earth-smell, wet coal. 32 Their 
hands are on my stiff robe. 33 I walk out 
of my robe. 34 At my surfaces 35 they unfasten 
my dress of softness. 36 Naked the naked wind 37 
of the underworld. 38 Rankness at my breasts, 39 over 
my flank 40 giggle and stink 41 They have taken 
little knives 42 my skin lifts off 43 I go 
in pain-colored black 44 trying to find 45 I walk 
into their asking 46 Where is he 47 they sing 
on one note 48 Your lord memory 49 He your 
delight 50 I cannot hear their music 51 it scrapes 
along my muscles 52 they make my flesh go 53 
among the gusts and whispers 54 they take off my 
eyes 55 my lips no more 56 the delicate fierce 
places 57 of identity 58 everywhere 59 taken 60 I, 
despoiled and clacking 61 walk, a chain of bones 62 
into the boneyard dark. 63 One by one. 64 Something 
65 reaches for my bones. 66 Something walks here 67 
a little breath in hell 68 without its ghost. 69 
A breath after nothing. 70 Gone. 71 Nothing turns the 
place 72 where perceiving was 73 from side to side. 
74 There is no place. It has dissolved. 75 The 
lowest point, back there, has slid away. 76 --- What 
are you working on? 77 --- Istar in the underworld. 
78 --- Baby, you are in trouble. 79 What calls 
her? 80 The body of a woman alive 81 but 
at the point of death, 82 the very old body 
lying there riddled with life, 83 gone, gasping at pain, 
84 fighting for words 85 fighting for breath. 86 One 
clear breast looks up out of this gone body 87 
young, the white clear light of this breast 88 speaks 
across distance 89 Remember is 90 come back. 91 Remember 
is 92 Who is here? 93 I am here. 94 
At the pit of the underworld 95 something flickers in 
her 96 without anything 97 Now I remember love 98 
who has set my being on me, 99 who permits 
me move 100 into all being, 101 who puts on 
me perceiving 102 and my bones 103 in a live 
chain 104 and my flesh that perceives 105 and acts 
106 and my acknowledging skin 107 my underdress, my dress 
108 and my robe 109 the jewels of the world 
110 I touch and find 111 ---I know him and 
I know 112 the breast speaking 113 out of a 
gone woman 114 across distances 115 And my crown a 
tower. 116 A voice saying : She went in a 
queen, 117 she died and came out, 118 goddess. 119 
All our faces in their colors 120 staring at the 
121 arch of this world. 122 The breast smiles : 
Do not 123 think you are invulnerable! 124 The breast 
smiles : Do not 125 think you are immortal!
