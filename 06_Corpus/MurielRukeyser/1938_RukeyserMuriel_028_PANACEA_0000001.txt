1 Make me well, I said.---And the delighted touch. 2 
You put dead sweet hand on my dead brain. 3 
The window cleared and the night-street stood black. 4 As 
soon as I left your house others besieged me 5 
forcing my motion, saying, Make me well. 6 Took sickness 
into the immense street, 7 but nothing was thriving I 
saw blank light the crazy 8 blink of torture the 
lack and there is no 9 personal sickness strong to 
intrude there. 10 Returned. Stood at the window. Make me 
well. 11 Cannot? The white sea, which is inviolable, 12 
is no greater, the disallied world's unable, 13 daylight horizons 
of lakes cannot caress me well. 14 The hypocrite leper 
in the parable, 15 did he believe would be kissed 
whole by kisses? 16 I'll try beyond you now. I'll 
try all flame. 17 Some force must be whole, some 
eye inviolable--- 18 look, here I am returned! No help. 
Gone high again; 19 legend's no precedent. This perseveres. 20 
The sun, I say, sincere, the sun, the sun.
