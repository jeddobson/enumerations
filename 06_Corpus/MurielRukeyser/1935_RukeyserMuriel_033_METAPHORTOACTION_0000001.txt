1 Whether it is a speaker, taut on a platform, 
2 who battles a crowd with the hammers of his 
words, 3 whether it is the crash of lips on 
lips 4 after absence and wanting : we must close 
5 the circuits of ideas, now generate, 6 that leap 
in the body's action or the mind's repose. 7 Over 
us is a striking on the walls of the sky, 
8 here are the dynamos, steel-black, harboring flame, 9 here 
is the man night-walking who derives 10 tomorrow's manifestoes from 
this midnight's meeting ; 11 here we require the proof 
in solidarity, 12 iron on iron, body on body, and 
the large single beating. 13 And behind us in time 
are the men who second us 14 as we continue. 
And near us is our love : 15 no forced 
contempt, no refusal in dogma, the close 16 of the 
circuit in a fierce dazzle of purity. 17 And over 
us is night a field of pansies unfolding, 18 charging 
with heat its softness in a symbol 19 to weld 
and prepare for action our minds' intensity.
