for Isaac Bashevis Singer 1 His tears fell from his 
veins 2 They spoke for six million 3 From his 
veins all their blood. 4 He told his stories. 5 
But noone spoke this language 6 Noone knew this music. 
7 His music went into all people 8 Not knowing 
this language. 9 It ran through their bodies 10 And 
they began to take his words 11 Everyone the tears 
12 Everyone the veins 13 But everyone said 14 Noone 
spoke this language.
