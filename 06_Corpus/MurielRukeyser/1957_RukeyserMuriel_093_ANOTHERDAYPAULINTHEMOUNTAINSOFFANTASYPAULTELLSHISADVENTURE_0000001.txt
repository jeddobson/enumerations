1 I pulled him back. 2 Do you know, Miss 
Lorence, why we were there, in those cold 3 dark 
mountains? We were running away from a man, from 4 
Hitler. 5 He was going to hurt me and to 
hurt the man worse. 6 Hitler is a bad thing. 
He is the worst thing in the world. 7 ... 
I helped the man. I did not let him fall. 
8 I helped him with the rope. 9 Do you 
know who I was helping? 10 I was helping Fritzel, 
my father, to get away from that bad land 11 
to come here where Mommy and Ropsie and I are, 
where it 12 is safe. 13 It is safe for 
a while. 14 It is more safe than it is 
in that bad land. 15 If you say anything or 
do anything that those people do not like 16 they 
may kill you or hunt you and you do not 
even know 17 why. 18 They kill you too if 
you are a Jew, even if you do not do 
any thing. 19 That is why I was taking my 
father away from that land. 20 ... This is not 
true, Miss Lorence. 21 I just pretend. 22 I would 
like to do that. 23 But I was not really 
in the tall mountains, 24 I did not really bring 
my father here. 25 When I get bigger I must 
do this. 26 But I am too little now. 27 
I used to think I could do anything, like this, 
28 Anything I wanted to, but now I am older 
29 And I know: 30 I am not old enough 
to do anything. 31 Children must wait to grow up. 
32 But I wish that I could help my Fritzel 
33 And there are other people who need to be 
helped. 34 It takes so long to grow.
