Act I, Sc. 4. She is lit, standing high, with 
the lit line of Anne's sleeping body at her knee. 
Darkness around. Her soliloquy will indicate the passage of a 
year. 1 A year passes behind me. Shadows grow larger. 
Time 2 dissolves to a moment. I look to my 
children. They 3 change. A smile, a brush of the 
lips against my heart; things 4 brighten and vanish into 
a kind of joy, a kind of light. 5 Chaos 
began us, war in my own time, war in my 
children's time, 6 irrevocable accusation! I have heard the music 
of the sounds 7 of peace: 8 music of rivers, 
of street-corners, of our South, 9 blues, harvest-songs; and in 
the faces of lovers 10 seen all our challenge shining 
as a sign 11 to shape the future in love 
and birth. 12 Women standing in their houses set around 
with order--- 13 the bread, the doorways and tables of 
everyday living 14 through all the walls have heard the 
shouts of fighting, 15 planes in the air, 16 and 
a shrill cry of women tortured under time, 17 each 
one carrying loss like conception : a lover gone, 18 
or a son, or her brothers disappeared. One saying, 19 
"Spain! Spain!" 20 One desolate for her unborn children. One 
standing alone 21 outside of lighted windows, or black against 
raving fires 22 of this year and next year. 23 
Chaos began us, a people skillful in war, young in 
love, 24 and in peace unbegun. A people various as 
life 25 whose strength is in our many voices and 
our hope 26 of a future of many, each singing 
his own song. 27 For we know this struggle : 
more than forces in conflict, 28 we know it as 
always the rising changing shadow of a dream. 29 A 
woman moving in my own house among my daughters, 30 
I remember their hands when they were little, and smoothing 
31 their shining hair. They change. And one will have 
her child. 32 The year passes. Around me chaos grows. 
33 And darkly 34 our time renews itself. And equilibrium, 
the healer, the 35 young one, 36 the beginning of 
new life, poises itself on war. And life 37 moves 
in its sharpened color into another year. 38 As I 
grow old, I face the strange seasons, I rejoice in 
the 39 young, 40 and I say, in suffering, in 
joy, among the marvelous changes, 41 among the accusations, all 
things glow.
