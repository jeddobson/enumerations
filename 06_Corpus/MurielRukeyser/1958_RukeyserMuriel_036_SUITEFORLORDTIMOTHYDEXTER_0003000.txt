In a snowstorm, the signs 239 In the seventh house. 
240 Mars came forward 241 Holding the candle--- 242 Jupiter 
stood by. 243 I was to be 244 One great 
man. 245 (I think I am a Quaker 246 But 
have so little sense 247 I can't deceive.) 248 The 
bubble is the soul ... 249 Man is the giant 
toad ... 250 I have thoughts about clocks 251 Nobody 
will believe. 252 Ask me and I will tell. 253 
Now turn the system of knowledge 254 Into light--- 255 
Parents and masters begin, begin schoolmasters 256 At Cadameys and 
Collegeys, 257 Begin ministers, 258 Leave off, scarecrows in courage, 
259 Brave good apelets--- 260 One thing masters must teach: 
261 Have good manners 262 To parents and people in 
streets, 263 And don't be too nosey. 264 I recommend 
a school 12 265 Of languages, 266 Scholars to go 
to 267 Far parts to trade--- 268 Go supercargo 269 
To learn navigation 270 And character. 271 There will in 
time take 272 Many brave men, 273 Advantage to merchants 
274 And funding to country--- 275 Wise men pos-pos on 
this. 276 Goodby---Timothy Dexter. 277 I command peace and the 
278 Gratest brotherly love 279 And Not fade, be linked 
280 Together with that best of troue Love 281 So 
as to govern all nasions 282 On the fass of 
the gloub 283 Not to 284 Tiranize over them 13 
285 But to 286 Put them to order ... 287

of the gout, and being 320 A little sober in 
the morning 321 I raised in the garden a Temple 
of Reason 322 For my own funeral, 323 Furnished with 
pipes and tobacco, a speaking trumpet 324 And fireworks in 
the tomb, 325 A Bible to read, and some good 
songs. 326 I sent out invitations. 327 Now it was 
time to begin. 15 328 It was a fine clear 
day, 329 I had fine pallbearers 330 Lord East Lord 
West Lord North and Lord South 331 Lord Megul and 
Lord Shambow. 332 The minister made his prayer--- 333 Doctor 
Strong, he was--- 334 And the flimsy sextons were there 
335 And very much crying. 336 About 3000 came, 337 
Oh, half the town, I'd say. 338 The procession wound 
16 339 Under my window 340 Across the garden to 
my 341 Temple of Reason. 342 My coffin was long 
ready, 343 Painted in my house. 344 White lead inside 
345 And outside touched with green. 346 Noble trimmings, eight 
handles 347 And an uncommon lock. 348 Now it was 
put into the 349 Temple of Reason. 350 Out in 
the kitchen I was 351 Beating my wife; 352 The 
ghostly lady 353 Had hardly mourned at all. 354 Very 
few people 355 Should attend funerals. 356 Many catch cold, 
and we 357 Want to settle Ohio; 358 We can't 
spare these beauties 359 To die so soon.217 I will 
say what I mean here; in a book; 218 I 
wants to make 219 My Enemies grin 220 Like a 
cat over 221 A hot puddin. 222 If you can 
bear the truth 10 223 Then I will tell the 
truth: 224 Man's the best animal, 225 And the worst--- 
226 All men, I say, are more or 227 Less 
the Devil's. 228 Odds make the difference 229 And there's 
a sight of odds. 230 Some half, some quarters. 231 
Odds make the difference. 232 I see in all places 
God, the God 233 Of nature in all things. 234 
We live and move in God, 235 We live in 
God. 236 When great powers ruled, 237 I was born.
