1 In wet green midspring, midnight and the wind 2 
floodladen and ground-wet, and the immense dry moon. 3 Mrs. 
Walpurga under neon saw 4 the fluid airs stream over 
fluid evening, 5 ground, memory, give way and rivers run 
6 into her sticky obsessive kiss of branches, 7 kiss 
of a real and visionary mouth, 8 the moon, the 
mountain, the round breast's sleepless eye. 9 Shapes of her 
fantasy in music from the bars, 10 swarming like juke-box 
lights the avenues; 11 no longer parked in the forest, 
from these cars, 12 these velvet rooms and wooden tourist 
camps, 13 sheetless under the naked white of the moon. 
14 Wet gaze of eye, plum-color shadow and young 15 
streams of these mouths, the streaming surface of earth 16 
flowing alive with water, the egg and its becoming. 17 
Coming in silence. The shapes of every dread 18 seducing 
the isolated will. They do not care. 19 They are 
not tortured, not tired, not alone. 20 They break to 
an arm, a leg, half of a mouth, 21 kissing 
disintegrate, flow whole, couple again; 22 she is changed along, 
she is a stream in a stream. 23 These are 
her endless years, woman and child, in dream 24 molded 
and wet, a bowl growing on a wheel, 25 not 
mud, not bowl, not clay, but this becoming, 26 winter 
and split of darkness, years of wish. 27 To want 
these couples, want these coupling pairs, 28 emblems of many 
parents, of the bed, 29 of love divided by dream, 
love with his dead wife, 30 love with her husband 
dead, love with his living love. 31 Mrs. Walpurga cries 
out : "It is not true!" 32 The light shifts, 
flowing away. "It was never like---" 33 She stops, but 
nothing stops. It moves. It moves. 34 And not like 
anything. And it is true. 35 The shapes disfigure. Here 
is the feature man, 36 not whole, he is detail, 
he gleams and goes. 37 Here is the woman all 
cloth, black velvet face, 38 black, head to ground, close 
black fit to the skin, 39 slashed at the mouth 
and eyes, slashed at the breasts, 40 slashed at the 
triangle, showing rose everywhere. 41 Nights are disturbed, here is 
a crying river 42 running through years, here is the 
flight among 43 all the Objects of Love. This wish, 
this gesture 44 irresisted, immortal seduction! The young sea 45 
streams over the land of dream, and there 46 the 
mountain like a mist-flower, the dark upright peak. 47 And 
over the sheet-flood Mrs. Walpurga 48 in whitened cycles of 
her changing moon. 49 The silence and the music change; 
this song 50 rises and sharps, and never quite can 
scream--- 51 but this is laughter harsher than nakedness 52 
can take---in the shady shady grove the leaves 53 move 
over, the men and women move and part, 54 the 
river braids and unfolds in mingling song; 55 and here 
is the rain of summer from the moon, 56 relenting, 
wet, and giving life at last, 57 and Mrs. Walpurga 
and we may wake.
