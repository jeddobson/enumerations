1 For the first time today 2 I see for 
the first time 3 Throwing myself away 4 Into the 
flood of chance. 5 Falling, meet the dark flame 6 
Over America, 7 There is a lie in the curse 
8 Of the fall of man. 9 I know the 
shaking doom 10 With doom the only sure. 11 Earth 
rushing up at my eyes 12 With the speed of 
fear. 13 Possibility. 14 My fingers do their work. 15 
Fallen into a trap, 16 I hang and drink the 
black 17 Drink of shock, I swing 18 From lack 
of frame to frame, 19 And toward myself I swing 
20 Slowly becoming man 21 Among all things, a knot 
22 Of possibility, 23 A man among meanings 24 Swinging 
down the sky. 25 Now I remember love 26 I 
remember time 27 I do not deny surrender 28 Nor 
the womb. 29 Begun again, I praise 30 The faIl 
for being sure, 31 May I faIl whole and perceiving 
32 On the arisen shore.
