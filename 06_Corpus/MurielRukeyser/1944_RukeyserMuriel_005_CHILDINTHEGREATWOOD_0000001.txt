1 It is all much worse than I dreamed. 2 
The trees are all here, 3 Trunk, limb, and leaf, 
4 Nothing beyond belief 5 In danger's atmosphere 6 And 
the underbrush is cursed. 7 But the animals, 8 Some 
are as I have dreamed, 9 Appear and do their 
worst 10 Until more animals 11 With recognizable faces 12 
Arrive and take their places 13 And do their worst. 
14 It is all a little like dreaming, 15 But 
this forest is silent, 16 This acts out anxiety 17 
In a midnight stillness. 18 My blood that sparkles in 
me 19 Cannot endure this voiceless 20 Forest, this is 
not sleep 21 Not peace but a lack of words. 
22 And the mechanical birds 23 Wing, claw, and sharpened 
eye. 24 I cannot see their sky. 25 Even this 
war is not unlike the dream, 26 But in the 
dream-war there were armies, 27 Armies and armor and death's 
etiquette, 28 Here there are no troops and no protection, 
29 Only this wrestling of the heart 30 And a 
demon-song that goes 31 For sensual friction 32 Is largely 
fiction 33 And partly fact 34 And so is tact 
35 And so is love, 36 And so is love. 
37 The thin leaves chatter. There is a sound at 
last 38 Begun at last by the demon-song. 39 Behind 
the wildest trees I see the men together 40 Confessing 
their lives and the women together. 41 But really I 
cannot hear the words. I cannot hear the song. 42 
This may still be my dream 43 But the night 
seems very long.
