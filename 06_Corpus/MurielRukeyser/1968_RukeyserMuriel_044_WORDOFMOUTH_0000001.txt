1 Westward from SÃ¨te 2 as I went long before 
3 along my life 4 as I went 5 wave 
by wave--- 6 the long words of the sea 7 
the orange rooftop tiles 8 back to the boundary 9 
where I had been before. 10 Spain. 11 Sex of 
cactus and of cypresses, 12 Tile-orange, green; olive; black. The 
sea. 13 One man. Beethoven radio. War. 14 Threat of 
all life. Within my belief's body. 15 Within my morning, 
music. High colored mountain 16 along the seacoast 17 where 
the swallows fly. 18 Prolonged 19 beyond your cries and 
your cities. 20 Along my life and death backward toward 
that morning 21 when all things fell open and I 
went into Spain. 22 One man. Sardana music. This frontier. 
23 Where I now come again. 24 I stop. 25 
I do not pass. 26 Wave under wave 27 like 
the divisive South 28 afire in the country of my 
birth. 29 A moment of glass. All down the coast 
I face 30 as far as vision, blue, memory of 
blue. 31 Seen now. Why do I not go in? 
I stand. 32 I cannot pass. History, destroyed music. 33 
I need to go into. 34 In a dream I 
have seen 35 Spain, sleeping children: 36 before me: 37 
as I drive 38 as I go 39 (I need 
to go into 40 this country 41 of love and) 
42 wave after wave 43 they lie 44 in a 
deep forest. 45 As the driving light 46 touches them 
47 (I need this country 48 of love and death) 
49 they begin to rouse. 50 They wake.51 Speeding back 
from the border. 52 A rock came spinning up 53 
cast from the wheels of a car. 54 Crackled the 
windshield glass. 55 Glitter before my eyes like a man 
made of snow 56 lying over the hood, blind white 
except for glints 57 an inch of sight where Languedoc 
shines through. 58 You on my one side, you on 
the other! 59 What I have is dazzle. My son; 
my friend; 60 tell me this side and tell me 
that side, 61 news of the road near Agde. 62 
Word from this side, word from the tree-side--- 63 Spain 
at our back : agony : before me, glitter, 64 
today 65 blinding my eyes, blind diamonds, one clear wound. 
66 Something is flying out of the sky behind me. 
67 Turning, stirring of dream, something is speeding, 68 something 
is overtaking. 69 Stirrings in prisons, on beds, the mouths 
of the young, 70 resist, dance, love. It drives through 
the back of my head, 71 through my eyes and 
breasts and mouth. 72 I know a harvest : mass 
in the wine country. 73 A lifetime after, and still 
alive. 74 Something out of Spain, into the general light! 
75 I drive blind white, trusting news of this side, 
76 news of that side, all the time the line 
of the poem: 77 Amor, pena, desig, somni, dolor. 78 
The grapes have become wine by the hand of man. 
79 Sea risen from the sea, a bearded king. 80 
The seaward cemetery risen from the sea 81 like a 
woman rising. 82 Amor. 83 Phases of sun. 84 The 
wine declared god by the hand of man. 85 Pena. 
86 A rumor given me by this side and that 
side. 87 We drive in brilliant glitter, in jungle night, 
in distant war, 88 in all our cities, in a 
word, overtaking. 89 Desig. 90 A cry received, gone past 
me into all men, 91 speaking, into all women. 92 
A man goes into the sea, 93 bearded fire and 
all things rise from this blaze of eyes, 94 living, 
it speaks, driving forth from Spain, 95 somni, dolor, 96 
These cliffs, these years. Do we drive into light? 97 
Driven, live, overtaken? 98 Amor, pena, desig.
