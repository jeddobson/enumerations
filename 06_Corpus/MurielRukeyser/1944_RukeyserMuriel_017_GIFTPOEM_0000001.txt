1 The year in its cold beginning 2 Promises more 
than cold; 3 The old contrary rhyming 4 Will never 
again hold--- 5 The great moon in its timing 6 
Making the empty sky 7 A continent of light 8 
Creates fine bombing weather, 9 Assures a safer flight 10 
For fliers, and many will die 11 Who in their 
backwardness 12 Cannot leave the ground. 13 Weather is not 
what it was: 14 The losers are not winning, 15 
The lost will never be found. 16 The year in 
its cold beginning 17 Finds us a good deal farther 
18 From our good weather 19 Than we had ever 
dreamed. 20 Darling, dead words sublimed 21 May be read 
out loud at last: 22 The legendary past 23 Cannot 
scare us again. 24 This is what I have known 
25 After a New Year's Eve 26 Of a desperate 
time. 27 There will be great sorrow, 28 Great pain, 
and detailed joy, 29 The gladness of flowering 30 Minutes, 
green living leaf. 31 You recommend me grief: 32 There 
will be no more grief; 33 Terrible battle that tears 
the world apart, 34 Terrible health that takes the world 
to bed, 35 Sickness that, broken, jets across the room 
36 Into the future time; 37 Not the mild ways 
of grief, 38 Mourning that feels at home. 39 I 
see your gardens from here, 40 I see on your 
terraces 41 The shadowy awful regiment; 42 The weak man, 
the impossible man, 43 The curly-headed impotent 44 Whose failure 
did not reach his face, 45 And then the struggle 
for grace, and then 46 The school'd attenuated men. 47 
I know you are moved by these: 48 The vice 
of self-desire 49 That does not lead to crime, 50 
Leads to no action, is rather 51 Liquid seductive fire 
52 Before the final blame 53 When there is no 
forgiveness. 54 And many lovers fail to love, 55 Lose 
the ability to move 56 Before the supernatural fear 57 
Calls to the natural need 58 Come to the feast 
and feed 59 On a supernatural meal: 60 The taproot 
and the sacrifice. 61 Nothing can arrive to heal 62 
The dead wish, the living face 63 That sees its 
disgrace and loss, 64 But the loss of its dear 
wish: 65 The word spoken across 66 Distance and loneliness--- 
67 Communication to the flesh. 68 There will be small 
joy: 69 There will be great rage, 70 Do not 
tell me the feeble 71 Grief of the very weak; 
72 Only turn, only speak. 73 I see all the 
possible ends. 74 But the impossible; 75 I know it 
in its weakness, 76 Unborn and unprized, 77 It still 
commands my faith. 78 And then I remember the page 
79 Of other words for death. 80 Then I remember 
the voices, 81 The voice not recognized 82 Or overheard 
too soon; 83 Rejected offerings, 84 Letter and telephone, 85 
And I think of the bombing weather 86 Fine in 
the full of the moon. 87 I think of the 
big moon 88 Plain on the gardens, 89 And the 
clews of the year. 90 The haunted gardens wear it, 
91 Knowledge like furniture; 92 The white frame of the 
spirit 93 Whose painting is naked fear. 94 The girl 
whose father raped her first 95 Should have used a 
little knife; 96 Failing that, her touch is cursed 97 
By the omissive sin for life; 98 This bitter year's 
event and change 99 Turned to personal revenge. 100 Paint 
out the tortured painting, 101 The scene is too well 
done 102 But this processional 103 Must find some other 
saint, 104 Must find some other colors, 105 Some better 
expiation 106 Even more strange. 107 Murder is not the 
link; 108 Meaning must set it right. 109 Never recommend 
me grief 110 Nor deny my horror's straightness, 111 Early 
and late I see 112 The fire in the leaf 
113 The minute's appetite. 114 If horror fire and change 
115 Bring us our success 116 The word is indeed 
lost--- 117 If the frosty world 118 Start its newest 
year 119 In fear and loss and belief, 120 Something 
may yet be safe. 121 Joy may touch the eyes 
again, 122 Night restore the walls of sleep, 123 Ease 
the will's incessant strain 124 And the forehead and the 
breast 125 And the lung where death lies sleeping. 126 
Darling, if there should be tears, 127 They'll be no 
easy movie weeping, 128 Never the soft tears of grief 
129 That go as simply as they start; 130 The 
rage and horror of the heart 131 In conflict with 
its love. January 1941
