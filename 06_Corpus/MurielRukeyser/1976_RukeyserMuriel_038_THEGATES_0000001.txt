1 Waiting to leave all day I hear the words; 
2 That poet in prison, that poet newly-died 3 whose 
words we wear, reading, all of us. I and my 
son. 4 All day we read the words: 5 friends, 
lovers, daughters, grandson, 6 and all night the distant loves 
7 and I who had never seen him am drawn 
to him 8 Through acts, through poems, 9 through our 
closenesses--- 10 whatever links us in our variousness; 11 across 
worlds, love and poems and justices 12 wishing to be 
born.13 Walking the world to find the poet of these 
cries. 14 But this walking is flying the streets of 
all the air. 15 Walking the world, through the people 
at airports, 16 this city of hills, this island ocean 
fire-blue and now this city. 17 Walking this world is 
driving the roads of houses 18 endless tiles houses, fast 
streams, now this child's house. 19 Walking under the sharp 
mountains through the sharp city 20 circled in time by 
rulers, their grip; the marvelous 21 hard-gripped people silent among 
their rulers, looking at me.22 The new friend comes into 
my hotel room 23 smiling. He does a curious thing. 
24 He walks around the room, touching 25 all the 
pictures hanging on the wall. 26 One picture does not 
move. 27 A new friend assures me : Foreigners are 
safe, 28 You speak for writers, you are safe, he 
says. 29 There will be no car 30 driving up 
behind you, there will be 31 no accident, he says. 
I know these accidents. 32 Nothing will follow you, he 
says. 33 O the Mafia at home, I know, Black 
Hand 34 of childhood, the death of Tresca whom I 
mourn, 35 the building of New York. Many I know. 
36 This morning I go early to see the Cardinal. 
37 When I return, the new friend is waiting. His 
face 38 wax-candle-pool-color, he saying 39 "I thought you were 
kidnapped." 40 A missionary comes to visit me. 41 Looks 
into my eyes. Says, 42 "Turn on the music so 
we can talk."43 The Cabinet minister speaks of liberation. 44 
"Do you know how the Communists use this word?" 45 
We all use the word. Liberation. 46 No, but look---these 
are his diaries, 47 says the Cabinet minister. 48 These 
were found in the house of the poet. 49 Look, 
Liberation, Liberation, he is speaking in praise. 50 He says, 
this poet, It is not wrong 51 to take from 
the rich and give to the poor. 52 Yes. He 
says it in prose speech, he says it in his 
plays, 53 he says it in his poems that bind 
me to him, 54 that bind his people and mine 
in these new ways 55 for the first time past 
strangeness and despisal. 56 It also means that you broke 
into his house and stole his 57 papers.58 Among the 
days, 59 among the nights of the poet in solitary, 
60 a strong infant is just beginning to run. 61 
I go up the stepping-stones 62 to where the young 
wife of the poet 63 stands holding the infant in 
her arms. 64 She weeps, she weeps. 65 But the 
poet's son looks at me 66 and the wife's mother 
looks at me with a keen look 67 across her 
grief. Lights in the house, books making every wall 68 
a wall of speech. 69 The clasp of the woman's 
hand 70 around my wrist, a keen band 71 more 
steel than the words 72 Save his life. 73 I 
feel that clasp on my bones. 74 A strong infant 
is beginning to run.75 As we climb to the church 
of Galilee 76 Three harsh men on the corner. 77 
As we go to the worship-meeting of the dismissed, 78 
three state police on the street. 79 As we all 
join at the place of the dispossessed, 80 three dark 
men asking their rote questions. 81 As we go ahead 
to stand with our new friends 82 that will be 
our friends our lifetime. 83 Introduced as dismissed from this 
faculty, this college, 84 this faculty, this university. 85 'Dismissed' 
is now an honorary degree. 86 The harsh police are 
everywhere, 87 they have hunted this fellowship away before 88 
and they are everywhere, at the street-corner, 89 listening to 
all hymns, 90 standing before all doors, 91 hearing over 
all wires. 92 We go up to Galilee. 93 Let 
them listen to the dispossessed 94 and to all women 
and men who stand firm and sing 95 wanting a 
shared and honest lifetime. 96 Let them listen to Galilee.97 
That night, a flute 98 across the dark, the sound 
99 opening times to me, a time 100 when I 
stood on the green hillside 101 before the great white 
stone. 102 Grave of my ancestor 103 Akiba at rest 
over Kinneret. 104 The holy poem, he said to me, 
105 the Song of Songs always; 106 and know what 
I know, to love 107 your belief with all your 
life, 108 and resist the Romans, as I did, 109 
even to the torture and beyond. 110 Over Kinneret, with 
all of them, 111 Jesus, all the Judeans, 112 that 
other Galilee 113 in dream across war I see.114 Woman 
seen as a slender instrument, 115 woman at vigil in 
the prison-yard, 116 woman seen as the fine tines of 
a pitchfork 117 that works hard, that is worn down, 
rusted down 118 to a fine sculpture standing in a 
yard 119 where her son's body is confined. 120 Woman 
as fine tines blazing against sunset, 121 wavering lines against 
yellow brightness 122 where her fine body becomes transparent in 
bravery, 123 where she will live and die as the 
tines of a pitchfork 124 that stands to us as 
her son's voice does stand 125 across the world speaking 
126 The rumor comes that if this son is killed
