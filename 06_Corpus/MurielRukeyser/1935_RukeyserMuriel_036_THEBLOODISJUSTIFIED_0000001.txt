1 Beat out continuance in the choking veins 2 before 
emotion betrays us, and we find 3 staring behind our 
faces, accomplices of death. 4 Not to die, but slowly 
to validate our lives : 5 simply to move, lightly 
burdened, alone, 6 carrying in this brain survival, carrying 7 
within these ribs, history, 8 the past deep in the 
bone. 9 Unthread time till its empty needle prick your 
flesh 10 sewing your scars with air, treating the wounds 
11 only by laceration and the blood is fresh 12 
blood on our skin on our lips over our eyes. 
13 Living they move on a canvas of centuries 14 
restored from death in artful poses, found 15 once more 
by us, descendants, foraging, 16 ravelling time back over American 
ground. 17 How did they wish, grandparents of these wars, 
18 what cataracts of ambition fell across their brains? : 
19 The heavy boots kicked stones down Wisconsin roads, 20 
Augusta Coller danced her d√©but at Oshkosh : 21 they 
spoke these names : Milwaukee, Waukesha, 22 the crackle and 
drawl of Indian strange words. 23 Jungle-savage the south 24 
raw green and shining branches, the crying 25 of parakeets, 
the pointed stone, 26 the altars stained with oil : 
27 Mexico : and Canada wheaten and polar with 28 
snow halfway up the sky : 29 all these unknown. 
30 : What treason to their race has fathered us? 
31 They walked in the towns, the men selling clothing 
etc. 32 the women tatting and boiling down grape jelly. 
33 : If they were asked this, surely they did 
not answer. 34 Over the country, Wisconsin, Chicago, Yonkers, 35 
I was begotten, American branch no less because 36 I 
call on the great names of other countries. 37 I 
do not say : Forgive, to my kindred dead, 38 
only : Understand my treason, See I betray you kissing, 
39 I overthrow your milestones weeping among your tombs. 40 
From out your knowing eyes I sprang, child of your 
distant wombs, 41 of your full lips. Speaking allegiance, I 
turn, 42 steadfastly to destroy your hope. Your cargo in 
me 43 swings to ports hostile to your old intent. 
44 In us recurrences. : My generation feeds 45 the 
wise assault on your anticipation, 46 repeating historic sunderings, betraying 
our fathers, 47 all parricidal in our destinies. 48 How 
much are we American? Not knowing 49 these other lands, 
being 50 blood wrung from your bone, our pioneers, 51 
we call kindred to you, we claim links, speaking 52 
your tongue, although we pass, shaking 53 your dream with 
revolution since we must. 54 By these roads shall we 
come upon our country. 55 Pillowed upon this birthright, we 
may wake 56 strong for such treason, brave with your 
fallen dust. 57 O, we are afflicted with these present 
evils, 58 they press between the mirror and our eyes, 
59 obscuring your loaned mouths and borrowed hair. 60 We 
focus on our times, destroying you, fathers 61 in the 
long ground : you have given strange birth 62 to 
us who turn against you in our blood 63 needing 
to move in our integrity, accomplices 64 of life in 
revolution, though the past 65 be sweet with your tall 
shadows, and although 66 we turn from treasons, we shall 
accomplish these.
