1 The sky behind the farthest shore 2 Is darker 
than I go to sleep. 3 Blackness of water, the 
crater at the core, 4 The many blacknesses begin to 
gleam. 5 Rivers of darkness bind me to this land 
6 While overhead the moon goes far to shine, 7 
And now nothing nobody is my own. 8 The motion 
of streams glitters before my eyes: 9 Sources and entrances, 
they lie no more, 10 Now darkly keep, now flow 
now bright 11 Until all wandering end, a hand 12 
Shine, and the leadings homeward of delight 13 Seem to 
begin my deepest sleep 14 To make a lake of 
dream.
