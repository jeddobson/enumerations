1 Whipping the face. Europe, with all her winds. 2 
Shore-wind of despair and beginnings. The big guns. 3 Whose 
word is the shape of storm. Who offer choice 4 
Only of death or growth. 5 Either a man is 
a visitor in hell 6 Or his shoulders become a 
coast of images: 7 Fireflood twisting the girders and nave 
of things 8 To leave the scars and the spire. 
9 Receding, sees the traveler and the hill 10 Facing 
each other in a world of meaning. 11 Everything else 
carried its own destruction, 12 And now again is beginning 
to be born. 13 The docks and the steel towns 
and the shadow plants 14 Reflect our forms of hope; 
a man's a visitor 15 Between the whistling crests of 
storm. 16 Storm breaks, 17 And he in conflict remembers 
Eden, not dream, 18 Not womb, not garden, but city 
of God 19 City being the form of our wishes 
for each other, 20 That burn in cities throughout the 
human night 21 Tonight, only a few miles apart. 22 
The chain of lifetimes burning locks his life 23 To 
the arm of the jetty stretched into the sea. 24 
To the credence of definite objects, doorsills, nails driven in, 
25 The zone of silence, meaning explosion, 26 Or Liverpool 
and Auntie Lizzie McHeice, 27 A bottle of beer and 
a notable buttonhole. 28 The bricks and the spillways of 
fire, 29 The pilgrim of surfaces knows these appetites 30 
Deep in the split race of his roots of dream. 
31 He lies down here to bury his old self. 
32 It will restore his earth as fire never can, 
33 Nor blood. There is no other sacrifice 34 Beyond 
commitment, where the terms are born, 35 Where giving is 
taking, where all feeds on all 36 In the human 
process. When he wakes 37 He will venture out into 
the same besieged 38 City but smell a difference in 
the singe 39 And the air's change. He will be 
horrified 40 To hear himself use the phrases of the 
other country. 41 He will look for the fine relations 
even in his own words. 42 He will recall, even 
in death, even in dream, even in his 43 sharpest-focused 
joy 44 The full birth in its wild simplicities. 45 
He was standing on the jetty at Hell's Corner, 46 
Rings of desire for Europe, no, America, no, the limitless 
spirit 47 of the born and unborn 48 Fall over 
his head. 49 And at his back there is nothing 
but the future.
