for Marya Zaturenska 1 And for the man with one 
nightmare, the student of clouds, 2 the bitter 3 hero 
whose silly laurels, kept on his head, confess he knows 
his 4 Brutus, 5 the tall political speaker, alone on 
his platform, the wooden 6 echoes, the batter 7 words, 
who wishes he could sail in the middle of the 
ocean, 8 and never move at all, 9 for all 
those who freeze alone in the middle of madness, of 
10 sleep, of the better 11 madness of speed, hands 
frozen to the frozen steering-wheel, a 12 circuit of cold 
coming 13 around through their lives, their current of loneliness, 
I tell of 14 the single face; 15 a windowpane, 
two stains where eyes should stammer; 16 the head in 
the barber-chair, nothing behind it but hands; 17 ghosts, boat-burial, 
a headless coat on the dancing clothesline. 18 A shouting 
single dream of alone, 19 or the islanded paranoiac insisting 
20 my dear dear dear dear dear dear dear 21 
my dear my dear dear. 22 The one dream spoken, 
or the bird more alone, 23 rising to spill that 
lake, his music, over 24 repeated cities whose ragmen crowd 
the docks 25 staring at scraps, whose brutes, whose chinless 
villains 26 under the flag speak to their crowds 27 
alone, howling; alone, falling; alone and alone among 28 all 
the anonymous who work and meet and scatter 29 and 
write the criminal words, "Burn this," under the letter. 30 
And the pillars of the cities with their poor against 
them, 31 the men in the sky, riding the cylinder 
hung on hero chains, 32 the men in the airlock, 
waiting; in the subway, sitting 33 at puzzles and headlines, 
waiting. 34 And always these figures with the averted face. 
35 Winter advancing, the white, the witless season, 36 and 
the spirit waiting. 37 The cold comes fast, an appetite 
of air--- 38 earth-eating serpent, my Faust, swallowing 39 the 
alone and the falling and the howls of day. 40 
The core is in the head, five-fingered wrong 41 throws 
a switch in the head; loneliness, fear, 42 the deaf 
indifferent suicide seeking the water, 43 abnormal batters who will 
not hit the ball, 44 magicians imagining rack and oubliette; 
45 the athlete owning his gun; the priest his persecution, 
46 the speaker his curse; the uniform its muscle. 47 
But I remember I am hands and whole, 48 head, 
breasts, and white, and to be used. 49 Only those 
passed through madness have any sense for us, 50 whose 
eyes say I have seen, whose mouths read I have 
been 51 there. 52 Alone and waiting cold so long. 
53 Race up, race up, you fiery man. 54 He 
does not try; he dares not; or caring, cannot cure. 
55 When song is insecure, again 56 the solo lark 
goes mad for song.
