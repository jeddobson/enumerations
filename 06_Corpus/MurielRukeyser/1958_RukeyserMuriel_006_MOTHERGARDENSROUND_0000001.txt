1 The year was river-throated, with the stare of legend, 
2 Then truth the whirlwind and Mother Garden. Death. 3 
And now these stars, antlers, the masks of speech, 4 
And the one ghost a glove in the middle of 
the floor. 5 Garden my green may grow. 6 If 
you were here tonight, my heart would rest, 7 Would 
rest on a support, happy thereon. 8 Something is dancing 
on leafdrift, dancing across the graves: 9 A child is 
watching while the world breaks open. 10 Garden my green 
may grow. 11 Speed of a red fox running along 
this street. 12 Everyone could have seen it, no one 
is now awake. 13 Separations all year and the seeking 
of roots. 14 It was a lie, Mother Garden, they 
do not wish for death. 15 Garden my green may 
grow. 16 They wish only to live again. No more 
the whirlwind. 17 One colored pebble now, one look, the 
singular 18 Opening of the lips; a leaf happens to 
speak. 19 I remember in love you walked to me 
straight across that 20 room. 21 Garden my green may 
grow. 22 The suffering of your absence flies around me 
now, 23 No house can keep out this flying of 
small birds. 24 Feathers, bird-feathers, settle upon my waking. 25 
The agonies are open. Faces, dead within them; and on 
these 26 faces 27 And filling the clefts and on 
my hands and eyes 28 The little fresh pain flutters. 
Whitening the grass, 29 Snowing through the windows. Drifting over 
the floor. 30 Touching my face when, almost, touch means 
kindness. 31 My dear dream, Mother Garden. We wish to 
be born again. 32 Death death may my green grow.
