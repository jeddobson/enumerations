1 Where are they, not those young men, not those 
2 young women 3 Who walked among the bullet-headed Romans 
with their 4 roads, their symmetry, their iron rule--- 5 
We know the dust and bones they are gone to, 
those 6 young Romans 7 Who stood against the bitter 
imperial, their young 8 green life with its poems--- 9 
Where are the poems made music against the purple 10 
Setting their own purple up for a living sign, 11 
Bright fire of some forgotten future against empire, 12 Their 
poems in the beautiful Roman tongue 13 Sex-songs, love-poems, freedom-songs? 
14 Not only the young, but the old and in 
chains, 15 The slaves in their singing, the fierce northern 
16 gentle blond rhythms, 17 The Judean cantillations, lullabies of 
Carthage, 18 Gaul with her cries, all the young Roman 
rebels, 19 Where are their songs? Who will unlock them, 
20 Who will find them for us, in some undiscovered 
21 painted cave 22 For we need you, sisters, far 
brothers, poems 23 of our lost Rome.
