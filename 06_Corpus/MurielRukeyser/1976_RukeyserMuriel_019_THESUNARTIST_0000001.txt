1 The opening of the doors. Dark. 2 The opening 
of the large doors. 3 Out of the daylight and 
the scent of trees 4 and that lake where generations 
of swans 5 no longer move among children. In a 
poisoned time. 6 But the bright-headed children move. 7 Dark, 
high, the beams of a huge building 8 exposed in 
the high dark air. 9 I see brightness with a 
shock of joy.10 Past the darkness a lashing of color. 
11 Not color, strands of light. 12 Not light but 
pure deep color beyond color, 13 like the pure fierce 
light I once knew, before 14 a minute of blindness. 
These colors are deeper; 15 the entire range in its 
millions, 16 twisting and brilliant traveling.17 I stand in the 
strong sun before a bank of prisms. 18 On the 
screen in front of me, tangled colors of light, 19 
twined, intertwined. 20 A sensitive web of light changing, for 
the sun moves, the air 21 moves. 22 The perceiver 
moves. 23 I dance my slow dance.24 The deepest blue, 
green, not the streams of the sea, 25 the clear 
yellow of yellows, not California, more, 26 not Mediterranean, not 
the Judean steeps. Red beyond 27 blood over flame, 28 
more even than visionary America. All light. 29 A man 
braced on the sun, where the sun enters 30 through 
the roof, where the sun-follower, 31 a man-made motor with 
a gentle motion 32 just counters the movement of the 
earth, holds this scene 33 in front of us on 
the man-made screen. 34 Light traveling, meets, leaps and becomes 
art.35 Colors move on a screen. The doors open again. 
36 They run in, the California children. 37 They run 
past the colors and the colors change. 38 The laughter 
of running. They cry out, bird-voices, 39 ninety-seven children, Wow! 
Wow! How come?40 Another day. I stand before the screen, 
41 Alone I move, selecting out my green, 42 choose 
out the red with my arm, I let the orange 
stand, 43 a web of yellow, the blue stays and 
shines. 44 I am part of the color, I am 
part of the sun.45 You have made an art in 
which the sun is standing. 46 It changes, goes dark, 
goes grey. The sun appears. 47 You have led me 
through eleven states of being. 48 You have invited us 
all. Allow the sunlight, 49 dance your dance,50 Another day. 
No sun. The fog is down, 51 Doing its slow 
dance into the city, 52 It enters the Gate and 
my waking. 53 There will be no colors but the 
range of white. 54 Before the screen, I wait.55 Night. 
What do you know about the light?56 Waiting. A good 
deal like real life. 57 Waiting before the sea for 
the fish to run 58 Waiting before the paper for 
the poem 59 Waiting for a man's life to be, 
to be.60 Break of light! Sun in his colors, 61 
streaming into our lives. 62 This artist dreams of the 
sun, the sun, the children of the sun.63 Frail it 
is and can be intercepted. 64 Fragile, like ourselves. Mirrors 
and prisms, they 65 can be broken. 66 Children shattered 
by anything. 67 Strong, pouring strong, wild as the power 
of the great sun. 68 Not art, but light. In 
distance, in smiting winter, 69 the artist speaks : No 
art. 70 This is not art. 71 What is an 
artist? I bear the song of the sun.
