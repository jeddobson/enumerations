1 In a summer forest, when the profuse season 2 
Let fall as burning flowers the burning flowers. 3 The 
cities of Europe fall as people chopped down and dying. 
4 The skies see hairy fire. The children see 5 
Their mothers opening as nobody had told them 6 People 
can open. News sometimes comes of Father. 7 Then no 
longer. What horror the children see 8 Will not be 
acted out upon the world 9 For fifty years, or 
a hundred, as horror bursting 10 Or anti-horror working in 
their children. 11 A neat correctly dressed man with a 
picnic smile 12 Is drawing his feet up under him 
in a dance 13 In the summer forest. He makes 
a little stamping 14 Pulling his knees up, a shiny 
little dance 15 Called Hitler Jigging. The Forest of Compi√®gne. 
16 The beds and chimneys and toys and linen and 
wood 17 Of many houses are not interested in this 
dance 18 And in China they have been fighting for 
a long time 19 Dragging thousands of miles the idea 
of man. 20 What were his dreams during these nights? 
Unknown.
