1 When this hand is gone to earth, 2 this 
writing hand and the paper beneath it, 3 long gone, 
and the words on the paper forgotten, 4 and the 
breath that slowly curls around earth with 5 its old 
spoken words 6 gone into lives unborn and they too 
gone to earth--- 7 and their memory, memory of any 
of these gone, 8 and all who remembered them absorbed 
in air and dirt, 9 words, earth, breeze over the 
oceans, all these now other, 10 there may as in 
the past be something left, 11 some artifact. This pen. 
Will it tell my? Will it tell our? 12 This 
thing made in bright metal by thousands unknown to me, 
13 will it arrive with that unnameable wish to speak 
a music, 14 offering something out of all I moved 
among? 15 singing for others unknown a long-gone moment in 
old time 16 sung? 17 The pen--- 18 will some 
broken pieces be assembled by women, by guessing 19 men 
20 (or future mutations, beings unnamed by us)--- 21 can 
these dry pieces join? Again go bright? Speak to you 
22 then?
