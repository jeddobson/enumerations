1 The choice proposed : ascends, the nervy conductor 2 
facing the strings as the stage shakes, as the plane 
3 looms in the loud air, motor cut out, 4 
and the musicians' black alters to violin-brown. 5 They lift 
their instruments. The choice. 6 Mr. Sceptre, the elegant instructor, 
7 looks about the classroom sighing Keats, 8 emotion in 
torrents on adolescent cheeks 9 as teargas tranquilly saturates the 
college. 10 Choose: the workers will rise, or your heroes, 
tall as stone, 11 must face the fascist cruelties of 
pain. 12 Trapped in the valley---historian eloquence 13 reminds us 
of recurrent Civil War: 14 "To prevent repetition of this 
attack of the enemy 15 I directed Captain Gaw, chief 
topographer, 16 to reach the commanding officer of the other 
wing." 17 "Obtained abundance of corn, molasses, and sweet potatoes." 
18 "The advance was then gallantly resumed, the enemy 19 
driven from their guns, the heights handsomely carried." 20 But 
the choice is proposed: the active alternative, 21 people's Party 
in the streets, last year's heroes at home. 22 Who 
will take choice, demands the scientist 23 (the smiling friend 
sitting beside his mind), 24 now that the key is 
grincing in the lock? 25 Now that the sea has 
bitten on the ship 26 and bent it to the 
rock? 27 Here are insignia of reversed cities, 28 victorious 
slogans and the acts of war. 29 And we shall 
never know their poise again, 30 though we remember what 
we were, 31 now that our officers are no longer 
32 in full golden summer regalia, 33 and we no 
longer well-dressed watchers 34 at the march-past and the fly-by--- 
35 or even attentive before the fire 36 haunted by 
certain safe compelling shoulders, 37 a trick of the head, 
lust of incautious eye; 38 fortified by the braver faces 
39 of picket-line and commemorative parade, 40 the anniversary demonstration--- 
41 we cast about for love, lost between wars, 42 
alone in the room and every street-light out. 43 Who's 
to rise to it, now that ruin's made, 44 now 
that we're petrified in the pale looking-glass, 45 our glossy 
scars, our books, our loss, 46 caught in the narrowest 
final pass? 47 And all our heroes are afraid.
