1 The randy old 2 woman said 3 Tickle me 
up 4 I'll be 5 dead very soon--- 6 Nothing 
will 7 touch me then 8 but the clouds 9 
of the sky 10 and the bone- 11 white light 
12 of the moon 13 Touch me 14 before I 
go 15 down 16 among the bones 17 My dear 
one 18 alone 19 to the night --- 20 I 
said 21 I know I know 22 But all I 
know 23 tonight 24 Is that the sun 25 and 
the moon 26 they burn 27 with the one 28 
one light. 29 In her burning 30 signing 31 what 
does the 32 white moon say? 33 The moon says 
34 The sun 35 is shining.
