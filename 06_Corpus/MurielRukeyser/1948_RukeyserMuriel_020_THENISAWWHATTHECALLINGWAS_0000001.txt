1 All the voices of the wood called "Muriel!" 2 
but it was soon solved; it was nothing, it was 
not for me. 3 The words were a little like 
Mortal and More and Endure 4 and a word like 
Real, a sound like Health or Hell. 5 Then I 
saw what the calling was : it was the road 
I traveled, 6 the clear 7 time and these colors 
of orchards, gold behind gold and the full 8 shadow 
behind each tree and behind each slope. Not to me 
9 the calling, but to anyone, and at last I 
saw : where 10 the road lay through sunlight and 
many voices and the marvel 11 orchards, not for me, 
not for me, not for me. 12 I came into 
my clear being; uncalled, alive, and sure. 13 Nothing was 
speaking to me, but I offered and all was well. 
14 And then I arrived at the powerful green hill.
