1 Here are the long fields inviolate of thought, 2 
here are the planted fields raking the sky, 3 signs 
in the earth : 4 water-cast shuttles of light flickering 
the underside of rock. 5 These have been shown before; 
but the fields know new hands, 6 the son's fingers 
grasp warmly at the father's hoe ; 7 there will 
be new ways of seeing these ancestral lands. 8 "In 
town, the munitions plant has been poor since the war, 
9 And nothing but a war will make it rich 
again." 10 Holy, holy, holy, sings the church next door. 
11 Time-ridden, a man strides the current of a stream's 
flowing, 12 stands, flexing the wand curvingly over his head, 
13 tracking the water's prism with the flung line. 14 
Summer becomes productive and mature. 15 Farmers watch tools like 
spikes of doom against the sure 16 condemning sky descending 
upon the hollow lands. 17 The water is ridged in 
muscles on the rock, 18 force for the State is 
planted in the stream-bed. 19 Water springs from the stone 
--- the State is fed. 20 Morning comes, brisk with 
light, 21 a broom of color over the threshold. 22 
Long flights of shadows escape to the white sky : 
23 a spoon is straightened. Day grows. The sky is 
blued. 24 The water rushes over the shelves of stone 
25 to anti-climax on the mills below the drop. 26 
The planted fields are bright and rake the sky. 27 
Power is common. Earth is grown 28 and overgrown in 
unrelated strength, the moral 29 rehearsed already, often. 30 (There 
must be the gearing of these facts 31 into co√∂rdination, 
in a poem or numbers, 32 rows of statistics, or 
the cool iambs.) 33 The locked relationships which will be 
found 34 are a design to build these factual timbers--- 
35 a plough of thought to break this stubborn ground.
