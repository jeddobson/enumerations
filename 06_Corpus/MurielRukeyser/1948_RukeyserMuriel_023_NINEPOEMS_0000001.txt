1 The childless years alone without a home 2 Flashed 
daily with the world's glimpse, happiness. 3 Always behind was 
the dark screen of loss 4 Hardly moving, like heavy 
hardly-moving cloud. 5 "Give me myself," or "Take me," I 
said aloud; 6 There was little to give, and always 
less to take. 7 Except the promise, except the promise 
darkness 8 Makes, night and daylight, miracle to come. 9 
Flying over, I suddenly saw the traces 10 Of man 
: where man is, you may read the wind 11 
In shadow and smoke, know how the wind is gone 
12 And know the way of man; in the fall 
of the plane 13 Into its levels, encounter the ancient 
spaces : 14 The fall to life, the cliff and 
strait of bone.15 They came to me and said, "There 
is a child." 16 Fountains of images broke through my 
land. 17 My swords, my fountains spouted past my eyes 
18 And in my flesh at last I saw. Returned 
19 To when we drove in the high forest, and 
earth 20 Turned to glass in the sunset where the 
wild 21 Trees struck their roots as deep and visible 
22 As their high branches, the double planted world. 23 
"There is no father," they came and said to me. 
24 ---I have known fatherless children, the searching, walk 25 
The world, look at all faces for their father's life. 
26 Their choice is death or the world. And they 
do choose. 27 Earn their brave set of bone, the 
seeking marvelous look 28 Of those who lose and use 
and know their lives.29 There is a place. There is 
a miracle. 30 I know the nightmare, the black and 
bone piano, 31 The statues in the kitchen, a house 
dissolving in air. 32 I know the lilac-turreted cathedral 33 
Taking its roots from willows that changed before my eyes 
34 When all became real, real as the sound of 
bells. 35 We earthly are aware of transformation; 36 Miraculously, 
life, from the old despair. 37 The wave of smooth 
water approaches on the sea- 38 Surface, a live wave 
individual 39 Linking, massing its color. Moving, is struck by 
wind, 40 Ribbed, steepened, until the slope and ridge begin; 
41 Comes nearer, brightens. Now curls, its vanishing 42 Hollows 
darken and disappear; now high above 43 Me, the scroll, 
froth, foam of the overfall.44 Now the ideas all change 
to animals 45 Loping and gay, now all the images 
46 Transform to leaves, now all these screens of leaves 
47 Are flowing into rivers, I am in love 48 
With rivers, these changing waters carry voices, 49 Carry all 
children; carry all delight. 50 The water-soothed winds move warm 
above these waves. 51 The child changes and moves among 
these waves. 52 The waves are changing, they tremble from 
waves of waters 53 To other essentials --- they become 
waves of light 54 And wander through my sleep and 
through my waking, 55 And through my hands and over 
my lips and over 56 Me; brilliant and transformed and 
clear, 57 The pure light. Now I am light and 
nothing more.58 Eating sleep, eating sunlight, eating meat, 59 Lying 
in the sun to stare 60 At deliverance, the rapid 
cloud, 61 Gull-wing opposing sun-bright wind, 62 I see the 
born who dare 63 Walk on green, walk against blue, 
64 Move in the nightlong flare 65 Of love on 
darkness, traveling 66 Among the rings of light to simple 
light, 67 From nowhere to nowhere. 68 And in my 
body feel the seasons grow. 69 Who is it in 
the dim room? Who is there?70 Death's threat! Today I 
have known laughter 71 As if for the first time; 
have seen into your eyes, 72 Death, past the still 
gaze, and found two I love. 73 One chose you 
gladly with a laugh advancing, 74 His hands full of 
guns, on the enemy in Spain. 75 The other living 
with the choice of life 76 Turning each day of 
living to the living day. 77 The strength, the grossness, 
spirit and gall of choice. 78 They came to me 
and said, "If you must choose, 79 Is it yourself 
or the child?" Laughter I learned 80 In that moment, 
laughter and choice of life. 81 I saw an immense 
ship trembling on the water 82 Lift by a gesture 
of hands. I saw a child. I saw 83 A 
red room, the eyes, the hands, the hands and eyes.84 
You will enter the world where death by fear and 
explosion 85 Is waited; longed for by many; by all 
dreamed. 86 You will enter the world where various poverty 
87 Makes thin the imagination and the bone. 88 You 
will enter the world where birth is walled about, 89 
Where years are walled journeys, death a walled-in act. 90 
You will enter the world which eats itself 91 Naming 
faith, reason, naming love, truth, fact. 92 You in your 
dark lake moving darkly now 93 Will leave a house 
that time makes, times to come 94 Enter the present, 
where all the deaths and all 95 The old betrayals 
have come home again. 96 World where again Judas, the 
little child, 97 May grow and choose. You will enter 
the world.98 Child who within me gives me dreams and 
sleep, 99 Your sleep, your dreams; you hold me in 
your flesh 100 Including me where nothing has included 101 
Until I said : I will include, will wish 102 
And in my belly be a birth, will keep 103 
All delicacy, all delight unclouded. 104 Dreams of an unborn 
child move through my dreams, 105 The sun is not 
alone in making fire and wave 106 Find meeting-place, for 
flesh and future meet, 107 The seal in the green 
wave like you in me, 108 Child. My blood at 
night full of your dreams, 109 Sleep coming by day 
as strong as sun on me, 110 Coming with sun-dreams 
where leaves and rivers meet, 111 And I at last 
alive sunlight and wave.112 Rider of dream, the body as 
an image 113 Alone in crisis. I have seen the 
wind, 114 Its tall cloud standing on a pillar of 
air, 115 The toe of the whirlwind turning on the 
ground. 116 Have known in myself hollow bodiless shade, 117 
The shadow falling from the tree to the ground, 118 
Have lost and lost and now at last am found 
119 For a moment of sleep and waking, striking root. 
120 Praise that the homeless may in their bodies be 
121 A house that time makes, where the future moves 
122 In his dark lake. Praise that the cities of 
men, 123 The fields of men, may at all moments 
choose. 124 Lose, use, and live. And at this daylight, 
praise 125 To the grace of the world and time 
that I may hope 126 To live, to write, to 
see my human child.
