1 Love 2 in whose rich honor 3 I stand 
looking from my window 4 over the starved trees of 
a dry September 5 Love 6 deep and so far 
forbidden 7 is bringing me 8 a gift 9 to 
claw at my skin 10 to break open my eyes 
11 the gift longed for so long 12 The power 
13 to write 14 out of the desperate ecstasy at 
last 15 death and madness
