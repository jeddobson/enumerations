1 Driven, at midnight, to growth, the city's wistful turnings 
2 lead you living on islands to some dark single 
house 3 where vacant windows mark increased pursuit, 4 chasing 
the runner outward beyond bounds 5 around the wildest circle 
of the night. 6 Circling returns! the city wreathed in 
rivers, 7 streaked skies surrounding islands of blank stone--- 8 
into this mythic track travelling breakneck, 9 a streaming furnace 
of escape, you, fox, 10 pursued, brick-red and vicious, circling 
bricks. 11 are followed as nimbly all mottled cloudy night; 
12 fastened upon your path, the Floating Man 13 face 
down above the city, as shadow, changing shape, 14 as 
shadow of clouds, flying, and swiftly as 15 indifference running 
mad around the world. 16 Speed now! see city, houses 
across the water, 17 mosaic and bright over the riverfall 
18 remote from the bursting eye, the open nostril, 19 
flared lip (an image of angels singing speed), 20 caught 
in a nightlong visionary chase. 21 See the entire scene 
bright as you fly 22 round lots pauper all year, 
shacks lame with weather, 23 this sour fertile time teeming 
and ramshackle 24 before you, loving, clean sight in spyglass 
air. 25 And around town again. River, river. 26 Why 
do people live on islands?
