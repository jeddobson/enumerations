St. George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner 1 Lying in the 
moment, she climbs white snows; 2 At the foot of 
the bed the chart relates. 3 Here a man burns 
in fever; he is here, he is there, 4 Five 
thousand years ago in the cave country. 5 In this 
bed, I go wandering in Macao, 6 I run all 
night the black alleys. Time runs 7 Over the edge 
and all exists in all. We hold 8 All human 
history, all geography, 9 I cannot remember the word for 
what I need. 10 Our explorations, all at the precipice, 
11 The night-table, a landscape of zebras, 12 Transistor constellations. 
All this music, 13 I heard it forming before I 
was born. I come 14 In this way, to the 
place. 15 Our selves lit clear, 16 This moment giving 
me necessity 17 Gives us ourselves and we risk everything, 
18 Walking into our life.
