of relations in poems and silences 113 For we were 
born to express born for a journey 114 Caves, theatres, 
the companioned solitary way 115 And then I came to 
the place of mournful labor 116 A turn in the 
road and the long sight from the cliff 117 Over 
the scene of the land dug away to nothing and 
many 118 Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of 
earth 119 A hod of earth taken and emptied and 
thrown away 120 Repeated farther than sight. The voice saying 
slowly 121 But it is hell. I heard my own 
voice in the words 122 Or it could be a 
foundation And after the words 123 My chance came. To 
enter. The theatres of the world.124 I think of the 
image brought into my room 125 Of the sage and 
the thin young man who flickers and asks. 126 He 
is asking about the moment when the Buddha 127 Offers 
the lotus, a flower held out as declaration. 128 "Isn't 
that fragile?" he asks. The sage answers: 129 "I speak 
to you. You speak to me. Is that fragile?"130 This 
journey is exploring us. Where the child stood 131 An 
island in a river of crisis, now 132 The bridges 
bind us in symbol, the sea 133 Is a bond, 
the sky reaches into our bodies. 134 We pray : 
we dive into each other's eyes. 135 Whatever can come 
to a woman can come to me. 136 This is 
the long body : into life from the beginning, 137 
Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds 138 
And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward, 139 
And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground, 
140 Going as we go in the changes of the 
body, 141 As it is changes, in the long strip 
of our many 142 Shapes, as we range shifting through 
time. 143 The long body : a procession of images. 
144 This moment in a city, in its dream of 
war. 145 We chose to be, 146 Becoming the only 
ones under the trees 147 when the harsh sound 148 
Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men, 
149 And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother 
feeding 150 Her baby. And threats, the ambulances with open 
doors. 151 Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We 
sang. 152 We are the living island, 153 We the 
flesh of this island, being lived, 154 Whoever knows us 
is part of us today. 155 Whatever can happen to 
anyone can happen to me. 156 Fire striking its word 
among us, waterlilies 157 Reaching from darkness upward to a 
sun 158 Of rebirth, the implacable. And in our myth 
159 The Changing Woman who is still and who offers. 
160 Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day 161 That 
struggles with itself, brings itself to birth. 162 In ways 
of being, through silence, sources of light 163 Arriving behind 
my eye, a dialogue of light. 164 And everything a 
witness of the buried life. 165 This moment flowing across 
the sun, this force 166 Of flowers and voices body 
in body through space. 167 The city of endless cycles 
of the sun. 168 I speak to you You speak 
to me
