"My love, my love, my love, why have you left 
me alone?" James Joyce 1 If I could write : 
Summer waits your coming, 2 the flowers are colored, but 
half-alive and weak, 3 earth sickens, as I sicken, with 
waiting, 4 and the clouds print on the dull moon 
a dark and blotting 5 streak. 6 If I could 
write : no energy is kinetic, 7 storm breaks nor 
foot falls, until you arrive 8 the trees thrive, but 
no fruit is born to hang 9 heavily : and 
the stale wind continues to drive 10 all pausing summer 
before it into the distance 11 from which you, shining, 
will come . . . . But summer lives, 12 
and minds grow, and nerves are sensitized to power 13 
and no winds wait, and not tree stands but gives 
14 richly to the store of the burning harvest : 
15 the door stands open for you, and other figures 
pass, 16 and I receive them joyfully and live : 
but wait for you 17 (and sometimes secretly watch for 
wrinkles, in my glass).
