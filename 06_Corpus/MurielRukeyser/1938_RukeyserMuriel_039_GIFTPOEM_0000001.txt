1 December steel done, flowers open color, 2 unshadowed brilliance 
enters the air again, 3 lets fear dissolve, 4 and 
convalescent brightness brush the face 5 until the subtlest rivers 
of sleep descend 6 over all eyelids, 7 and air 
lies gracious, lavishing general gold, 8 warming the lips, touching 
the salt away, 9 unlocking wishes, 10 until the lifelong 
travellers find their rest 11 in prodigal evening, marvel day, 
moonblaze, 12 superb ambassadors 13 whose power discloses sensual ease 
again 14 to these who come bringing flowers, standing still 
15 past wandering arrived at open spring.
