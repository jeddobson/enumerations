1 Gauley Bridge is a good town for Negroes, they 
let us stand 2 around, they let us stand 3 
around on the sidewalks if we're black or brown. 4 
Vanetta's over the trestle, and that's our town. 5 The 
hill makes breathing slow, slow breathing after you row 6 
the river, 7 and the graveyard's on the hill, cold 
in the springtime blow, 8 the graveyard's up on high, 
and the town is down below. 9 Did you ever 
bury thirty-five men in a place in back of your 
10 house, 11 thirty-five tunnel workers the doctors didn't attend, 
12 died in the tunnel camps, under rocks, everywhere, world 
13 without end. 14 When a man said I feel 
poorly, for any reason, any weakness or 15 such, 16 
letting up when he couldn't keep going barely, 17 the 
Cap and company come and run him off the job 
surely. 18 I've put them 19 DOWN from the tunnel 
camps 20 to the graveyard on the hill, 21 tin-cans 
all about---it fixed them!--- 22 TUNNELITIS 23 hold themselves up 
24 at the side of a tree, 25 I can 
go right now 26 to that cemetery. 27 When the 
blast went off the boss would call out, Come, let's 
28 go back, 29 when that heavy loaded blast went 
white, Come, let's go back, 30 telling us hurry, hurry, 
into the falling rocks and muck. 31 The water they 
would bring had dust in it, our drinking water, 32 
the camps and their groves were colored with the dust, 
33 we cleaned our clothes in the groves, but we 
always had the dust. 34 Looked like somebody sprinkled flour 
all over the parks and 35 groves, 36 it stayed 
and the rain couldn't wash it away and it twinkled 
37 that white dust really looked pretty down around our 
ankles. 38 As dark as I am, when I came 
out at morning after the tunnel 39 at night, 40 
with a white man, nobody could have told which man 
was 41 white. 42 The dust had covered us both, 
and the dust was white.
