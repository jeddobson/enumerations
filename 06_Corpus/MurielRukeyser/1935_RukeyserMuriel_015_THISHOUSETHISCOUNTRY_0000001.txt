1 Always I travelled farther 2 dreading a barrier 3 
starting at shadows scattered on the ground 4 fearful of 
the invisible night-sound, 5 till in that straight career 6 
I crossed frontier 7 the questions asked the proofs shown 
the name 8 signed smiling I reached knowledge of my 
home. 9 I praised their matings 10 and corner-meetings 11 
their streets the brightest I had yet walked down : 
12 my family swore I did not leave my town 
13 thought that I lied 14 and had not signed 
15 those passports, tickets, contracts, bills of sale 16 but 
still rested among them and wished them well. 17 Over 
my shoulder 18 I see they grow older 19 their 
vision fails : observe I travel light 20 fear distance 
hope I shall only spend the night. 21 But night 
in this country 22 is deep promise of day, 23 
is busy with preparations and awake for fighting 24 and 
there is no time for leavetaking and regretting. 25 I 
know their tired house 26 full of remorse 27 I 
know in my body the door, the entrance-hall 28 a 
wall and my space and another wall. 29 I have 
left forever 30 house and maternal river 31 given up 
sitting in that private tomb 32 quitted that land that 
house that velvet room. 33 Frontiers admitted me 34 to 
a growing country 35 I carry the proofs of my 
birth and my mind's reasons 36 but reckon with their 
struggle and their seasons.
