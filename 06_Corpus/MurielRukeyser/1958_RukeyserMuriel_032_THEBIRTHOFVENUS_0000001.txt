1 Risen in a 2 welter of waters. 3 Not 
as he saw her 4 standing upon a frayed and 
lovely surf 5 clean-riding the graceful leafy breezes 6 clean-poised 
and easy. Not yet. 7 But born in a 8 
tidal wave of the father's overthrow, 9 the old rule 
killed and its mutilated sex. 10 The testicles of the 
father-god, father of fathers, 11 sickled off by his son, 
the next god Time. 12 Sickled off. Hurled into the 
ocean. 13 In all that blood and foam, 14 among 
raving and generation, 15 of semen and the sea born, 
the 16 great goddess rises. 17 However, possibly, 18 on 
the long worldward voyage flowing, 19 horror gone down in 
birth, the curse, being changed, 20 being used, is translated 
far at the margin into 21 our rose and saving 
image, curling toward a shore 22 early and April, with 
certainly shells, certainly blossoms. 23 And the girl, the wellborn 
goddess, human love--- 24 young-known, new-knowing, mouth flickering, sure eyes--- 
25 rides shoreward, from death to us as we are 
at this moment, on 26 the crisp delightful Botticellian wave.
