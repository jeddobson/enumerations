22 Miner's phthisis, fibroid phthisis, 23 grinder's rot, potter's rot, 
24 whatever it used to be called, 25 these men 
did not need to die. 26 ---Is silicosis an occupational 
disease? 27 ---It is. 28 ---Did anyone show you the 
lungs of Cecil Jones? 29 ---Yes, sir. 30 ---Who was 
that? 31 ---It was Dr. Harless. "We talked to Dr. 
L. R. Harless, who had handled many of the cases, 
more than any other doctor there. At first Dr. Harless 
did not like to talk about the matter. He said 
he had been subjected to so much publicity. It appeared 
that the doctor thought he had been involved in too 
many of the court cases; but finally he opened up 
and told us about the matter." ---Did he impress you 
as one who thought this was a very serious thing 
in that section of the country? "Yes, he did. I 
would say that Dr. Harless has probably become very self-conscious 
about this matter. I cannot say that he has retracted 
what he told me, but possibly he had been thrust 
into the limelight so much that he is more conservative 
now than when the matter was simply something of local 
interest." Dear Sir: Due to illness of my wife and 
urgent professional duties, I am unable to appear as per 
your telegram. 36 Situation exaggerated. Here are facts : 37 
We examined. 13 dead. 139 had some lung damage. 38 
2 have died since, making 15 deaths. 39 Press says 
476 dead, 2,000 affected and doomed. 40 I am at 
a loss to know where those figures were obtained. 41 
At this time, only a few cases here, 42 and 
these only moderately affected. 43 Last death occurred November, 1934. 
It has been said that none of the men knew 
of the hazard connected with the work. This is not 
correct. Shortly after the work began many of these workers 
came to me complaining of chest conditions and I warned 
many of them of the dust hazard and advised them 
that continued work under these conditions would result in serious 
lung disease. Disregarding this warning many of the men contin- 
ued at this work and later brought suit against their 
employer for damages. While I am sure that many of 
these suits were based on meritorious grounds, I am also 
convinced that many others took advantage of this situation and 
made out of it nothing less than a racket. In 
this letter I have endeavored to give you the facts 
which came under my observation . . . . If 
I can supply further information . . . . Mr. 
Marcantonio. A man may be examined a year after he 
has worked in a tunnel and not show a sign 
of silicosis, and yet the silicosis may develop later; is 
not that true? ---Yes, it may develop as many as 
ten years after. Mr. Marcantonio. Even basing the statement on 
the figures, the doctor's claim that this is a racket 
is not justified? ---No; it would not seem to be 
justified. Mr. Marcantonio. I should like to point out that 
Dr. Harless contradicts his "exaggeration" when he volunteers the following: 
"I warned many . . . ." (Mr. Peyton. I 
do not know. Nobody knew the danger around there.) 54 
Dr. Goldwater. First are the factors involving the individual. 55 
Under the heading B, external causes. 56 Some of the 
factors which I have in mind--- 57 those are the 
facts upon the blackboard, 58 the influencing and controlling factors. 
59 Mr. Marcantonio. Those factors would bring about acute sili- 
60 cosis? 61 Dr. Goldwater. I hope you are not 
provoked when I say "might." 62 Medicine has no hundred 
percent. 63 We speak of possibilities, have opinions. 64 Mr. 
Griswold. Doctors testify answering "yes" and "no." 65 Don't they? 
66 Dr. Goldwater. Not by the choice of the doctor. 
67 Mr. Griswold. But that is usual, isn't it? 68 
Dr. Goldwater. They do not like to do that. 69 
A man with a scientific point of view--- 70 unfortunately 
there are doctors without that--- 71 I do not mean 
to say all doctors are angels--- 72 but most doctors 
avoid dogmatic statements. 73 avoid assiduously "always," "never." 74 Mr. 
Griswold. Best doctor I ever knew said "no" and "yes." 
75 Dr. Goldwater. There are different opinions on that, too. 
76 We were talking about acute silicosis. 77 The man 
in the white coat is the man on the hill, 
78 the man with the clean hands is the man 
with the drill, 79 the man who answers "yes" lies 
still. 80 ---Did you make an examination of those sets 
of lungs? 81 ---I did. 82 ---I wish you would 
tell the jury whether or not those lungs were 83 
silicotic. 84 ---We object. 85 ---Objection overruled. 86 ---They were.
