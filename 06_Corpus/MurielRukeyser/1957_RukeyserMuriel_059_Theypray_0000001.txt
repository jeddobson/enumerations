1 They pray. Security against oldness 2 And death---for the 
gilding of all things. 3 Under the lights. On the 
porches, rocking, and at the Iowa 4 picnic. 5 Drugged 
by wanhope, seduction, or the drugs. 6 Among the filling 
stations, between the orange trees, 7 Burst with illusion, listening 
for the faint 8 Tympans of rumor. Fame. Disaster. Or 
the sudden 9 Wild nimbus that cheats prediction and the 
grave. 10 A tower of linked intestines, cemented, climbing 11 
Over the orange faces, digesting the world. 12 It cannot; 
it turns to digest itself. 13 But the incredible fifteen-year-old 
14 Uncorrupt in her moment, standing at Vine. 15 ¶ 
From the Committee to Aid Migratory Workers: 16 We were 
accused of contributing to radical causes. 17 When you are 
told a person is sick or in need, 18 You 
don't ask him his religion, nationality or politics ... 19 
They will be obsessed by the word "security." 20 ¶ 
When Hollywood gets aroused, it gets aroused. 21 ¶ This 
is not a campaign. It's a crusade. 22 ---Willkie at
