1 In the wine country, poverty, they drink no wine--- 
2 In the endless night of love he lies, apart 
from love--- 3 In the landscape of the Word he 
stares, he has no word. 4 He hates and hungers 
for his immense need. 5 He is young. This is 
a shepherd who rages at learning, 6 Having no words. 
Looks past green grass and sees a woman. 7 She, 
Rachel, who is come to recognize. 8 In the huge 
wordless shepherd she finds Akiba. 9 To find the burning 
Word. To learn to speak. 10 The body of Rachel 
says, the marriage says, 11 The eyes of Rachel say, 
and water upon rock 12 Cutting its groove all year 
says All things learn. 13 Me learns with his new 
son whose eyes are wine. 14 To sing continually, to 
find the word. 15 He comes to teaching, greater than 
the deed 16 Because it begets the deed, he comes 
to the stone 17 Of long ordeal, and suddenly knows 
the brook 18 Offering water, the citron fragrance, the light 
of candles. 19 All given, and always the giver loses 
nothing. 20 In giving, praising, we move beneath clouds of 
honor, 21 In giving, in praise, we take gifts that 
are given, 22 The spark from one to the other 
leaping, a bond 23 Of light, and we come to 
recognize the rock; 24 We are the rock acknowledging water, 
and water 25 Fire, and woman man, all brought through 
wilderness; 26 And Rachel finding in the wordless shepherd 27 
Akiba who can now come to his power and speak: 
28 The need to give having found the need to 
become: 29 More than the calf wants to suck, the 
cow wants to give such.
