1 We set great wreaths of brightness on the graves 
of the 2 passionate 3 who required tribute of hot 
July flowers : 4 for you, O brittle-hearted, we bring 
offering 5 remembering how your wrists were thin and your 
delicate bones 6 not yet braced for conquering. 7 The 
sharp cries of ghost-boys are keen above the meadows, 8 
the little girls continue graceful and wondering; 9 flickering evening 
on the lakes recalls those young 10 heirs whose developing 
years have sunk to earth 11 their strength not tested, 
their praise unsung. 12 Weave grasses for their childhood : 
who will never see 13 love or disaster or take 
sides against decay 14 balancing the choices of maturity; 15 
silent and coffin'd in silence while we pass 16 loud 
in defiance of death, the helpless lie.
