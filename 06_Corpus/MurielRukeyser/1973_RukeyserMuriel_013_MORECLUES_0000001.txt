1 Mother, because you never spoke to me 2 I 
go my life, do I, searching in women's faces 3 
the lost word, a word in the shape of a 
breast? 4 Father, because both of you never touched me 
5 do I search for men building space on space? 
6 There was no touch, both my hands bandaged close. 
7 I come from that, but I come far, to 
touch to word. 8 Can they reach me now, or 
inside out in a universe 9 of touch, of speech 
is it? somewhere in me, clues?
