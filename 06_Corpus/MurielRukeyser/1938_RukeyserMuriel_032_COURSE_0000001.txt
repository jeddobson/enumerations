for Betty Marshall 1 Years before action when the wish 
alone 2 has ammunition to threaten weakness down, 3 when 
thriving on discovery we speak 4 and wish a world 
5 that wishing may not make. 6 Stretching our powers, 
we touch a broader street 7 crowded with hostile weapons 
and the weight 8 of death suggesting we see peace 
at last 9 and quiet cities, 10 rip out the 
eyes, and have our rest. 11 But we are set 
enough to clear a space 12 ample for action in 
this eccentric house. 13 An army of wishers in a 
dramatic grip 14 and crazy with 15 America has heat 
to keep its purpose up. 16 Determined to a world 
that Mr. Fist 17 and all his gang can't master 
or digest, 18 strengthened against the world that cannot hush 
19 words singing down 20 the fever voice of death 
working against the wish.
