1 In your time, there have been those who spoke 
clearly 2 For the moment of lightning. 3 Were we 
all brave, but at different times? 4 Even raped open 
and split, even anonymous, 5 They spoke. They are not 
forgotten. 6 But they are. In late summer; forgot; caught 
at cross- 7 purposes, 8 Interrupted in an hour of 
purity, 9 Their lives careening along in the fierce cities, 
10 Through atrocious poverties and magnificence, 11 The unforgotten, the 
early gone forgot. 12 Late daytime, and nothing left to 
hide but an eye endowed 13 With the charred, guilty, 
gouged by war, the raging splendor; 14 Despised like you, 
criminal in intent; sunburnt, in love and 15 splendid; 16 
This heart, naked and knocking, going in clouds, 17 Smoke 
and a cry of light. 18 In pain, the voice 
of pain. The shadow of your cry. 19 And never 
forget : you are magnificent beyond all colors.
