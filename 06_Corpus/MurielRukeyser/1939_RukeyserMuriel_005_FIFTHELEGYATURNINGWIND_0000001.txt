1 Knowing the shape of the country. Knowing the midway 
to 2 migrant fanatics, living that life, up with the 
dawn and 3 moving as long as the light lasts, 
and when the sun is falling 4 to wait, still 
standing; 5 and when the black has come, at last 
lie down, too tired to 6 turn to each other, 
feeling only the land's demand under them 7 Shape that 
exists not as permanent quality, but varies with 8 even 
the movement of bone. 9 Even in skeletons, it depends 
on the choices of action. 10 A definite plan is 
visible. We are either free-moving or 11 fixed to some 
ground. The shape has no meaning 12 outside of the 
function. 13 Fixed to Europe, the distant, adjacent, we lived, 
with the land--- 14 promise of life of our own. 
Course down the East ---frontiers 15 meet you at every 
turn---the headlights find them, the plain's, 16 and the solar 
cities' 17 recurrent centers. And at the middle of the 
great world the wind 18 answers the shape of the 
country, a turning traveller 19 follows the hinge-line of coast, 
the first indefinite 20 axis of symmetry 21 torn off 
from sympathy with the past and planted, 22 a primitive 
streak prefiguring the west, an ideal 23 which had to 
be modified for stability, 24 to make it work. 25 
Architecture is fixed not only by present needs but 26 
also by ancestors. The actual structure means a plan 27 
determined 28 by the nature of ancestors; its details are 
determined by 29 function and interference. 30 There are these 
major divisions : for those attached to the seafloor, 31 
a fan at freedom, flexible, wavering, designed to catch food 
32 from all directions. For the sedentary, for those who 
crouch 33 and look, 34 radial symmetry, 35 spokes to 
all margins for support. For those who want 36 movement, 
37 this is achieved through bilateral symmetry only, 38 a 
spine and straight attack, all muscles working, 39 up and 
alive. 40 And there are years of roads, and centuries 
of need, 41 of walking along the shadow of a 
wall, of visiting houses, 42 hearing the birds trapped in 
the wall, the framework trembling 43 with struggles of birds, 
44 years of nightwalking in stranger cities, relost and unnamed, 
45 recurrent familiar rooms, furnished only with nightmare, 46 recurrent 
loves, the glass eye of unreal ambition, 47 years of 
initiation, 48 of dishallucination on the diamond meadows, 49 seeing 
the distances of false capes ahead, 50 feeling the tide-following 
and turning wind, 51 travelling farther 52 under abrasive weather, 
to the bronzy river, 53 the rust, the brown, the 
terrible dead swamps, 54 the hanging moss the color of 
all the hanged, 55 cities whose heels 56 ring out 
their news of hell upon all streets 57 churches where 
you betray yourself, pray ended desire, 58 white wooden houses 
of village squares. Always one gesture : 59 rejecting of 
backdrops. 60 These are the ritual years, whose lore is 
names of shapes, 61 Grabtown, Cockade Alley, Skid Row where 
jobless live, 62 their emblem a hitch-hiker with lips basted 
together, 63 and marvel rivers, 64 the flooded James, a 
double rainbow standing over Richmond, 65 the remnant sky above 
the Cape Fear River, blue stain on red water, 66 
the Waccamaw with its bone-trees, Piscataqua's rich mouth, 67 red 
Sound and flesh of sand. 68 ---A nation of refugees 
that will not learn its name; 69 still shows these 
mothers enduring, their hidden faces, 70 the cry of the 
hurt child at a high night-window, 71 hand-to-hand warfare, 72 
the young sitting in libraries at their only rest 73 
or making love in the hallway under an orange bulb, 
74 the boy playing baseball at Hungry Mother State Park, 
75 bestiaries of cities 76 and this shape, this meaning 
that promises seasonal joy. 77 Whose form is unquietness and 
yet the seeker of rest, 78 whose travelling hunger has 
range enough, its root 79 grips through the world. 80 
The austere fire-world of night : Gary or Bethlehem, 81 
in sacred stacks of flame---or stainless morning, 82 anti-sunlight of 
lakes' reflection, matchlight on face, 83 the thorny light of 
fireworks 84 lighting a way for the shape, this country 
of celebrations 85 deep in a passage of rebirth. Adventures 
of countries, 86 adventures of travellers, visions, or Christ's adventures 
87 forever following him 88 lit by the night-light of 
history, persevering 89 into the incredible washed morning air. 90 
The luisarne swamp is our guide and the glare ice, 
91 the glow of tracklights, 92 the lights winding themselves 
into a single beacon, 93 big whooping riders of night, 
a wind that whirls 94 all of our motives into 
a single stroke, 95 shows us a country 96 of 
which the birds know mountains that we have not dreamed, 
97 climbing these unsuspected slopes they fade. Butte and 98 
pavilion 99 vanish into a larger scape, morning vaults all 
those hills 100 rising on ranges 101 that stand gigantic 
on the roots of the world, 102 where points expand 
in pleasure of raw sweeping 103 gestures of joy, whose 
winds sweep down like stairs, 104 and the felled forests 
105 on hurricane ridges show a second growth. The dances 
106 of turkeys near storm, a pouring light, tornado 107 
umbilical to earth, fountains of rain, a development 108 controlled 
by centers, 109 until the organs of this anatomy are 
fleshed away at last 110 of gross, and determining self, 
develop a final structure 111 in isolation. Masterpieces of happiness 
arrive, 112 alive again in another land, 113 remembering pain, 
faces of suffering, but they know growth, 114 go through 
the world, hunger and rest desiring life. 115 Mountains are 
spines to their conquest, these wrecked houses 116 (vines spiral 
the pillars) 117 are leaning their splintered sides on tornadoes, 
lifted careening 118 in wheels, in whirlwind, in a spool 
of power 119 drawing a spiral on the sun, drawing 
a sign of 120 strength on the mountains, 121 the 
fusing stars lighting initiated cities. 122 The thin poor whiteness 
raining on the ground 123 forgotten in fickle eclipses, thunderbirds 
of dream 124 following omens, 125 following charts of the 
moving constellations. 126 Charts of the country of all visions, 
imperishable 127 stars of our old dream : process, which 
having neither 128 sorrow nor joy 129 remains as promised, 
the embryo in the fire. 130 The tilted cities of 
America, fields of metal, 131 the seamless wheatfields, the current 
of cities running 132 below our wings 133 promise that 
knowledge of systems which may bless. 134 May permit knowledge 
of self, a lover's wish of conversion 135 until the 
time when the dead lake rises in light, 136 the 
shape is organized in travelling space, 137 this hope of 
travel, to find the place again, 138 rest in the 
triumph of the reconceived, 139 lie down again together face 
to face.
