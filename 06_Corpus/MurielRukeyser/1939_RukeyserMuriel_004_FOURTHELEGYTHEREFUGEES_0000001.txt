1 And the child sitting alone planning her hope: 2 
I want to write for my race. But what race 
will you speak, 3 being American? I want to write 
for the living. 4 But the young grow more around 
us every day. 5 They show new faces, they come 
from far, they live 6 occupied with escape, freeze in 
the passes, sail 7 early in the morning. A few 
arrive to help. 8 Mother, those were not angels, they 
were knights. 9 Many are cast out, become artists at 
rejection. 10 They saw the chute, the intelligible world 11 
so wild become, it fell, a hairy apparent star 12 
this time with not a public saint in sight 13 
to record miracle. The age of the masked and the 
alone 14 begins, 15 we look for sinister states, a 
loss shall learning suffer 16 before the circle of this 
sun be done, 17 the palace birds of the new 
tyrants rise 18 flying into the wounded sky, sky of 
catastrophe; 19 help may be near, but remedy is far, 
20 rain, blood, milk, famine, iron, and epidemic 21 pour 
in the sky where a comet drags his tail. 22 
The characters of the spectacles are dead, 23 nothing is 
left but ventriloquists and children, 24 and bodies without souls 
are not a sacrifice. 25 It is the children's voyage 
must be done 26 before the refugees come home again. 
27 They run like lemmings out 28 building their suffocated 
bodies up 29 to let the full stream pass. 30 
The predatory birds sail over them. 31 They dash themselves 
into lighthouses, where the great 32 lights hold up, 33 
they laugh at sympathy: "Have you nothing better to do 
34 in the trenches?" 35 And at that brink, that 
bending over doom, 36 become superior to themselves, in crisis. 
37 There is an addition and fusion of qualities. 38 
They are the children. They have their games. 39 They 
made a circle on a map of time, 40 skipping 
they entered it, laughing lifted the agate. 41 I will 
get you an orange cat, and a pig called Tangerine. 
42 The gladness-bird beats wings against an opaque glass. 43 
There is a white bird in the top of the 
tree. 44 They leave their games, and pass. 45 Cut. 
Frozen and cut. Off at the ankle. Off at the 
hip. 46 Off at the knee. Cut off. 47 Crossing 
the mountains many died of cold. 48 We have spoken 
of guilt to you too long. 49 The blame grows 
on us who carry you the news. 50 And as 
the man bringing the story of suicide 51 lives with 
the fact, feels murder in himself, 52 as murderous regents 
with their gentle kings 53 know the seductions of crime 
long before death takes hold, 54 we bear their--- 55 
a child crying shrill in a white street 56 "Aviaci√≥n!" 
among the dust of geysers, 57 the curling rust of 
Spanish tile. 58 We bear their smile, we smile under 
the guilt, 59 in an access of sickness, "Let me 
alone, I'm healthy!" 60 cry. And in danger, the sexually 
witty 61 speak in short sentences, the unfulfilled. 62 While 
definition levels others out. 63 Wish : the unreality of 
fulfilled action. 64 Wish : the reality of fulfilled thought. 
65 Images of luxury. Image of life. 66 A phoenix 
at play among the peonies. 67 The random torture predicts 
the random thought. 68 Over the thought and bird and 
flowers, the plane. 69 Coming to strange countries refugee children 
find 70 land burned over by winter, a white field 
and black star 71 falling like firework where no rockets 
are 72 into hell-cities with blank brick and church-bells 73 
(I like this city. This is a peaceful city) 74 
ringing the bees in the hot garden with their mixing 
sounds, 75 ringing the love that falters among these hills, 
76 red-flowering maple and the laugh of peace. 77 It 
will take a bell-ringing god tremendous imagined descending 78 for 
the healing of hell. 79 A line of birds, a 
line of gods. Of bells. 80 And all the birds 
have settled on their shadows. 81 And down the shadowed 
street a line of children. 82 You can make out 
the child ahead of you. 83 It turns with a 
gesture that asks for a soft answer. 84 It sees 
the smaller child ahead of it. 85 The child ahead 
of it turns. Now, in the close-up 86 faces throw 
shadow off. It is yourself 87 walks down this street 
at five-year intervals, 88 seeing yourself diminishing ahead, 89 five 
years younger, and five years younger, and young, 90 until 
the farthest infant has a face 91 ready to grow 
into any child in the world. 92 They take to 
boats. The shipwreck of New York. 93 To trains whose 
sets of lines pass along boxes, 94 children's constructions. 95 
Rush to rejection 96 foreknowing the steps, 97 disfigurement of 
women, insults of disease, 98 negations of power. They people 
the earth. 99 They are the strong. They see the 
enemy. 100 They dream the relaxed heart, coming again to 
power, 101 the struggle, the Milk-Tree of Children's Paradise. 102 
They are the real creation of a fictional character. 103 
They fuse a dead world straight. 104 A line of 
shadowy children issues, surf issues it, 105 sickness boiled in 
their flesh, but they are whole, 106 insular strength surrounds 
them, hunger feeds them strong, 107 the ripened sun finds 
them, they are the first of the world, 108 free 
of the ferryman Nostalgia, who stares at the backward shore. 
109 Growing free of the old in their slow growth 
of death, 110 they hold the flaming apples of the 
spring. 111 They are exposed to danger. 112 Ledges of 
water trick them, 113 they fall through the raw colors 
of excavations, 114 are crushed by monuments, high stone like 
whale-blow rising, 115 the backwash of machines can strike them 
down. 116 A hill on a map claims them, their 
procession reaches 117 a wavy topographical circle where 118 two 
gunners lie behind their steelwork margins, 119 spray shot across 
the line, do random death. 120 They fire in a 
world infected by trenches, 121 through epidemics of injuries, Madrid, 
Shanghai, 122 Vienna, Barcelona, all cities of contagion, 123 issue 
survivors from the surf of the age. 124 Free to 
be very hungry and very lonely. 125 And in the 
countries of the mind, Cut off at the knee. Cut 
off 126 at the armpit. Cut off at the throat. 
127 Free to reclaim the world and sow a legend, 
128 to make the adjustments never made, 129 repair the 
promises broken and the promise kept. 130 They blame our 
lives, lie on our wishes with their eyes our own, 
131 to say and to remember and avenge. A lullaby 
for a believing child.
