1 After the revolution came the Fuehrer; 2 And after 
the resurrection, the Christian Era. 3 Not yet simple and 
not yet free. 4 Just after the Exodus, in the 
divided sea 5 The chariots drowned, and then the tempering 
6 By forty sandy years of misery. 7 And after 
the King of the Jews came Godfrey King; 8 Kneedeep 
in blood the children wandering, 9 Holy Holy Holy hear 
the children sing. 10 Now mouthdeep nosedeep the fires reach 
our eye. 11 Teach us from torment to fly and 
not to fly. 12 Not yet safe, not ready to 
die. 13 Illumination and night cast on the eyes of 
those 14 Believing and fighting, playing the Worldly Fool, 15 
Fool of Thy Word, who feel the century 16 Rule, 
under whose deep wave explosion waits; 17 We know the 
dead power of Thy Allied States. 18 Not yet simple 
and not yet free. 19 Sailing, remembering the rock and 
the child, 20 Sailing remember the sand, the city, the 
wild 21 Holy songs. Deaths! Pillar of cloud and sun, 
22 Remember us and remember them and all 23 Not 
safe, not free sailing again upon 24 The sacred dangerous 
harbor, Jerusalem.
