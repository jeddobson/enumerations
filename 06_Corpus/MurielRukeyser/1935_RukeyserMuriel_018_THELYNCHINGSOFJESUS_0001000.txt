saints the 126 Jews the rebels 127 but the noise 
stirred their graves' grass 128 and the feet all falling 
in those places 129 going up the hill with sheaves 
and tools 130 and all the weapons of ascent together.131 
The South is green with coming spring ; revival 132 
flourishes in the fields of Alabama. Spongy with rain, 133 
plantations breathe April : carwheels suck mud in the roads, 
134 the town expands warm in the afternoons. At night 
the 135 black boy 136 teeters no-handed on a bicycle, 
whistling The St. Louis Blues, 137 blood beating, and hot 
South. A red brick courthouse 138 is vicious with men 
inviting death. Array your judges; call your 139 jurors; come, 
140 here is your justice, come out of the crazy 
jail. 141 Grass is green now in Alabama; Birmingham dusks 
are quiet 142 relaxed and soft in the park, stern 
at the yards : 143 a hundred boxcars shunted off 
to sidings, and the hoboes 144 gathering grains of sleep 
in forbidden corners. 145 In all the yards : Atlanta, 
Chattanooga, 146 Memphis, and New Orleans, the cars, and no 
jobs. 147 Every night the mail-planes burrow the sky, 148 
carrying postcards to laughing girls in Texas, 149 passionate letters 
to the Charleston virgins, 150 words through the South : 
and no reprieve, 151 no pardon, no release. 152 A 
blinded statue attends before the courthouse, 153 bronze and black 
men lie on the grass, waiting, 154 the khaki dapper 
National Guard leans on its bayonets. 155 But the air 
is populous beyond our vision : 156 all the people's 
anger finds its vortex here 157 as the mythic lips 
of justice open, and speak. 158 Hammers and sickles are 
carried in a wave of strength, fire- 159 tipped, 160 
swinging passionately ninefold to a shore. 161 Answer the back-thrown 
Negro face of the lynched, the flat 162 forehead knotted, 
163 the eyes showing a wild iris, the mouth a 
welter of blood, 164 answer the broken shoulders and these 
twisted arms. 165 John Brown, Nat Turner, Toussaint stand in 
this courtroom, 166 Dred Scott wrestles for freedom there in 
the dark corner, 167 all our celebrated shambles are repeated 
here : now again 168 Sacco and Vanzetti walk to 
a chair, to the straps and rivets 169 and the 
switch spitting death and Massachusetts' will. 170 Wreaths are brought 
out of history 171 here are the well-nourished flowers of 
France, grown strong 172 on blood, 173 Caesar twisting his 
thin throat toward conquest, turning 174 north from the Roman 
laurels, 175 the Istrian galleys slide again to sea. 176 
How they waded through bloody Godfrey's Jerusalem! 177 How the 
fires broke through Europe, and the rich 178 and the 
tall jails battened on revolution! 179 The fastidious Louis', cousins 
to the sun, stamping 180 those ribboned heels on Calas, 
on the people; 181 the lynched five thousand of America. 
182 Tom Mooney from San Quentin, Herndon : here 183 
is an army for audience 184 all resolved 185 to 
a gobbet of tobacco, spat, and the empanelled hundred, 186 
a jury of vengeance, the cheap pressed lips, the narrow 
eyes like 187 hardware; 188 the judge, his eye-sockets and 
cheeks dark and immutably 189 secret, 190 the twisting mouth 
of the prosecuting attorney. 191 Nine dark boys spread their 
breasts against Alabama, 192 schooled in the cells, fathered by 
want. 193 Mother : one writes : they treat us 
bad. If they 194 send us 195 back to Kilby 
jail, I think I shall kill myself. 196 I think 
I must hang myself by my overalls. 197 Alabama and 
the South are soft with spring; 198 in the North, 
the seasons change, sweet April, December and 199 the air 
200 loaded with snow. There is time for meetings 201 
during the years, they remaining in prison. 202 In the 
Square. 203 a crowd listens, carrying banners. 204 Overhead, boring 
through the speaker's voice, a plane 205 circles with a 
snoring of motors revolving in the sky, 206 drowning the 
single voice. It does not touch 207 the crowd's silence. 
It circles. The name stands : 208 Scottsboro 209 Earth, 
include sky : air, be stable to our 210 feet, 
which have need of stone and iron stance; 211 all 
opposites, affirm your contradictions, 212 lead, all you prophets, our 
mechanic dance. 213 Arches over the earth, conform, be still, 
214 calm Roman in the evening cool of grace, 215 
dramatic Gothic, be finally rounded now 216 pared equal to 
the clean savannahs of space, 217 grind levels to one 
plane, unfold the stones 218 that shaped you pointed, return 
to ground, return, 219 bird be no more a brand 
upon the sky 220 no more a torch to which 
earth's bodies burn 221 fire attracting fire in magnetism 222 
too subtle for dissection and proponence, 223 torturing fire, crucifying 
posture 224 with which dead Jesus quenches his opponents. 225 
Shall we then straddle Jesus in a plane 226 the 
rigid crucified revived at last 227 the pale lips flattened 
in a wind a rain 228 of merging conquered blast 
and counterblast. 229 Shout to us : See ! 230 
the wind ! 231 Shout to us : 232 FLY
