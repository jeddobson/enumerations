1 These are the lines on which a committee is 
formed. 2 Almost as soon as work was begun in 
the tunnel 3 men began to die among dry drills. 
No masks. 4 Most of them were not from this 
valley. 5 The freights brought many every day from States 
6 all up and down the Atlantic seaboard 7 and 
as far inland as Kentucky, Ohio. 8 After the work 
the camps were closed or burned. 9 The ambulance was 
going day and night, 10 White's undertaking business thriving and 
11 his mother's cornfield put to a new use. 12 
"Many of the shareholders at this meeting 13 "were nervous 
about the division of the profits; 14 "How much has 
the Company spent on lawsuits? 15 "The man said $150,000. 
Special counsel : 16 "I am familiar with the case. 
Not : one : cent. 17 " 'Terms of the 
contract. Master liable.' 18 "No reply. Great corporation disowning men 
who made . . . ." 19 After the lawsuits 
had been instituted . . . . 20 The Committee 
is a true reflection of the will of the people. 
21 Every man is ill. The women are not affected, 
22 This is not a contagious disease. A medical commission, 
23 Dr. Hughes, Dr. Hayhurst examined the chest 24 of 
Raymond Johnson, and Dr. Harless, a former 25 company doctor. 
But he saw too many die, 26 he has written 
his letter to Washington. 27 The Committee meets regularly, wherever 
it can. 28 Here are Mrs. Jones, three lost sons, 
husband sick, 29 Mrs. Leek, cook for the bus cafeteria, 
30 the men : George Robinson, leader and voice, 31 
four other Negroes (three drills, one camp-boy) 32 Blankenship, the 
thin friendly man, Peyton the engineer, 33 Juanita absent, the 
one outsider member. 34 Here in the noise, loud belts 
of the shoe-repair shop, 35 meeting around the stove beneath 
the one bulb hanging. 36 They come late in the 
day. Many come with them 37 who pack the hall, 
wait in the thorough dark. 38 This is a defense 
committee. Unfinished business : 39 Two rounds of lawsuits, 200 
cases 40 Now as to the crooked lawyers 41 If 
the men had worn masks, their use would have involved 
42 time every hour to wash the sponge at mouth. 
43 Tunnel, 3 1 / 8 miles long. Much larger 
than 44 the Holland Tunnel or Pittsburgh's Liberty Tubes. 45 
Total cost, say, $16,000,000. 46 This is the procedure of 
such a committee: 47 To consider the bill before the 
Senate. 48 To discuss relief. 49 Active members may be 
cut off relief, 50 16-mile walk to Fayetteville for cheque--- 
51 WEST VIRGINIA RELIEF ADMINISTRATION, #22991, 52 TO JOE HENIGAN, 
GAULEY BRIDGE, ONE AND 50/100, 53 WINONA NATIONAL BANK. PAID 
FROM STATE FUNDS. 54 Unless the Defense Committee acts; 55 
the People's Press , supporting this fight, 56 signed editorials, 
sent in funds. 57 Clothing for tunnel-workers. 58 Rumored, that 
in the post-office 59 parcels are intercepted. 60 Suspected: Conley. 
Sheriff, hotelman, 61 head of the town ring--- 62 Company 
whispers. Spies, 63 The Racket. 64 Resolved, resolved. 65 George 
Robinson holds all their strength together : 66 To fight 
the companies to make somehow a future. 67 "At any 
rate, it is inadvisable to keep a community of dying 
68 persons intact." 69 "Senator Holt. Yes. This is the 
most barbarous example of 70 industrial construction that ever happened 
in the world." 71 Please proceed. 72 "In a very 
general way Hippocrates' Epidemics speaks 73 of the metal digger 
who breathes with difficulty, 74 having a pain and wan 
complexion. 75 Pliny, the elder . . . ." 76 
"Present work of the Bureau of Mines . . . 
." 77 The dam's pure crystal slants upon the river. 
78 A dark and noisy room, frozen two feet from 
stove. 79 The cough of habit. The sound of men 
in the hall 80 waiting for word. 81 These men 
breathe hard 82 but the committee has a voice of 
steel. 83 One climbs the hill on canes. 84 They 
have broken the hills and cracked the riches wide. 85 
In this man's face 86 family leans out from two 
worlds of graves--- 87 here is a room of eyes, 
88 a single force looks out, reading our life. 89 
Who stands over the river? 90 Whose feet go running 
in these rigid hills? 91 Who comes, warning the night, 
92 shouting and young to waken our eyes? 93 Who 
runs through electric wires? 94 Who speaks down every road? 
95 Their hands touched mastery; now they 96 demand an 
answer.
