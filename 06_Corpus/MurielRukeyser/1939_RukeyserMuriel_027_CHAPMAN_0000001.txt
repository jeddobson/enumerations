1 Returns to punishment as we all return, in agonized 
initiation 2 proving America, 3 a country returning to moments 
of conversion, in agony 4 supporting its changes, receiving 5 
the past, the clews of instinct, and the rich return: 
6 conviction in our people's face, all in pain. 7 
He dances in Boston, the young and turning side 8 
turned to a room of marvellous skirts whose rustle 9 
like burning paper alters, rustling black to flame. 10 He 
looks across all rooms to a sibyl-minded woman 11 the 
dark the clew to life whose afternoons 12 he shares 
through Dante's climbing Paradise 13 to break his youth, the 
handsome turning side 14 dancing and turning again to her 
dark head 15 in rings of darkness whose God is 
ringed in light 16 which coils and revolves around him--- 
17 in the smoky garden 18 after the word was 
spoken 19 the blow to the rival's smoky head echoing 
in the hand 20 ringed round with darkness; 21 dark 
passages through streets unknown; and now, at home, 22 he 
sees his braced arm, ringing with the shock, 23 given 
before him to the ringing fire. 24 Blaze of hard-coal. 
Disapparition of flesh. 25 He draws his hand out of 
flame; charred to the bone, 26 white knuckles and finger-bones 
exposed. 27 His soul rises screaming in the shape of 
an eagle. 28 He says, quietly and exactly, "This will 
never do." 29 "The one time in my life I 
lived was twenty days of pain." 30 And later, after 
the healing, after the marriage, 31 alone among red desert, 
the wild bushes' grey-green, 32 the red buttes cancelling half 
the sky, he writes. 33 "It was not waste land 
in Colorado. Not waste time, for 34 "you are here 
and many lives packed into one life, 35 "the green 
shoot out of the heart of the plant, springing up 
36 blossoms in the night; 37 "many old things have 
put on immortality, 38 "and lost things have come back 
knocking within 39 "from before the time I was conceived 
in the womb, 40 "there were you also. 41 "And 
of the pain! it was false, 42 "and the rending, 
unnecessary. 43 "The breaking down of dams that ought never 
be up, 44 "but being up it was the sweeping 
away 45 "that the waters might flow together." 46 The 
life all burning on the public hill, 47 the men 
living tramoft, travelling through their deaths, 48 arrive with marks 
by which they know one another 49 at the center 
of systems. By a breach of childhood 50 symptoms of 
health declare all the signs leading through, 51 until the 
crisis comes, 52 air seethes, and all the bushes flicker 
up, 53 memories parasite in the life underground 54 irrupt 
with convulsions and the speech of fire. 55 At the 
focus, the cool life is insufficient. 56 He knows his 
conversion. He speaks of Whitman as tramp: 57 "By an 
act as simple as death, he puts off effort and 
lives in 58 peace." 59 Knowing by what redemption he 
claims his house, 60 he stands on the balcony of 
a burning building. 61 The ghosts come near the blood. 
Sits at the bedside reading 62 to the dropped quiet 
head, Dante and fire and coexistent death 63 at his 
wife's bedside. 64 Fire, rage, splendor; and terror 65 who 
judges the judgment of men. 66 He is broken, his 
face is broken back, 67 his spirit's legs are broken, 
crutches hold him, 68 a second wife holds him while 
he becomes 69 incredible to himself, fulgurite fused by lightning, 
70 health shaking its flag of death in his frenetic 
head. 71 Death of his son, and he heals, he 
is born again, 72 fed on his agonies, wanting again 
73 his gritty taste of truth. 74 There are those 
who are many-born. There is the man 75 who will 
plunge his hand in the fire this evening, who goes 
out 76 every day 77 seeing Prometheus in mirrors, finding 
78 comets, men of the people, conscious, who take their 
place 79 in national revulsion producing a nation's poems, 80 
belong to the present, are not sterilized 81 by breaks 
from the past. 82 He fights for the acute senses, 
terror, passion, and need. 83 "I make it a policy 
to say nothing I will not regret." 84 Speaks from 
a cart-end, manhandles his hecklers, 85 knows the struggles of 
treason making it easy for death 86 to arrive when 
the living have passed the perfection of youth. 87 The 
century bursts upward in shocks of flame, 88 fireworks' starfish 
of imperial spirit, 89 ordeals by fire : he fights 
the finished wars, 90 looks back to slavery. They burn 
the shingles down, 91 the lynched face broken back, mouth 
filled with fire, 92 firebrand full in face. The ashes 
rise. 93 Chapman arrives to face his empty hall, 94 
courtly, one-handed, turning his handsome side 95 upon the hall 
to face his audience, 96 one Negro woman come to 
hear. Undoings 97 walking in all forms, treacheries of the 
deep 98 spirit caught in the net. Our need is 
of new life. 99 There are these tendencies in America: 
100 they planned John Brown; they do what will be 
done. 101 Birth after birth, in the spanned democratic 102 
passage of birth, the incubation motive, 103 desire's experience, tense 
for finality. 104 He is reborn too often; the shock 
cannot take. 105 He loosens; fights for war; fights Harvard's 
plans: 106 a stone for both sides---he rants, upholstered deep 
107 in Harvard Club armchairs---a monument to Zero. 108 He 
is charred out, is calling vengeance on Jews, 109 he 
is old and charred. He has been many-born. 110 Blinks 
in the fire-world, sees started birds 111 blinked red and 
black, the wing a dark log burning 112 against the 
sun; flashes of cypress and swamps, 113 a watery forest 
of red birds. 114 Goes down 115 his altering ash 
smothers the shock of peace, 116 he carried flame 117 
but selling-out is not a dramatic moment, 118 it is 
the chain of memories parasite, 119 the thin flame of 
existence travelling down 120 until the yellow and alizarin red 
121 flares out. The whole of any life, he said, 
122 is always unmistakably one thing. 123 And a dream-voice 
said Freiheit 124 a crackling globe flew down 125 fire 
and punishment, returning grace; 126 vortex of parable through modes 
of life 127 simple and imperceptible transitions 128 in countries 
of transition giving other lives 129 the long remorseless logic 
of their love.
