1 To follow the hard sunlight on the northern harbor 
2 Into the glint, choppy waves off the breakwater 3 
Where a wife and son and a few frozen newsmen 
4 Wait after headwinds. 5 Between the little flags, the 
son of the public man 6 Runs to the float, 
while in the middle distance 7 The wife of the 
public man and the photographers 8 Wait at the windows. 
9 Others wait. Words wait. The memory in craters 10 
Among the unanswered fires, fire's ancestor, 11 Power without dominion, 
to which I testify 12 In word waking and dreaming. 
13 Power flaking in light down avalanches 14 Of all 
their words and faces, days after sleeplessness 15 Where one 
man, fed on sleep and food, loved by women 16 
May voyage and wait for past defeat.
