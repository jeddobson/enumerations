1 Now green, now burning, I make a way for 
peace. 2 After the green and long beyond my lake, 
3 among those fields of people, on these illuminated 4 
hills, gold, burnt gold, spilled gold and shadowed blue, 5 
the light of enormous flame, the flowing light of the 
sea, 6 where all the lights and nights are reconciled. 
7 The sea at last, where all the waters lead. 
8 And all the wars to this peace. 9 For 
the sea does not lie like the death you imagine; 
10 this sea is the real sea, here it is. 
11 This is the living. This peace is the face 
of the world, 12 a fierce angel who in one 
lifetime lives 13 fighting a lifetime, dying as we all 
die, 14 becoming forever, the continual god. 15 Years of 
our time, this heart! The binding of the alone, 16 
bells of all loneliness, binding our lands and our music, 
17 branches full of motion each opening its own flower, 
18 lands of all song, each speaking in his own 
voice. 19 Praise in every grace 20 among the old 
same war. 21 Years of betrayal, million death breeding its 
weaknesses 22 and hope, buried more deep more black than 
dream. 23 Every elegy is the present : freedom eating 
our hearts, 24 death and explosion, and the world unbegun. 
25 Now burning and unbegun, I sing earth with its 
war, 26 and God the future, and the wish of 
man. 27 Though you die, your war lives : the 
years fought it, 28 fusing a dead world straight. 29 
The living will be giving you your meanings, 30 widening 
to love because of the love of man. 31 All 
the wounds crying 32 I feare, and hope : I 
burne, and frese like yse ... 33 saying to the 
beloved 34 For your sake I love cities, 35 on 
your love I love the many, 36 saying to the 
people, 37 for your sake I love the world. 38 
The old wounds crying 39 I find no peace, and 
all my warres are done. 40 Out of our life 
the living eyes 41 See peace in our own image 
made, 42 Able to give only what we can give: 
43 Bearing two days like midnight. "Live," 44 The moment 
offers; the night requires 45 Promise effort love and praise. 
46 Now there are no maps and no magicians. 47 
No prophets but the young prophet, the sense of the 
world. 48 The gift of our time, the world to 
be discovered. 49 All the continents giving off their several 
lights, 50 the one sea, and the air. And all 
things glow. 51 Move as this sea moves, as water, 
as force. 52 Peace shines from its life, its war 
can become 53 at any moment the fierce shining of 
peace, 54 and all the life-night long many voices are 
saying 55 The name of all things is Glowing. 56 
A beginning, a moment of rest that imagines. 57 And 
again I go wandering far and alone, 58 I rise 
at night, I start up in the silence--- 59 lovely 
and silver-black the night remembers. 60 In the cities of 
America I make my peace; 61 among the bombs and 
commands, 62 the sound that war makes 63 NO NO 
64 We see their weeping and their lifetime dreams. 65 
All this, they say to us, because of you. 66 
Much to begin. Now be your green, your burning, 67 
bear also our joy, come to our meeting-place 68 and 
in the triumph of the reconceived 69 lie down at 
last together face to face. 70 We tell beginnings : 
for the flesh and answer, 71 for the look, the 
lake in the eye that knows, 72 for the despair 
that flows down in widest rivers, 73 cloud of home; 
and also the green tree of grace, 74 all in 
the leaf, in the love that gives us ourselves. 75 
The word of nourishment passes through the women, 76 soldiers 
and orchards rooted in constellations, 77 white towers, eyes of 
children: 78 saying in time of war What shall we 
feed? 79 I cannot say the end. 80 Nourish beginnings, 
let us nourish beginnings. 81 Not all things are blest, 
but the 82 seeds of all things are blest. 83 
The blessing is in the seed. 84 This moment, this 
seed, this wave of the sea, this look, this 85 
instant of love. 86 Years over wars and an imagining 
of peace. Or the 87 expiation journey 88 toward peace 
which is many wishes flaming together, 89 fierce pure life, 
the many-living home. 90 Love that gives us ourselves, in 
the world known to all 91 new techniques for the 
healing of a wound, 92 and the unknown world. One 
life, or the faring stars.
