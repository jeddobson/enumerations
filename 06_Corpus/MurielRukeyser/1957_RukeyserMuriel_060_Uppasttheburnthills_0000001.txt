1 Up past the burnt hills. Distance and the crowd, 
2 The track, development, the tracks on their light-gray crystal, 
3 The knotless, nodeless line. Struck into water-light. 4 No 
but knotted, cloved, notched, scarred, traveled brightened 5 by tears, 
6 Good steel rails and riding them 7 Development riding 
on the tracks of law. 8 North in a ravel 
of cloud, into 9 The dappled pass south of the 
city. 10 Mist flowing over toward San Francisco 11 The 
power towers walking, Spaniards' ghosts, 12 The silver-white unborn.
