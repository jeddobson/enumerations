1 Radio silence of aircraft over the dense ocean, 2 
The American silence within our flood of sound. 3 You 
know that our speed over the clouds of ocean 4 
Cannot approach the cry of a burning city. 5 You 
know that this cry arriving is only our own speed 
6 Screaming its own pleasures and names, in flying. 7 
Among this high air only the rage of speed 8 
Can reach us. How can one child saying Mother? 9 
How can these bone-cold naked men, standing all day 10 
And then forced to sing and then to dig their 
graves? 11 I hear the grating of shovels. Or is 
the wind of day? 12 Or songs from all Europe 
and Asia in the smoke of Poland? 13 Here the 
propeller drifts into a rising high tight 14 Strong infant's 
cry in China, under gongs. Noises of flapping. 15 And 
the squeaks and grincing of barbed wire knotted tight. 16 
Slower than steps, the tentative walk on the ghetto pavement. 
17 No bones could go so slow as these slow 
swollen children. 18 They cover their eyes. Their mouths. You 
cannot hear their 19 cries. 20 This is the missile 
waste, all agony, famine, a child deciding 21 That life 
is like this agony that has surrendered its cries. 22 
Sound carrying through sound. 23 Alive, awake, or with all 
their veins broken, 24 Waves of their cry to us 
: Make, for we may not make.
