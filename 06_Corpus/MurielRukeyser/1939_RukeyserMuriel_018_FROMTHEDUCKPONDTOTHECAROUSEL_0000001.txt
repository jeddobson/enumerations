1 Playing a phonograph record of a windy morning 2 
you gay you imitation summer 3 let's see you slice 
up the Park 4 in green from the lake drawn 
bright in silver salt 5 while the little girl playing 
(in iodine and pink) 6 tosses her crumbs and they 
all rise to catch 7 lifting up their white and 
saying Quack. 8 O you pastoral lighting what are you 
getting away with? 9 Wound-up lovers fidgeting balloons and a 
popsicle man 10 running up the road on the first 
day of spring. 11 And the baby carriages whose nurses 
with flat heels 12 (for sufferance is the badge of 
all their tribe) 13 mark turning sunlight on far avenues 
14 etch beacons on the grass. You strenuous baby 15 
rushing up to the wooden horses 16 with their stiff 
necks, their eyes, 17 and all their music! 18 Fountains! 
sheepfolds! merry-go-round! 19 The seal that barking slips Pacifics dark- 
20 diving into his well until up! with a fish! 
21 The tiglon resembling his Siberian sire, 22 ice-cream and 
terraces and twelve o'clock. 23 O mister with the attractive 
moustache, 24 How does it happen to be you? 25 
Mademoiselle in cinnamon zoo, 26 Hello, hello.
