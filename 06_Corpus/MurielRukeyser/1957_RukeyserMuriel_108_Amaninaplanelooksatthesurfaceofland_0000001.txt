1 A man in a plane looks at the surface 
of land. 2 Down, he stares down; he sees the 
narrow papers, 3 His information on China and the book 
about China; 4 He sees his legs and his feet; 
he sees his hands; they are still. 5 Far down 
air crumpled, old ranges, the green of the silk route. 
6 You cannot know, you cannot share, this land, the 
papers say to him 7 Or the last country or 
the ones before. And do you know your 8 land? 
9 You on your ignorant journey. He sees : It 
is my journey. 10 He sees that he does not 
know. But the voices blow through him. 11 He sees 
that he has not spoken. But the voices are here. 
12 The world not beneath him, however sheer he flies. 
The world 13 Around him and through him always. O 
to be home, now. 14 He stretches, a big man 
in a plane. Home, he thinks. I am not 15 
great enough. 16 I wish I were home. Before the 
voices speak, 17 Any of the voices, he knows. He 
surely knows: 18 The journey is my home.
