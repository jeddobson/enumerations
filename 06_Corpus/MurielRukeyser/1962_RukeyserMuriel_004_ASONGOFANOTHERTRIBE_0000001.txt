1 Guilt said the bony man 2 Do you feel 
guilt 3 At your desires? 4 No I said my 
guilt comes when 5 My desires find no way. 6 
Country of sand and claws; 7 I wait for my 
rescuer. 8 No one will venture there 9 Out of 
long silences 10 Come I to wordless song 11 O 
let my singing bring me 12 To that place 13 
Where live waters 14 Rise and go. 15 There may 
the living arrive, 16 Go and return. 17 Find me, 
and I find, 18 And go finding. 19 A beating 
sound, I hear 20 A sound of riding. 21 Speed 
after silence 22 And at last music. 23 Words of 
another tribe: 24 My riding is on swift mares. 25 
My love is by the green water-springs; 26 For a 
short moment I will sit there, 27 I will look 
upon her wandering face, 28 I will put an end 
to the black delay.
