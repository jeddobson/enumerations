1 The motive of all of it was loneliness, 2 
All the panic encounters and despair 3 Were bred in 
fear of the lost night, apart, 4 Outlined by pain, 
alone. Promiscuous 5 As mercy. Fear-led and led again to 
fear 6 At evening toward the cave where part fire, 
part 7 Pity lived in that voluptuousness 8 To end 
one and begin another loneliness. 9 This is the most 
intolerable motive : this 10 Must be given back to 
life again, 11 Made superhuman, made human, out of pain 
12 Turned to the personal, the pure release: 13 The 
rings of Plato and Homer's golden chain 14 Or Lenin 
with his cry of Dare We Win.
