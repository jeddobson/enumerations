65 Walk down the streets that lead to school. 66 
Study, h'p! Pause, h'p! Recess, h'p! 67 I want to 
grow up. 68 Can you be direct as snow, straight 
to the face? 69 When the ball arrives, catch it! 
Who loves you? 70 What's around you and under you, 
71 who bends above you? 72 Immortal is miles away, 
and age. 73 And Europe. But not so the sea. 
74 The sea is near, mother and father near. 75 
Not with the dirty children, dear. 76 Not to look 
at the sea. 77 Quiet, music is playing! Never move 
your face. 78 Wear a mask if your face moves 
with your 79 love or anger moving. God first, then 
us. 80 Friday candles. Never discuss. 81 See the full 
street---the war is over! 82 The birdcage swung open to 
the storm. 83 Do not love so much. Keep cool. 
84 Keep collected. Keep warm. 85 "And the harsh friend, 
pushing away the music." 86 The sand-pit high with money. 
The limousine. 87 The chauffeur filling the frost with suicide 
88 smelling sick in garage. First strikers seen. 89 Death 
first, the stiff knees pointing up, gone breath. 90 "And 
the harsh lover: suddenly magic, making 91 me forget mother, 
sob through shut teeth, seeing 92 the kiss full on 
the palm erase the touch of death." 93 What's over 
us? The fancy snowfall. War. 94 What's at our hand 
for truth? The curious windlass 95 going into the well. 
Quaint. Why do those men parade? 96 What's after sitting 
at the window, reading? 97 Lying hot in the bath, 
weeping at night? 98 Going to bed at night and 
at last sleeping?60 What's over England? A cloud. What's over 
France? A flame. 61 And over New York? The night. 
62 Night is nameless, night has no name.63 The crane 
leans down to drink the pit. 64 Look from the 
blackboard out the window. 65 Walk down the streets that 
lead to school. 66 Study, h'p! Pause, h'p! Recess, h'p!

99 Give a dime to a beggar for I have 
seen a sight 100 children grown tall and tragic reason 
slight 101 charity dealt the poor again 102 I drove 
with my last love last night 103 through Clinton Street 
where sick, sick, sick 104 the pushcarts screened with oranges 
105 staggering avenues of brick 106 and wealth and love 
were long away 107 and this man wished the old 
love quick. 108 Give more and get your dollars back 
all dimes 109 small change of love: so lied, and 
kissed him tight. 110 I saw his tired body gone 
to crust 111 and chuckling pigeons take him in their 
throats. 112 ---Now see us older, foolish, refugee, 113 the 
child awake with an advertising look 114 gathering speed in 
motors, love in dimes--- 115 what's after driving at night, 
answering joylessly? 116 The wasted pity. Thieving charity. II. 117 
With those two I went driving in the dark, 118 
out from our town in a borrowed car whose light 
119 ate forests as we drove deeper into the park. 
120 Beloved, spoke the sweet equivocal night--- 121 those two 
stood clapped, each breast warmly on breast, 122 I stood 
apart to remove them from my sight : 123 The 
creased brook ran in continual unrest, 124 rising to seastorm 
in the rioting mind. 125 Here night and they and 
I---and who was merriest? 126 He turned his face away 
refusing, and so signed 127 for her to stop who 
too was comfortless 128 and equally needy, as tender and 
as blind. 129 On the road to the city stood 
the hedge whose darkness 130 had covered me months ago 
with that tall stranger 131 as foreign to me as 
this loneliness, 132 as enemy to me as tonight's anger 
133 of grief in the country, shut with those two 
in the park: 134 this crying, frantic at removal, the 
dark, the sorrowful 135 danger. III. 136 Watching, on piers, 
exuberant travellers 137 enter the ocean where the beggar sits 
138 desperate at exclusive waterfronts, 139 see how the feasted 
boat leaves port 140 covered with singing birds. 141 Cruising 
to cellophane islands, shaking off 142 this city's rock providing 
lonely tours, 143 grim single passports, persevering winter, 144 the 
ship slides down midnight's imperious harbor 145 The gilt-tiered galleries 
awake and dance. 146 What is it rippling across the
