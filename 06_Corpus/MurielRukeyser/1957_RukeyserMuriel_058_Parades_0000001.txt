1 Parades. Rattle of palm trees. The silver planes. 2 
Statues : Prometheus and General Otis. 3 Searchlights demanding. 4 
This is the journey into the people, asking for consent, 
for 5 sanction, for belief. 6 Concrete parades, stabbings and 
fortunetelling, 7 Gin, roughage, the studios on Christmas Eve, spotlit 
groceries 8 and the prayer marathon. 9 The rose window 
copied from Rheims, the Aztec temple designed 10 by the 
architect who believes in function. 11 Great ancient lizards and 
tar pits, the skeletons of pale fine starlets, 12 Some 
Rembrandts, a cafeteria (white tile and potassium broth) 13 Where 
you pay what you think the meal was worth. 14 
The Strip, the Bowl, the Derby, the Easter Cross, 15 
The Troc, the Wee Kirk; the neon in the graveyard, 
16 Saying on and off, Father. On and off. On 
and off. 17 The oil well in the sea.
