1 In the full sun. In the fruitfall season. 2 
Against my knees the earth and the bucket, and the 
soft blue 3 prunes 4 echoing red echoing purple echoing 
in the silver bucket 5 sun, and over the flames 
of earth the sun flies down. 6 Over my head 
the little trees tremble alive in their black 7 branches 
8 and bare-ribbed boys golden and shouting stoop here to 
gather 9 the blue, 10 the wild-red, the dark. Colors 
of ripeness in the fruitfall 11 season. 12 I will 
remember the last light on the lowest branch. 13 Will 
see these trees as they were in spring, wild black 
rooted in 14 light, 15 root-deep in noon, the piercing 
yellow noon of mustard- 16 blossom. 17 Sun breathing on 
us the scent of heat, richness of air where my 
18 hands know 19 blue, full summer, strong sun. I 
tell you harvest.
