for Naginski 1 In the last bus last night that 
dead musician 2 Rode, I saw him riding, all his 
orchestras 3 Lost past belief and under Egypt plowed 4 
By rusty knives, the noise-machines of grief. 5 Thunder of 
the senses died, 6 Stabbed in their singing by a 
sleepwalker. 7 You were the man in whose voices the 
green leaf 8 Of form was singing, the bird riding 
the cloud. 9 Minotaur underwater in the cedar lake, 10 
Naginski, you are your own exile of music. 11 There 
were three roads going through that whole land: 12 The 
bird's, the bed's, or suicide. 13 He meant to drown 
his self. He drowned his life. 14 Silence lay down 
fanatically straight. 15 I am your exile, he sang from 
his dead mouth, 16 From the water-maze reaching out his 
hand and one green leaf.
