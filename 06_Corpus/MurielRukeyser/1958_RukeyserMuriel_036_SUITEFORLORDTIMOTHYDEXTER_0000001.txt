nailhead proverbs. 3 The sun still pouring all male all 
female through their blood 4 And away through the salt 
marsh and the white salt sand 5 Sea-blaze over their 
shoulders, fantasy 6 A blue invisible mountain up whose side 
7 Laughter and sharp clouds race as he saw them 
ride 8 In witness when he as a boy walked 
down 9 With morning for a sign. 10 Smelling of 
acid, like his trade. 11 Ready to throw their lifeday 
down their throats like wine, 12 Death-rotten proverbs and the 
jokes all made, 13 Himself the wine-bottle burning in the 
sun. 14 More here than power over proverbs. But that 
power pours 15 here 16 And the sure sun of 
story, on top the live gold mast. 17 What's strong, 
what's lost? What boy walked salty in the light? 18 
A raging worshipping fantastic man, 19 Tasting money and words, 
live-breasted women, 20 The tanner's boy streaked with truth. In 
the young States 21 He saw young morning. Wild he 
was. 22 And most 23 A clap of mockery clean 
in the sea-brightness, 24 A legend of this coast.1 They

but 26 Nothing's the same. 27 Now King-No-More knows 28 
Lady-No-More; 29 There may be shame but 30 He's Mr. 
Guilt, and 31 Hell is Mr. War. 32 The wooden 
golden eagle 33 Announces from the rooftree: 34 Miss Equal, 
Mr. E., 35 Dr. and Mrs. Eden, and 36 I 
am Miss Liberty. 37 But we see Timothy, 1 38 
No more the colonized, 39 Look around after labor. 40 
Not a single neighbor 41 Gives him his due acclaim. 
42 Timothy's surprised: 43 A harsh laugh, a short knife, 
44 Started his prodigious life. 45 But he took hold 
of fate, 46 Invested in the State, with 47 Money 
not worth a damn. 48 "I," he said, "am what 
I am, 49 What's to be done will be done, 
50 The capital will be Washington. 51 Mr. Hamilton keeps 
his word, 52 This country's bond's as sound as me, 
53 Timothy. 54 What 'dyou say? 55 'Sound as I'---? 
56 Very well; me is I, 57 I the tree 
58 Flourishing." 59 Mr. Hamilton truly meant 60 An almost 
infinite per cent 61 Would accrue 62 Quickly to 63 
The trustful and the nourishing. 64 The newborn Federal bank 
has stirred. 2 65 Timothy is a sword. 66 A 
sword without blessing, 67 A sword without fame, 68 A 
sword bearing no signal name. 69 If Newburyport 70 Will 
be blind, 71 Will seem bored, 72 Never mind. 73 
New Hampshire's kind, and 74 Calls him "Lord." 3 75 
Apprentice then, on the road 76 Next day wore his 
freedom suit, 77 Brided widow and won his house, 78 
Ground their proverbs underfoot. 79 A poor boy made and 
found 80 And funding came to his own tune. 81 
"Lord" is the center of that sound, 82 And all 
the songs proclaim 83 He is the bright blue morning 
rhyme, 84 A great name rides before his name. 85 
Turn, burn, and overturn! 86 Among the squarest houses, he 
87 Is more than Timothy, 88 And more than merry. 
89 Can forever now retort 90 Very much Newbury- 91 
Port: 92 The voice of the people and I can't 
help it, 93 But all's easy and no bones broken, 
94 All is well, all in Love. 95 The first 
Lord of the age has spoken. 96 Now all the 
torment Massachusetts bore 97 Triumphs in a blaze of love. 
98 Love, love, fantasy, 99 For 100 Out of shame 
and poverty, 101 From oppression, commerce, war, 102 Rose a 
new sovereignty: 103 The states are free and trade is 
free 104 And Dexter's Lord Timothy.25 A name's a name
