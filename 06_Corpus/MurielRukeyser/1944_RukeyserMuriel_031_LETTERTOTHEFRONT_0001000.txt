how war came, I wake and think of you, 115 
In the city of water and stone where I was 
born, 116 My home of complex light. What we were 
fighting for, 117 In the beginning, in Spain, was not 
to be defined. 118 More human than abstract, more direction 
than end. 119 Terror arrived intact, lit with the tragic 
fire 120 Of hope before its time, tore us from 
lover and friend. 121 We came to the violent act 
with all that we had learned. 122 But now we 
are that home you dream across a war. 123 You 
fight; and we must go in poetry and hope 124 
Moving into the future that no one can escape. 125 
Peace will in time arrive, but war defined our years. 
126 We are like that young saint at the spring 
who bent 127 Her face over dry earth the vision 
told her flowed, 128 Miring herself. She knew it was 
water. But for 129 Herself, it was filth. Later, for 
all to come 130 Following her faith, miraculous crystal ran. 
131 O saint, O poet, O wounded of these wars 
132 To find life flowing from the heart of man. 
133 We hold belief. You fight and are maimed and 
mad. 134 We believe, though all you want be bed 
with one 135 Whose mouth is bread and wine, whose 
flesh is home.136 To be a Jew in the twentieth 
century 137 Is to be offered a gift. If you 
refuse, 138 Wishing to be invisible, you choose 139 Death 
of the spirit, the stone insanity. 140 Accepting, take full 
life. Full agonies: 141 Your evening deep in labyrinthine blood 
142 Of those who resist, fail, and resist; and God 
143 Reduced to a hostage among hostages. 144 The gift 
is torment. Not alone the still 145 Torture, isolation; or 
torture of the flesh. 146 That may come also. But 
the accepting wish, 147 The whole and fertile spirit as 
guarantee 148 For every human freedom, suffering to be free, 
149 Daring to live for the impossible.150 Evening, bringing me 
out of the government building, 151 Spills her blue air, 
her great Atlantic clouds 152 Over my hair, reminds me 
of my land. 153 My back to high stone and 
that man's golden bands 154 Who said of our time 
which has only its freedom, 155 "I will not ever 
say 'for a free world,' 156 'A better world' or 
whatever it is; 157 A man fights to win a 
war, 158 To hang on to what is his---" 159 
Consider this man in the clothes of a commander. 160 
Remember that his field is bottled fizz. 161 O the 
blue air and the nightsound of heartbeats--- 162 Planes or 
poems or dreams direct as prayer. 163 The belief in 
the world, and we can stand with them, 164 Whoever 
clearly fights the order of despair. 165 In spite of 
the fascist, Malicioso King, 166 Contractor, business man and publisher, 
167 Who will hire a man to hire another man 
168 To hire someone to murder the man of strong 
belief. 169 Look at him at the Radio City bar; 
170 Remember that he functions best as thief. 171 O 
the clouds and the towers are not enough to hide 
172 The little sneer at freedom, the whisper that art 
died. 173 Here is the man who changed his name, 
the man who dyed his 174 hair; 175 One praises 
only his own birth; one only his own whore. 176 
Unable to create or fight or commit suicide, 177 Will 
make a job of weakness, be the impotent editor, 178 
The sad and pathic bull always wishing he were 179 
The bullfighter. But we remember the changes that he made, 
180 Screaming "Betrayed!" He forever betrays. He alone is 181 
betrayed. 182 They are all here in this divided time: 
183 Dies the inquisitor against the truth, 184 Wheeler, Nye, 
Pegler, Hearst, each with his crews, 185 McCormick, the Representatives 
whose crime 186 Is against history, the state, and love. 
187 I hold their dead skulls in my hand; this 
death 188 Worked against labor, women, Jews, 189 Reds, Negroes. 
But our freedom lives 190 To fight the war the 
world must win. 191 The fevers of confusion's touch 192 
Leap to confusion in the land. 193 We shall grow 
and fight again. 194 The sickness of our divided state 
195 Calls to the anger and the great 196 Imaginative 
gifts of man. 197 The enemy does his rigid work. 
198 We live fighting in that dark. 199 Let all 
the living fight in proof 200 They start the world 
this war must win.201 Among all the waste there are 
the intense stories 202 And tellers of stories. One saw 
a peasant die. 203 One guarded a soldier through disease. 
And one 204 Saw all the women look at each 
other in hope. 205 And came back, saying, "All things 
must be known." 206 They come home to the rat-faced 
investigator 207 Who sneers and asks, "Who is your favorite 
poet?" 208 Voices of scissors and grinders asking their questions: 
209 "How did you ever happen to be against fascism?" 
210 And they remember the general's white hair, 211 The 
food-administrator, alone and full of tears. 212 They come home 
to the powder-plant at twilight, 213 The girls emerging like 
discolored shadows. 214 But this is a land where there 
is time, and time; 215 This is the country where 
there is time for thinking. 216 "Is he a 'fellow-traveler'?--- 
No. ---Are you sure? ---No." 217 The fear. Voices of 
clawhammers and spikes clinking. 218 If they bomb the cities, 
they must offer the choice. 219 Taking away the sons, 
they must create a reason. 220 The cities and women 
cry in a frightful voice, 221 "I care not who 
makes the laws, let me make the sons." 222 But 
look at their eyes, like drinking animals' 223 Full of
