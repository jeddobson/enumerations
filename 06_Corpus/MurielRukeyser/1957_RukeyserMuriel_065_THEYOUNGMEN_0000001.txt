1 The surface shine, the inner steel of track 2 
Carry September ringing to a boy 3 Miles down and 
decades past, a maroon sweater 4 Haunting a plexus of 
rails. 5 A spur leading nowhere. 6 And silos, like 
ill-launched rockets, hurling tall 7 Such faulty upright weight five 
miles downtrack 8 As feeds the colored cattle, as feeds 
the governor, 9 As feeds the party wheelhorse as feeds 
me. 10 Ascending ties, a hymn of ladders. Colder. 11 
I urge my wretched urgings clamber out, 12 Holding the 
frozen ironwork. 13 Coldbitten indecent lavender and white, 14 The 
naked noses and naked stares recede. 15 I hear the 
patching words that ring like coin 16 Behind the platform, 
my penny monument. 17 At a certain moment the railway 
forfeits metal, 18 Speed seizes this track, we are going 
fast. 19 The calendar's contagions, days, declarations, 20 Flaunted away 
on a Hollywood montage. 21 There must be a darkened 
third-run movie house 22 Behind that ice-clad coalyard where they 
show 23 Quiet. A willow. Some hammock-pampered girl 24 In 
a Middle Western college; pipedreams of reassurance 25 And a 
low speaking voice. 26 Waterfalls 27 Narrow, behind me. 28 
All the American rivers 29 Controlled into metal systems, 30 
Narrow as rails. 31 Firing down endless, successful rapids, 32 
The tiny inconspicuous steely rapids 33 This train, my dragon, 
a Cherokee canoe 34 Clipping back birchbark over carbon paper 
35 Pouring the smoke of my statement, 36 Tobacco that 
is the barn-hung skins of prophets 37 Pouring smoke out, 
that hardens into scars. 38 Effigy and belief! The track 
flattening south, 39 Splits from before backward, far into silver, 
40 Opening into the small lost villages. 41 Sidings of 
young men propped against sycamores, 42 With eighteen miles between 
any two of them. 43 Their hopes are hanging three 
feet above their eyes; 44 Their girls away at a 
dance; all their big powers 45 Lifted up, and alone. 
46 Lost villages, my frontier; our crest and crown; 47 
My brothers who will never vote for me. 48 My 
lost self who will never vote for me.
