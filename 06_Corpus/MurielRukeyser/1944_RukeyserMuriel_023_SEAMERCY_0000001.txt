1 The sea dances its morning 2 On my enlightened 
bones, 3 Stones of the lip-warm land 4 Clap my 
awakening. 5 The land is partly lost, 6 The sea 
is all water, 7 Half horror and half blue 8 
Shaking its appetites 9 Among my senses. 10 History has 
commanded 11 All the rivers--- 12 A ship entered the 
bay 13 And the sky sailed in. 14 The twentieth 
century 15 Stares from the high air--- 16 The skin 
of the land 17 Is shallow and very green 18 
But the sea the sea 19 Is still, the deep 
scene 20 Contains the unbroken 21 Tides of man. 22 
Horror is appetite, 23 Hell is lonely, 24 War's a 
breath. 25 Wake us you black 26 You white you 
water. 27 The scream of the gull: 28 Land's too 
shallow 29 Life's a breath 30 Sea mercy. 31 Worms 
be my carnival 32 Who cries there is no death?
