clear on the radio into my room 139 out of 
blazing Belfast. 140 Long enough for me to walk around 
141 in that strong voice.142 He speaks in a big 
voice through all the air 143 saying : we have 
made strength, 144 we have made a beginning, 145 we 
will have lasting peace. 146 Something shouts on the river. 
147 All night long the acts speak: 148 the new 
laser bomb falls impeccably 149 along the beam of a 
strict light 150 finding inevitably a narrow footbridge 151 in 
Asia.152 What did I miss as I went searching? 153 
What did I not see? 154 I renounce all this 
regret. 155 Now I will make another try. 156 One 
step and I am free. 157 When it happens to 
us again and again, 158 sometimes we know it for 
we are prepared 159 but to discover, to live at 
the edge of things, 160 to fall out of routine 
into invention 161 and recognize at the other edge of 
ocean 162 a new kind of man a new kind 
of woman 163 walking toward me into the little surf. 
164 This is the next me and the next child 
165 daybreak in continual creation. 166 Dayray we see, we 
say, 167 we sing what we don't see. 168 Picasso 
saying : I don't search, I find! 169 And in 
us our need, the traces of the future, 170 the 
egg and its becoming. 171 I come to you searching 
and searching.172 After this crisis, 173 nothing being conquered, 174 
the theme is set: 175 to move with the forces, 
176 how to go on 177 from the moment that 
178 changed our life, 179 the moment of revelation, 180 
proceeding from the crisis, 181 from the dream, 182 and 
not from the moment 183 of sleep before it?184 Searching/not 
searching. To make closeness. 185 For if this communication was 
the truth, 186 then it was this communiation itself 187 
which was the value to be supported. 188 And for 
this communication to endure, 189 men and women must move 
freely. And to make 190 this communication renew itself always 
191 we must renew justice. 192 And to make this 
communication 193 lasting, we must live to eliminate 194 violence 
and the lie. 195 Yes, we set the communication 196 
we have achieved 197 against the world of murder. 198 
Searching/not searching. after Camus, 1946199 What did I see? What 
did I not see? 200 The river flowing past my 
window. 201 The night-lit city. My white pointed light. 202 
Pieces of world away 203 within my room. 204 Unseen 
and seen, the bodies within my life. 205 Voices under 
the leaves of Asia, 206 and America, in sex, in 
possibility. 207 We are trying to make, to let our 
closeness be made, 208 not torn apart tonight by our 
dead skills. 209 The shadow of my hand. 210 The 
shadow of the pen. 211 Morning of the day we 
reach or do not reach. 212 In our bodies, we 
find each other. 213 On our mouths, inner greet, 214 
in our eyes.
