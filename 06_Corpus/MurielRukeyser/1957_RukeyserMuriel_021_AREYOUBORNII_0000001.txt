1 A child riding the stormy mane of noon 2 
Sang to me past the cloud of the world: 3 
Are you born? Are you born? 4 The form of 
this hope is the law of all things, 5 Our 
foaming sun is the toy of that force. 6 Touch 
us alive, developing light! Today, 7 Revealed over the mountains, 
every living eyes. 8 Child of the possible, who rides 
the hour 9 Of dream and process, lit by every 
fire. 10 Glittering blood of song, a man who changed 
11 And hardly changed, only flickered, letting pass 12 A 
glint of time, showers of human meanings 13 Flashing upon 
us all : his story and his song. 14 The 
song of a child; the song of the cloud of 
the world, 15 Born, born, born. Cloud became real, 16 
and change, 17 The starry form of love.
