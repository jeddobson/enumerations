for Robert Payne 1 Great Alexander sailing was from his 
true course turned 2 By a young wind from a 
cloud in Asia moving 3 Like a most recognizable most 
silvery woman; 4 Tall Alexander to the island came. 5 
The small breeze blew behind his turning head. 6 He 
walked the foam of ripples into this scene. 7 The 
trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk 8 
Until you look again. Then people and animals 9 Are 
ripening on the branches; the broad leaves 10 Are leaves; 
pale horses, sharp fine foxes 11 Blossom; the red rabbit 
falls 12 Ready and running. The trunk coils, turns, 13 
Snakes, fishes. Now the ripe people fall and run, 14 
Three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand 15 
Where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame. 16 
Stiff Alexander stands. He cannot turn. 17 But he is 
free to turn : this is the speaking tree, 18 
It calls your name. It tells us what we mean.
