1 The brilliant, the full-bodied, the real of the world 
in their powers, 2 The faces of these people always 
with their lights, one face, one 3 face. 4 The 
process being the hero and the song. And the light 
in a 5 face. One darklit voice. 6 One deaf 
musician with his two hundred amens, his endless 7 climbing 
of life, saying "peace" to the trumpets. 8 The singing 
of all the voices, your chance and your choice, 9 
Making your acts 10 And your imaginings. 11 Related to 
finding, whether or not we are found.
