1 Faced with furnace demands during its education, 2 the 
strictest spirit must take them all; it needs 3 to 
break down shame; but gasping into a pillow 4 later 
to nobody anywhere, claims I Love You. 5 It plays 
long tricks 6 upon itself---the stealthy girl locks doors, 7 
the woman listens in single high rooms for music, 8 
hears climbing elevators as the picket walks 9 in a 
dead street before tallest skyscrapers 10 far on the sidewalks; 
11 all horrors enter all beds to purify 12 the 
critical spirit in a city of change, 13 twisted in 
flames, blazing among the secrets, 14 breaking the taut life 
with their harsh I Have You. 15 It burns and 
never speaks 16 only is educated, when it assumes bright 
horror, 17 nourished against the time it hears its name--- 
18 until it is called will stand, witness to fire, 
19 training a flame upward along its vine.
