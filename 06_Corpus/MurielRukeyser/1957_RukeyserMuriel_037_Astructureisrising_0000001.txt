1 A structure is rising. It takes on shape, it 
takes on meaning 2 Where there was formless waste. Go 
down the valley, 3 Eye of creation, sings the voice 
of the girl 4 Through cloverfield. Green water is the 
spring of the year, 5 Jade green in summer; autumn 
bright blue, for winter 6 waterblack. 7 The wall's detail, 
discrimination of blue 8 Standing above the wall, where developing 
water 9 Coils, sheathes, transforms itself turning, into light. 10 
Fusing of images and further change. 11 Fire and music, 
interchangeable. 12 Fusing of flow, dividing and further blue. 13 
There is control here, for all things in relation 14 
Find their offerings and give. A tendency toward life. 15 
The man at peace with his life and its flashing, 
16 A climax forest at peace with its fields. 17 
When the storms come, there is something in us 18 
That has always been ready to greet the storm. 19 
An impulse running through a valley of process 20 Quickens 
the blossoming, whose orange on evening 21 The fiery action 
of men and women emerges. 22 And daughter-stars, daughter-forests of 
our range 23 Dance with the central prince the dance 
of reign. 24 We know the light incarnate, we have 
seen 25 At last that the flashing is our old 
light, and flesh. 26 Under stones, under leaves, under links 
of purpose, 27 Appetite up so tall, the power is 
given 28 Along the hillsides of risk, the spiral dances 
29 Within its own symmetry. But women, but men, but 
women 30 And men in the dances and risks of 
birth 31 In which love and the spirit are reborn. 
32 This also from lightning given and growing power. 33 
Lightning which is the word. The gift and power. Love.
