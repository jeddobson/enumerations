1 I braced the drum to my arm, a flat 
drum, and began to play. 2 He heard me and 
she heard me. I had never seen this drum 3 
before. 4 As I played, weakness went through me; weakness 
left me. 5 I held my arms high, the drum 
and the soft-headed long 6 stick 7 I drummed past 
my tiredness vibrating weakness, past it into 8 music, 9 
As in ragas past exhaustion into the country of all 
music. 10 Held my arms high, became that vibration, drummed 
the 11 sacrifice of my belly. 12 He heard me, 
she heard me, 13 I turned into the infinity figure, 
reaching down into the earth 14 of music with my 
legs at last, 15 Reaching up from the two circles, 
my pelvic sea, 16 mountains and air of breast, with 
my arms up into music 17 At last turned into 
music, drumming on that possessed 18 vibration, 19 Drumming my 
dream.
