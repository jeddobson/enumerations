1 PAUL: You sit there because I like to look 
at you. 2 I would like to live with you. 
3 Why don't you come live with me? 4 This 
little fish went in the water, 5 But there came 
a boat and smack, 6 Killed at once. 7 That 
is the end of my story. 8 Which is a 
love story, Miss Lorence. 9 What do you know about 
love, Miss Lorence? 10 Once upon a time there was 
a big, big, big man. 11 A zero man. 12 
I dreamed about the school and people. 13 Miss Lorence 
was a snowman. 14 I dreamed about me, sleeping in 
a box 15 Because I had no house. 16 And 
we cried. 17 I dreamed about a hundred miles on 
a boat. 18 And the boat went on swimming in 
my head. 19 Wicked witch. Pony. Zero. Clay. 20 All 
my head is gone. 21 Shot off by a gun. 
22 Your head will be gone too 23 If the 
men, the men, the men shoot you. 24 It will 
be too bad when your head is shot off. 25 
You are a dear little baby. 26 Once there was 
a man called Jew 27 And he was chased and 
he was shot 28 And he ran but he was 
shot 29 Wee Willie Winkle. 30 ---Antonia, you are a 
zero. 31 Have you ever "rapping at a window, tapping 
32 at a lock," Miss Lorence? 33 I am a 
quiet little boy because I must be quiet. 34 Come 
sit beside me, Miss Lorence.
