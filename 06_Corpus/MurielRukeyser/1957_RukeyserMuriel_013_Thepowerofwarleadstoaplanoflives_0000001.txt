1 The power of war leads to a plan of 
lives 2 Involving rivers. The many-stated million 3 Human concerns. 
This touches, this gives life 4 To all its forms. 
Now clothe our force, 5 Make it as flexible as 
a man venturing 6 To fend for himself in his 
own enterprise. 7 Now in the unity of all vision, 
unity of the land, the forests 8 and water, 9 
See nature, the nation, as a web of lives 10 
On the earth together, full of their potencies. 11 The 
total unity, reached past images, 12 Reaching past the naming 
of religions. 13 We reach to create. That is our 
central meaning, 14 Suggestion of art and altar in all 
our passwords, 15 For the meaning of "mirror of nature," 
the meaning of "image 16 of God" 17 Is a 
simple fiery meaning : man is to create. 18 Making, 
singing, bring the potential to day.
