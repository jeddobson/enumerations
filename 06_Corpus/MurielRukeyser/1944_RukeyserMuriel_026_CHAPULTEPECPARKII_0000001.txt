1 The city of the heart 2 Is like this 
city. Its names commemorate 3 Beliefs and lovers, books and 
the body's forms. 4 I walk among these avenues whose 
great 5 Names speak of places and saints, revolts and 
flowers. 6 I walk through the night city; walking hear 
a cry 7 Calling, "Slaves demand promises, we need no 
promises, 8 We are free; we promise ourselves a living 
world." 9 Shadows after the lamps, bruise-color and bronze 10 
On the pure walls of midnight. Dark, my brothers, 11 
Where your dark faces watch against a stubborn sky. 12 
Mystical passion, fury, the taste of the world. 13 The 
calling of the world, and everything man fears: 14 Poetry, 
poetry, bravery, poverty, war. 15 And if we weep, it 
is ourselves we weep, 16 Not our belief. But in 
these streets we see 17 The cheapest tourists, the twisted 
cross parade. 18 The city of the heart knows creeping 
fire 19 That beats its towers into storms of flame. 
20 Cynics of power come with their shout of blame, 
21 We wake among the dreams; grace has its ways: 
22 Fire and gleam of blood on stone will fade 
23 Into the moment of proof, blood of our days. 
24 Dawn comes to the city and the spirit's city, 
25 Laughs in the heart like a child, and midday 
flies 26 Over the dogs with their sharp and primitive 
faces 27 Coursing gay and masterless to the zoo. 28 
The live heart laughs and courses and is free, 29 
For the city contains poverty, bravery, war, 30 But most, 
a deepened hope, sunlight and memory.
