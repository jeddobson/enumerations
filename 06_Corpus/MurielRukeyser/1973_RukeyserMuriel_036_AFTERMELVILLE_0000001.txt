1 The sea-coast looks at the sea, and the cities 
pour. 2 The sea pours embassies of music : murder-sonata, 
birth- 3 sonata, 4 the seashore celebrates the deep ocean. 
5 Ocean dreaming all day all night of mountains 6 
lifts a forehead to the wakes of stars; 7 one 
star dives into a still circle : birth, known to 
all. 8 A shore of the sea, one man as 
the shore of the sea; 9 one young man lying 
out over configurations of water 10 never two wave-patterns the 
same, never two same dreamings. 11 He writes these actualities, 
these dreamings, 12 transformed into themselves, his acts, his islands, 
13 his animals ourselves within his full man's hand. 14 
Bitter contempt and bitter poverty, 15 Judaean desert of our 
life, being locked 16 in white in black, a lock 
of essences. 17 Not graves not ocean but ourselves tonight 
18 swing in his knowledge, his living and its wake, 
19 travelling in the sea that goes pouring, dreaming 20 
where we flash in our lifetime wave, these breathing shallows 
21 of a shore that looks at the deep land, 
this island 22 that looks forever at the sea; deep 
sexual sea 23 that breathes one man at the shoreline 
of emergence. 24 He is the sea we carry to 
our star.25 They come into our lives, Melville and Whitman 
who 26 ran contradictions of cities and the one-sparing sea 
27 held in the long male arms --- Identify. 28 
They enter our evenings speaking---Melville and Crane 29 taking the 
wars of our parentage, silence and smoke, 30 tearing the 
live man open till we wake. 31 Emily Dickinson, Melville 
in our breathing, 32 isolate among powers, telling us the 
sea 33 and the slow dance of the absence of 
the sea. 34 Hawthorne whose forehead knew the revelation--- 35 
how can we receive the vision at noonday? 36 Move 
with the revelation? Move away? 37 More violent than Melville 
diving the sea deeper 38 no man has ever gone. 
He swims our world 39 violence and dream safe only 
in full danger. 40 Revealing us, who are his afterlife.41 
A woman looks at the sea. 42 Woman in whose 
waiting is held ocean 43 faces the other sea where 
his life drowns and is saved, 44 recurrent singing, the 
reborn wave. 45 A man looking into the sea. 46 
He sails, he swims among the opposites, 47 diving, making 
a life among many unknowns, 48 he takes for his 
knowledge the future wake of stars. 49 The sea looking 
and not looking. 50 Among the old enemies, a transparent 
lake. 51 Wars of the sea and land, wars of 
air; space; 52 against the corroded wars and sources of 
wars, a lake of 53 being born. 54 A man 
and a woman look into each other. 55 One man 
giving us forever the grapes of the sea. 56 Gives 
us marriage; gives us suicide and birth; he drowns 57 
for the sake of our look into each other's body 
and life. 58 Allowing the great life : sex, time, 
the feeding powers. 59 He is part of our look 
into each other's face.
