1 Forerunners of images. 2 In morning, on the river-mouth, 
3 I came to my waking 4 seeing carried in 
air 5 seaward, a ship. 6 Standing on stillness 7 
before the bowsprit 8 the man of spirit 9 ---lookout 
aloft, steersman at wheel, silence on water--- 10 and the 
young graceful man holding the lily iron. 11 I dream 
of all harpooning and the sea. 12 Out of Seville, 
after Holy Week I heard the 13 story of the 
black carriage and a lordly woman. 14 Her four daughters, 
their skirts of black foam. 15 lace seethed about them; 
drawn by four horses, 16 reined in, their black threads 
in the coachman's hands. 17 Far ahead on invisible wire 
18 a circus horse making his shapes on the air. 
19 Between us forever enlarges Spain and the war. 20 
Far in New Jersey, among split-level houses, 21 behind the 
concrete filling-station I found 22 a yellow building and the 
flags of prayer. 23 Two Tibetans in their saffron bowed, 
priests 24 of their robes, their banners, their powers. 25 
Little Tibetan children playing stickball 26 on the black road. 
27 Day conscious and unconscious. 28 Words on the air. 
29 Before the great 30 images arrive, riderless horses. 31 
Words on an uproar silent hour. 32 In our own 
time.
