1 Deep in the century of opposites, 2 The myth 
of mission is the tourist's dream. 3 He will fly 
over the zebra-colored cliffs, 4 Carrying letters, he lands within 
a war. 5 He is the big enigma and mask 
of power. 6 The fluid desert war and the sea---hieroglyphs 
7 Holding him while he swims with General Fever 8 
Are the response and law of Africa. 9 This is 
the threshold : Spain and Carthage lie 10 Over the 
ocean, but he goes otherwhere. 11 In meteor noon, each 
flaming with its star 12 The shifting and the warring 
pyramids. 13 Egypt is saved, the general said again. 14 
He cannot dream the double fantasy 15 All that the 
batttle has sent us from its fire: 16 The film 
whose heroes are war and the enemy 17 The poem 
in the soldier's Highland tongue: 18 Worse than all Rommel's 
guns, that my young darling should prove false 19 and 
a liar.
