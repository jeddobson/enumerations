1 Horizon of islands shifting 2 Sea-light flame on my 
voice 3 burn in me 4 Light 5 flows from 
the water from sands islands of this horizon 6 The 
sea comes toward me across the sea. The sand 7 
moves over the sand in waves 8 between the guardians 
of this landscape 9 the great commemorative statue on one 
hand 10 ---the first flight of man, outside of dream, 
11 seen as stone wing and stainless steel--- 12 and 
at the other hand 13 banded black-and-white, climbing 14 the 
spiral lighthouse.15 Flood over ocean, 16 avalanche on the flat 
beach. Pouring. 17 Indians holding branches up, to 18 placate 
the tempest, 19 the one-legged twisting god that is 20 
a standing wind. 21 Rays are branching from all things: 
22 great serpent, great plume, constellation: 23 sands from which 
colors and light pass, 24 the lives of plants. Animals. 
Men. 25 A man and a woman reach for each 
other.26 Wave of the sea.27 Sands have washed, sea has 
flown over us. 28 Between the two guardians, spiral, truncated 
wing, 29 history and these wild birds 30 Bird-voiced discoverers 
: Hariot, Hart Crane, 31 the brothers who watched gulls. 
32 "No bird soars in a calm," said Wilbur Wright. 
33 Dragon of the winds forms over me. 34 Your 
dance, goddesses in your circle 35 sea-wreath, whirling of the 
event 36 behind me on land as deep in our 
own lives 37 we begin to know the movement to 
come. 38 Sunken, drowned spirals, 39 hurricane-dance.40 Shifting of islands 
on this horizon. 41 The cycle of changes in the 
Book of Changes. 42 Two islands making an open female 
line. 43 That powerful long straight bar a male island. 
44 The building of the surf 45 constructing immensities 46 
between the pale flat Sound 47 and ocean ever 48 
birds as before earthquake 49 winds fly from all origins 
50 the length of this wave goes from the great 
wing 51 down coast, the barrier beach in all its 
miles 52 road of the sun and the moon to 
53 a spiral lighthouse 54 to the depth turbulence 55 
lifts up its wave like cities 56 the ocean in 
the air 57 spills down the world.58 A man is 
walking toward me across the water. 59 From far out, 
the flat waters of the Sound, 60 he walks pulling 
his small boat 61 In the shoal water. 62 A 
man who is white and has been fishing. 63 Walks 
steadily upon the light of day 64 Coming closer to 
me where I stand 65 looking into the sun and 
the blaze inner water. 66 Clear factual surface over which 
he pulls 67 a boat over a closing quarter-mile.68 Speak 
to it, says the light. 69 Speak to it music, 
70 voices of the sea and human throats. 71 Origins 
of spirals, 72 the ballad and original sweet grape 73 
dark on the vines near Hatteras, 74 tendrils of those 
vines, whose spiral tower 75 now rears its light, accompanying 
76 all my voices.77 He walks toward me. A black 
man in the sun. 78 He now is a black 
man speaking to my heart 79 crisis of darkness in 
this century 80 of moments of this speech. 81 The 
boat is slowly nearer drawn, this man. 82 The zigzag 
power coming straight, in stones, 83 in arcs, metal, crystal, 
the spiral 84 in sacred wet 85 schematic elements of 
86 cities, music, arrangement 87 spin these stones of home 
88 under the sea 89 return to the stations of 
the stars 90 and the sea, speaking across its lives.91 
A man who is bones is close to me 92 
drawing a boat of bones 93 the sun behind him 
94 is another color of fire, 95 the sea behind 
me 96 rears its flame. 97 A man whose body 
flames and tapers in flame 98 twisted tines of remembrance 
that dissolve 99 a pitchfork of the land worn thin 
100 flame up and dissolve again 101 draw small boat 
102 Nets of the stars at sunset over us. 103 
This draws me home to the home of the wild 
birds 104 long-throated birds of this passage. 105 This is 
the edge of experience, grenzen der seele 106 where those 
on the verge of human understanding 107 the borderline people 
stand on the shifting islands 108 among the drowned stars 
and the tempest. 109 "Everyman's mind, like the dumbest, 110 
claws at his own furthest limits of knowing the world," 
111 a man in a locked room said. 112 Open 
to the sky 113 I stand before this boat that 
looks at me. 114 The man's flames are arms and 
legs. 115 Body, eye, head, stars, sands look at me. 
116 I walk out into the shoal water 117 and 
throw my leg over the wall of the boat.118 At 
one shock, speechlessness. 119 I am in the bow, on 
the short thwart. 120 He is standing before me amidships, 
rowing forward 121 like my old northern sea-captain in his 
dory. 122 All things have spun. 123 The words gone, 
124 I facing sternwards, looking at the gate 125 between 
the barrier islands. As he rows. 126 Sand islands shifting 
and the last of land 127 a pale and open 
line horizon 128 sea. 129 With whose face did he 
look at me? 130 What did I say? or did 
I say? 131 in speechlessness 132 move to the change. 
133 These strokes provide the music, 134 and the accused 
boy on land today saying 135 What did I say? 
or did I say? 136 The dream on land last 
night built this the boat of death 137 but in 
the suffering of the light 138 moving across the sea 
139 do we in our moving 140 move toward life 
or death141 Hurricane, skullface, the sky's size 142 winds streaming 
through his teeth 143 doing the madman's twist 144 and
