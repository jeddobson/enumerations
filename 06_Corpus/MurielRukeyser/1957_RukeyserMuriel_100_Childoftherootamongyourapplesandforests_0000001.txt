1 Child of the root, among your apples and forests, 
2 I see a bird whose gaze and claws are 
fire 3 Fasten upon you. In your shape of becoming, 
4 You and your bird change to a stream of 
water 5 Through whom light pours, to the present breaking 
its banks. 6 A pride of making, that can destroy 
its objects. 7 Looking ahead, to a distant point, 8 
Creation unbegun.
