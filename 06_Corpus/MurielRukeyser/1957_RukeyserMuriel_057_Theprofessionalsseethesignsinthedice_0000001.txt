1 The professionals see the signs in the dice, the 
signs in the cards 2 and clouds, 3 Over their 
drinks they curse at the candidate, a renegade enemy 4 
whose sudden cause 5 Was rammed down their throats; he 
is wrecking their only chance. 6 The Dream of Business 
is a failing image. 7 Among the predictions, statistics, in 
the crowds, 8 The explosive seeds of defeat. Their deadliest 
fears 9 Run damp in their bones. More than torches 
by night, 10 More than pennons, candy, and speechmaking, 11 
A campaign is slavery, they say, 12 The tiring slavery 
: to plan, to counsel, to control. 13 Above all 
: to carry out. 14 Willkie shows courage. Willkie will 
shout. 15 Forthright, alone, he speaks his mind. 16 But 
the party needed another kind--- 17 A man who will 
accept support. 18 No benefit here of party or plan. 
19 Joe Martin sacrificed himself, wanting a giant to fight 
a giant. 20 ---He's not a giant! 21 He draws 
his crowds. 22 Dead whales on flatcars draw their crowds. 
23 Nobody votes for a dead whale.
