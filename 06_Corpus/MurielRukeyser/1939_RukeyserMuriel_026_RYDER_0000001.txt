1 Call himself unbegun, for the sea made him; assemblages 
of 2 waters gave him his color. 3 But not 
the sea; coast-line, coast-water, rising sfumato from 4 smokeholes of 
the sea, 5 pitching onto the black rock of the 
ocean-edge. But not the 6 coastline; 7 the Atlantic coast, 
flinging him headlong from its rigors into 8 his art. 
9 Great salt-swept boldface captain, big-boned New Englander 10 drowning 
deep 11 among the mysteries of the painful western adventure, 
circling 12 in unappeased circles into America. 13 Tempests, phantasmagoria! 
Impervious, first of all 14 to paint the tragic landscape 
that breeds us here, 15 the deep life, the terrible 
foreboding whose soil 16 is in our mind, the imagination 
of this geography. 17 Whose whaling port acknowledges the fearful 
18 content of evil and the swift-lit blessed light, 19 
Melville's 'latent horror of life' in the whale water 20 
that Ryder, whose racecourse with its big horse Death 21 
runs round the brain, knew. 22 In his room 23 
wreckage of boxes, propped-leg, easel, couch, ashes, coal-keg, 24 shells, 
25 bronzed tarnished coffee-pot, books, paints, piled broken 26 furniture, 
27 varnish drippings, matches, cans, newspapers stacked up, 28 plaster 
falling with a scurrying like mice, paper bannering from 29 
the walls, 30 the stains, the path cleared to the 
stuffed chair crammed with 31 poems, 32 money, checks, poems, 
the bathtub filled with clothes--- 33 the unseen room, after 
a moment there. 34 He stood 35 laying the paint 
on 36 stacking color on, 37 more pigment, dark and 
stormy, thickness, depth, more black, 38 stove-ashes maybe, 39 and 
at the last slashed poker through the cloth, a knife 
of 40 lightning, white as space, leaping white! out of 
darkness! 41 Out black night leaping, rider to flame. 42 
He walks through the rainy streets, the great grey sweater; 
43 fog walking through rain, wool worn on his giant 
head, 44 his giant beard stowed in the collar. Walks 
black pavement. 45 Is seen on corners beaten by storms 
of night. 46 He gives a painting to the tubercular 
seamstress 47 "to look at while she lives," talks poetry 
48 and philosophy to the woman at the newsstand. 49 
He believes with his eye, he lives in the foreboding 
50 empty tempests of the mind, thunder revolving 51 among 
his blackest noons; remembers voyages 52 to fabulous harbors whose 
event was sea. 53 He looks through the plateglass window 
at his formal dinner, 54 turns down the street, "I 
have been there," looks through glass 55 at formal painting, 
inch by inch, reaching the corner 56 stands back, "That's 
a fine place." And moves away 57 to mystic reconciliations, 
feeling the world enlarge 58 and never complete itself, a 
bone riding a horse 59 around a track, dead angels 
from the sea resurrected 60 to lend a metaphor of 
waves, to sound the abstract 61 Jonah who rolls under 
a pitch of ocean, 62 knows God with his arms 
up among the teeth of waves, 63 the moon stark 
in the sky as a center of whirlpool. 64 All 
these invoke the image, a sea-belief in the sea 65 
whose waters open swallow the army whole and save the 
tribe. 66 He is your irresponsible pioneer. He is deprived. 
Fearful of 67 sex. Desire, God's blossoming rod 68 points 
to assemblages of waters, heroes Macbeth kneedeep, 69 the foggy 
Dutchman riding, salt eyelids see 70 the fall of waters, 
the distinction and power, the shock, 71 the helplessness immanent 
in things. 72 Ghosts of oxen, stiff-grappled claws of a 
dead bird, 73 romantic wish that mourns from an Opera 
seat 74 over the spotlit love, wishes housekeeper love, 75 
Elaine of wish, bends over an empty big suit of 
armor, 76 over the giant fallen bones of the dead 
horse. 77 Historic disherison : Ryder, emblematist, 78 divorced from 
the arts, believing in art alone, 79 master of meaning 
and never mastering means, 80 wasteful and slow, without tradition. 
He shortens 81 the life of his paintings in their 
friable colors 82 by ignorance, by storms. Refusing the dead 
life 83 like a nest of tables whose next is 
always smaller 84 refined and congruent, slashes American sky 85 
by derelict lightning, turning all landscape into 86 sublunar ocean. 
He is chained under water, 87 chained under rain, under 
paint, no hold on daylight, 88 his fixed moon stares 
into a tragic coast 89 whose people are little figures 
pasted on. 90 "Not you," he cries, "the human document." 
91 These are not paintings for comfort hung on walls. 
92 Paint over it, paint. It is a monument 93 
cracking and supernatural, an obelisk at the sea, 94 three 
sides shadowed with names, the sea-slab empty. 95 A big-boned 
charging figure under rain 96 seen by the visionary moon 
and dark, 97 unbegun among assemblages of waves. 98 His 
head that was moon the center of the storm. 99 
His boulders that were eyes washed by the drift of 
ocean.
