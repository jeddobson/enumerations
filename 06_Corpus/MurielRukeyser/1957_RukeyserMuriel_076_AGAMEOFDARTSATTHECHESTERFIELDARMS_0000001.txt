1 But they are accurate. That is a target. 2 
He throws the first. It looks erect 3 Far from 
the eye, over the whitebreast girl 4 Past thirty years 
of tulip trees. 5 The second makes a ray 6 
Across stupidity. Across his own; 7 Into the edict. Life 
goes here and there 8 Into the land within the 
land, the deeper secret. 9 The throwing of secrets, edged 
and weighted bright. 10 Directness to the mind; the woman 
stumbling home 11 Where there is no home will fall 
again. However. 12 The idiot running under Orion. However. 13 
The flight of birds escapes from your planting. 14 Sharp 
arrows overtake you and go through you 15 And surpass 
you and race with your name into daybreak, 16 And 
all this is your riddle and your game.
