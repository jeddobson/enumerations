1 When the hero of the threshold enters our lives 
and our houses 2 The wish that is most human 
in all of us deepens and feels 3 saved; it 
rises 4 To another level of desire. Himself the man, 
himself the 5 animal, 6 Himself the moment makes new 
the forms, makes our song and our prayer. 7 We 
look at our lives renewed, we have let go of 
the fear 8 That went through the old minutes. Our 
selves begin to speak: 9 "There was curse on his 
house. Or blessing. But there is 10 choice." 11 Say 
of this flier, "A skill has taken possession of the 
man." 12 The young saying Dare, the old Praise air, 
but keep on land. 13 When we see the hero, 
his act seeming accomplished, we wish 14 for him the 
leader's lifetime, 15 The drums being here, the loudspeakers, sharp 
trumpets, 16 acclaim of sunlight; 17 The joy of time 
is the leap forward of a man or a people. 
18 The moment of the leap is ready today. 19 
We look again for the laws of history in the 
hero's face and his 20 lifetime, 21 But it is 
not like that---he has his speech of thanks, his dazzled 
22 smile of sunlight. 23 Our acceptance is flowering and 
sheds on his air triumph. 24 Our delight is the 
herald of certain public voices 25 Arriving to tell us 
as they always tell us 26 Take the act and 
postpone the meanings. 27 In the world of listen and 
touch, shining and sounding, 28 Love and the hero, 29 
God give us each his sin to awaken him. 30 
When in our deep delight we take the gifts of 
the hero 31 We are glad, we become responsible. And 
in an age at war, 32 Dead power, the lying 
opposites, the great cities fighting in the air, 33 We 
think of flying, the flying of all dreams, 34 The 
ancient reaching for the chance to return changed. 35 In 
deepest power the changing and opening, the seed obeying 36 
its own law. 37 When we at last take the 
moment and meanings 38 There will be set in motion 
our most dear wish--- 39 For the wish for escape 
is only a part of the wish, 40 The wish 
for death is not what they say it is. 41 
It is a dancing tribal woman who stands among a 
room 42 And says, "Won't somebody come and kill me?" 
and 43 somebody does; 44 This is in order that 
she dance the dance of rebirth. Tomorrow. 45 For the 
plane is not over power, and the weapons are all 
46 weapons, 47 But the seeds of all things are 
the ways of choice, of the forms 48 Declaring the 
energy we breathe and man, 49 Breaking. Changing. Forever broken 
and made. 50 Through our own need 51 We come 
again to our own deep, 52 We go and grow. 
53 The peace of growth may follow; now we see 
war in loss, 54 When we imagine peace it is 
process, is seed. 55 It will be given its body 
when we give it. 56 But here the nearest: this 
moment, this hero.
