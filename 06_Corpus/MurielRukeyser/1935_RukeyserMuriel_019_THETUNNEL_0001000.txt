wet intestinal movings of another body, starving 108 not knowing 
the muscles' flexing. 109 Shall we losing our ego gain 
it, saddening 110 after no response and a turning away? 
Sheer 111 the skyscrapers stand, pure without meaning, single 112 
in desire rising to touch the sky : 113 the 
diver waits, arms thrust in white dihedral 114 to air 
and next moment's water : the flash of shock 115 
travels through diver lover tower plane reaching 116 sky, a 
contact in desire, leaving 117 bondage in flight. Sever the 
cords binding our bones, 118 loosen us to each other, 
approach, night, return me love : 119 unblind me, give 
me back myself, touch me now : 120 slide, night, 
into the climates of the mind.121 The cattle-trains edge along 
the river, bringing morning on a 122 white vibration 123 
breaking the darkness split with beast-cries : a milk-wagon 124 
proceeds 125 down the street leaving the cold bottles : 
the Mack truck 126 pushes 127 around the corner, tires 
hissing on the washed asphalt. A 128 clear sky 129 
growing candid and later bright. 130 Ceiling unlimited. Visibility unlimited. 
131 They stir on the pillows, her leg moving, her 
face swung 132 windowward 133 vacant with sleep still, modeled 
with light's coming; his 134 dark head 135 among the 
softness of her arm and breast, nuzzled in dreams, 136 
mumbling the old words, hardly roused. They return to 137 
silence. 138 At the airport, the floodlights are snapped off. 
139 Turning, he says, "Tell me how's the sky this 
morning?" 140 "Fair," she answers, 141 "no clouds from where 
I lie; bluer and bluer." "And later 142 and later--- 
143 god, for some sleep into some noon, instead of 
all these 144 mornings 145 with my mouth going stiff 
behind the cowling and wind 146 brushing 147 away from 
me and my teeth freezing against the wind." 148 Light 
gales from the northwest : tomorrow, rain. 149 The street 
is long, with a sprinkling of ashcans; panhandlers 150 begin 
to forage among banana-peels and cardboard boxes. 151 She moves 
to the window, tall and dark before a brightening sky, 
152 full with her six-months' pregnancy molded in ripeness. 153 
Stands, watching the sky's blankness. 154 Very soon : "How 
I love to see you when I wake," he says, 
155 "How the child's meaning in you is my life's 
growing." 156 She faces him, hands brought to her belly's 
level, offering, 157 wordless, looking upon him.. She carries his 
desire well. 158 Sun rises : 6:38 a.m. Sun sets 
. . . . 159 "Flying is what makes you 
strange to me, dark as Asia, 160 almost removed from 
my world even in your closenesses : 161 that you 
should be familiar with those intricacies 162 and a hero 
in mysteries which all the world has wanted." 163 Wind 
velocity changing from 19 to 30. 164 "No, that's wrong," 
and he laughs, "no personal hero's left 165 to make 
a legend. Those centuries have gone. If I fly, 166 
why, I know that countries are not map-colored, that seas 
167 belong to no one, that war's a pock-marking on 
Europe : " 168 The Weather Bureau's forecast, effective until 
noon. 169 "Your friends sleep with strange women desperately, 170 
drink liquor and sleep heavily to forget those skies. 171 
You fly all day and come home truly returning 172 
to me who know only land. And we will have 
this child." 173 New York to Boston : Scattered to 
broken clouds. 174 "The child will have a hard time 
to be an American," 175 he says slowly, "fathered by 
a man whose country is air, 176 who believes there 
are no heroes to withstand 177 wind, or a loose 
bolt, or a tank empty of gas." 178 To Washington 
: Broken clouds becoming overcast. 179 "It will be a 
brave child," she answers, smiling. 180 "We will show planes 
to it, and the bums in the street. 181 You 
will teach it to fly, and I will love it 
182 very much." He thinks of his job, dressing. 183 
Strong west northwest winds above 1000 feet. 184 He thinks 
how many men have wanted flight. 185 He ties his 
tie, looking into his face. 186 Finishes breakfast, hurrying to 
be gone, 187 crossing the river to the airport and 
his place. 188 To Cleveland : Broken clouds to overcast. 
189 She does not imagine how the propeller turns 190 
in a blinding speed, swinging the plane through space; 191 
she never sees the cowling rattle and slip 192 forward 
and forward against the grim blades' grinding. 193 Cruising speed 
1700 R.P.M. 194 Slipping, a failing desire ; slipping like 
death 195 insidious against the propeller, until the blades shake, 
196 bitten by steel, jagged against steel, broken, 197 and 
his face angry and raked by death, staring 198 Strong 
west northwest or west winds above 2000 feet. 199 She 
watches the clock as his return time hurries, 200 the 
schedule ticking off, eating the short minutes. 201 She watches 
evening advance; she knows the child's stirring. 202 She knows 
night. She knows he will not come. 203 Ceiling unlimited. 
Visibility unlimited. 204 The rough skin dusty with coal on 
the slack hands ; 205 lover trailing regret through the 
evening streets 206 uncomforted, walking toward destruction : 207 the 
mouth of the young pilot stiffening 208 (I love to 
see you when I wake at morning) 209 hurtling, spiralling 
that plucks the breath from the throat 210 in a 
long chute to gauged mechanic death. 211 Greyly our vigor 
seeps away, the fingers 212 weak and the lips unspeaking, 
somberly 213 devoid of wholeness are we drowned again 214 
mumbling death as our cheeks stiffen 215 as we go 
down these maelstroms : dissolution. 216 Harsh blue screams summer 
from behind the plane 217 the sea stiffens under it 
sculpturally. 218 Split space, monotonous and even-winged, 219 continue toward 
despair methodically. 220 Destruction and a burning fill these lives 
221 unloved incompetent they compromise 222 with death and the 
bases of emotion fearing 223 the natural calm inclusiveness of 
time. 224 Tigers follow in a splendor of motion 225 
sleek death treads unperturbed among these things, 226 time rages 
like a tiger and the 227 savage defeat swallows the 
fallen wings 228 plunging 229 O Icarus accurate white into 
the sea 230 the wax support too trusted ; the 
white pride 231 in sovereignty collapsed ; go down to 
harbor, 232 go down, plane, to the water's eagerness 233 
engulfed, plunging 234 We have prayed torrents of humility, open 
235 in anguish to be hurt, in terror to be 
fooled. 236 We are beyond demand, waiting a minute 237 
unconscious in attendance : here is strength to be used 
238 delicately, most subtly on the controls and levers. 239 
They begged that time be condensed. Extend space for us, 
240 let us include this memory in ourselves, 241 time 
and our dividend of history.
