for the eightieth birthday of Frances G. Wickes 1 Whenever 
you wake, you will find journeying--- 2 Even in deep 
night, dreams surrounding your dreams--- 3 The song of waking 
begun, prepared in silence, 4 Planted in silence as her 
life is planted 5 Among the constellations and the days. 
6 Whenever you wake, you will hear entering 7 The 
song of meanings, a melody of green; 8 The image 
of a legendary woman 9 Dancing among her mercies, in 
essence emerging 10 Female to leap into the dragon-throning sea. 
11 Voices of nourishing, lifting the newborn up, 12 Away,---they 
lift away, newborn to all, 13 To the nourisher, to 
self born, to new life. 14 Voices of waking that 
journey in our lives 15 As renaissance and rain of 
images. 16 All of the people of the play are 
here, 17 In a storm of light; birthday; at any 
moment. 18 Full in their powers, and the voice of 
waking 19 Sings for beginnings; she sings, wherever waking is. 
20 Wherever the deep moon stands, the song arrives. 21 
Nevertheless the moon goes voyages. 22 Nevertheless, the journeying is 
time: 23 Makes birthdays, makes this birthday a resonance 24 
And the remote boundaries of imagining 25 Acknowledge the voices, 
her daily human voice, 26 Blessing this birthday moment her 
monument. 27 Deep in the waking, her life builds in 
light 28 The vision of the body of the soul.
