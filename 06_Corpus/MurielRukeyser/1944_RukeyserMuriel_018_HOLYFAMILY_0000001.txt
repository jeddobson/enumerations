1 A long road and a village. 2 A bloody 
road and a village. 3 A road away from war. 
4 Born, born, we know how it goes. 5 A 
man and woman riding. 6 Riding, the new-born child. 7 
White sky, clever and wild. 8 Born, born, we know 
how it goes. 9 The wheel goes back. 10 How 
is it with the child? 11 How is it with 
the world? 12 Born, born, we know how it goes. 
13 Never look at the child. 14 Give it to 
bloody ground. 15 By this dream we are bound. 16 
Born, born, we know how it goes. 17 Riding between 
these hills, 18 Woman and man alone 19 Enter the 
battle-line. 20 Born, born, we know how it goes. 21 
They childless disappear 22 Among the fighting men. 23 Two 
thousand years until they come again. 24 Born, born, we 
know how it goes.
