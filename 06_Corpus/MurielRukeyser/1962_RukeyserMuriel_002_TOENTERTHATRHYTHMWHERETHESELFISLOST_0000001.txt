1 To enter that rhythm where the self is lost, 
2 here breathing : heartbeat : and the subtle music 
3 of their relation make our dance, and hasten 4 
us to the moment when all things become 5 magic, 
another possibility. 6 That blind moment, midnight, when all sight 
7 begins, and the dance itself is all our breath, 
8 and we ourselves the moment of life and death. 
9 Blinded; but given now another saving, 10 the self 
as vision, at all times perceiving, 11 all arts all 
senses being languages, 12 delivered of will, being transformed in 
truth --- 13 for life's sake surrendering moment and images, 
14 writing the poem; in love making; bringing to birth.
