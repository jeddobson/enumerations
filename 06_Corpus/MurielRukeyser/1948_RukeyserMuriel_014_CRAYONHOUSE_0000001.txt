1 Two or three lines across; the black ones, down, 
2 into the ground where grass sparkles and shines; 3 
but the foundation is the green and the shine. 4 
Windows are drawn in. Overhead the sun 5 surrounded by 
his crown, continually given. 6 It is a real place, 
door, floor, and windows. 7 I float past it. I 
look in at the little children. 8 I climb up 
the straight and planted path, alone. 9 In the city 
today grown, walking on stone. 10 a suddenness of doors, 
windows, bread and rolls. 11 Roads are in all I 
know : weapon and refugee, 12 color of thunder calling 
Leave this room, 13 Get out of this house. Even 
then, joy began, 14 went seeking through the green world, 
wild and no longer wild, 15 always beginning again. Steady 
giving and green decision, 16 and the beginning was real. 
The drawing of a child.
