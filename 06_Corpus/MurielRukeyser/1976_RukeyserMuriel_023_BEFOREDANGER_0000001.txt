1 There were poems all over Broadway that morning. 2 
Blowing across traffic. Against the legs. 3 Held for a 
moment on the backs of hands. 4 Drifts of poems 
in doorways. 5 The crowd was a river to the 
highest tower 6 all the way down that avenue. 7 
Snow on that river, torn paper 8 of their faces. 
9 Late at night, in a dark-blue sleep, 10 the 
paper stopped blowing. 11 Lightning struck at me from behind 
my eyes.
