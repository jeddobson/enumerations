1 Light falling on that filled will drives 2 The 
mares of energy, breakneck and black, 3 Into our days, 
into our days. 4 A man's life and the buried 
life, 5 Leading and losing. A leap upon the dark. 
6 They cannot find him now who gave him gifts: 
7 His throat is vulnerable. His endless body 8 Now 
is his strength, it is his penetration: 9 His appetites, 
his hope, are his wide images, 10 They are the 
world that enters and they are his own self. 11 
Women like images, friends like ideas of man, 12 Arrive 
in meanings that are hated and found. 13 Find him. 
He is somehow yourself. His eyes your eyes. 14 The 
myth of your journey, your living traveler, 15 In the 
middle of life breathing the sequences 16 Of revelation; your 
story and your song.
