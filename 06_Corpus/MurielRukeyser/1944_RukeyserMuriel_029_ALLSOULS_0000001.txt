1 The day of life and death offers its flowers: 
2 Branches of flame toward a midnight lake of stars, 
3 And the harsh sunny smell of weeds at noon. 
4 In the clear season, we sit upon the graves 
5 (Northern red leaf, frost-witches and toy ghost): 6 Here 
are the crystal skull and flowering bone. 7 The cloak 
of blood down the shoulder of the bull. 8 Whirl 
of mirrors and light about the blade 9 And the 
bullring turning groaning to the sun.--- 10 We are all 
sitting on graves, drinking together, 11 Each grave a family 
gay on the hot grass, 12 Its bottle, its loaf 
of bread in a basket, 13 And a few peaches 
too perfect ever to wither. 14 And the river of 
light down the shoulder of the hill. 15 The drink 
of flowers and fire in the sun, 16 The child 
in pink holding her sugar skull--- 17 This appetite raving 
on death's high holiday: 18 Love of the dead, fierce 
love of the alive. 19 We eat the feast of 
our mortality, 20 Drink fiery joy, and death sinks down 
with day. 21 O in the burning day of life 
and death 22 The strong drink running down the shoulder 
of the grave!
