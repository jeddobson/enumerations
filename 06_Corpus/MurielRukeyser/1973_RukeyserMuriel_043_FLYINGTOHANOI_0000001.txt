1 I thought I was going to the poets, but 
I am going to the 2 children. 3 I thought 
I was going to the children, but I am going 
to the 4 women. 5 I thought I was going 
to the women, but I am going to the 6 
fighters. 7 I thought I was going to the fighters, 
but I am going to the 8 men and women 
who are inventing peace. 9 I thought I was going 
to the inventors of peace, but I am going 10 
to the poets. 11 My life is flying to your 
life.
