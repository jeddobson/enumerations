1 In all the cities of this year 2 I 
have longed for the other city. 3 In all the 
rooms of this year 4 I have entered one red 
room. 5 In all the futures I have walked toward 
6 I have seen a future I can hardly name. 
7 But here the road we drive 8 Turns upon 
another country. 9 I have seen white beginnings, 10 A 
slow sea without glaze or speed, 11 Movement of land, 
a long lying-down dance. 12 This is fog-country. Milk. Country 
of time. 13 I see your tormented color, the steep 
front of your storm 14 Break dissipated among limitless profiles. 
15 I see the shapes of waves in the cross-sea 
16 Advance, a fog-surface over the fog-floor. 17 Seamounts, slow-flowing. 
Color. Plunge-point of air. 18 In all the meanings of 
this year 19 There will be the ferny meaning. 20 
It rises leaning and green, streams through star-lattices; 21 After 
the last cliff, wave-eroded silver, 22 Forgets the limitations of 
our love, 23 These drifts and caves dissolve and pillars 
of these countries 24 Long-crested dissolve to the future, a 
new form.
