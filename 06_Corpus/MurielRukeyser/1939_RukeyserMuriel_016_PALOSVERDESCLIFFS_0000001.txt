2 Cannot without the sun, the flaming instroke 3 direct 
and personal, the haystack on the peak. 4 And if 
the flashing hay could produce the illusion. 5 Cannot without 
the sea beneath and blue 6 on accurate margin the 
surfboard boy returned 7 tiny from the Pacific to a 
fabulous shore. 8 And if the seascape could produce the 
illusion. 9 Cannot without whole scene : city and oilfield 
10 in metal forests to the hills' mirage, 11 Hollywood 
and the high bare brilliant mountains. 12 Illusion of calm 
over a minute plain 13 in steepness opened, an overheated 
landscape 14 familiar in movies and recurrent dreams. 15 O 
prism of summer and produced illusion: 16 absolute calm. Past 
newsreel, print, and view, 17 vicarious true images, do you 
see, over the 18 high-flying plane below you, over the 
harbor, 19 over the city, over this precipice, 20 do 
you see hot grass, mile-off counties, fire-surfaced sea, 21 obsessions 
of sight cliff-hung, as movie, as peace?
