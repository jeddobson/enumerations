1 On the roads at night I saw the glitter 
of eyes: 2 my dark around me let shine one 
ray; that black 3 allowed their eyes : spangles in 
the cat's, air in the moth's 4 eye shine, 5 
mosaic of the fly, ruby-eyed beetle, the eyes that never 
weep, 6 the horned toad sitting and its tear of 
blood, 7 fighters and prisoners in the forest, people 8 
aware in this almost total dark, with the difference, 9 
the one broad fact of light. 10 Eyes on the 
road at night, sides of a road like rhyme; 11 
the floor of the illumined shadow sea 12 and shallows 
with their assembling flash and show 13 of sight, root, 
holdfast, eyes of the brittle stars. 14 And your eyes 
in the shadowy red room, 15 scent of the forest 
entering, various time 16 calling and the light of wood 
along the ceiling 17 and over us birds calling and 
their circuit eyes. 18 And in our bodies the eyes 
of the dead and the living 19 giving us gifts 
at hand, the glitter of all their eyes.
