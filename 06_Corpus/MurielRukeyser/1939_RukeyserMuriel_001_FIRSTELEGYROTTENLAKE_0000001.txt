1 As I went down to Rotten Lake I remembered 
2 the wrecked season, haunted by plans of salvage, 3 
snow, the closed door, footsteps and resurrections, 4 machinery of 
sorrow. 5 The warm grass gave to the feet and 
the stilltide water 6 was floor of evening and magnetic 
light and 7 reflection of wish, the black-haired beast with 
my eyes 8 walking beside me. 9 The green and 
yellow lights, the street of water standing 10 point to 
the image of that house whose destruction 11 I weep 
when I weep you. My door (no), poems, rest, 12 
(don't say it!) untamable need. 13 When you have left 
the river you are a little way 14 nearer the 
lake; but I leave many times. 15 Parents parried my 
past; the present was poverty, 16 the future depended on 
my unfinished spirit. 17 There were no misgivings because there 
was no choice, 18 only regret for waste, and the 
wild knowledge: 19 growth and sorrow and discovery. 20 When 
you have left the river you proceed alone; 21 all 
love is likely to be illicit; and few 22 friends 
to command the soul; they are too feeble. 23 Rejecting 
the subtle and contemplative minds 24 as being too thin 
in the bone; and the gross thighs 25 and unevocative 
hands fail also. But the poet 26 and his wife, 
those who say Survive, remain; 27 and those two who 
were with me on the ship 28 leading me to 
the sum of the years, in Spain. 29 When you 
have left the river you will hear the war. 30 
In the mountains, with tourists, in the insanest groves 31 
the sound of kill, the precious face of peace. 32 
And the sad frightened child, continual minor, 33 returns, nearer 
whole circle, O and nearer 34 all that was loved, 
the lake, the naked river, 35 what must be crossed 
and cut out of your heart, 36 what must be 
stood beside and straightly seen. 37 As I went down 
to Rotten Lake I remembered 38 how the one crime 
is need. The man lifting the loaf 39 with hunger 
as motive can offer no alibi, is 40 always condemned. 
41 These are the lines at the employment bureau 42 
and the tense students at their examinations; 43 needing makes 
clumsy and robs them of their wish, 44 in one 
fast gesture 45 plants on them failure of the imagination; 
46 and lovers who lower their bodies into the chair 
47 gently and sternly as if the flesh had been 
wounded, 48 never can conquer. 49 Their need is too 
great, their vulnerable bodies 50 rigidly joined will snap, turn 
love away, 51 fear parts them, they lose their hands 
and voices, never 52 get used to the world. 53 
Walking at night, they are asked Are you your best 
friend's 54 best friend? and must say No, not yet, 
they are 55 love's vulnerable, and they go down to 
Rotten Lake 56 hoping for wonders. 57 Dare it arrive, 
the day when weakness ends? 58 When the insistence is 
strong, the wish converted? 59 I prophesy the meeting by 
the water 60 of these desires. 61 I know what 
this is, I have known the waking 62 when every 
night ended in one cliff-dream 63 of faces drowned beneath 
the porous rock 64 brushed by the sea; 65 suffered 
the change : deprived erotic dreams 66 to images of 
that small house where peace 67 walked room to room 
and always with one face 68 telling her stories, 69 
and needed that, past loss, past fever, and the 70 
attractive enemy who in my bed 71 touches all night 
the body of my sleep, 72 improves my summer 73 
with madness, impossible loss, and the dead music 74 of 
altered promise, a room torn up by the roots, 75 
the desert that crosses from the door to the wall, 
76 continual bleeding, 77 and all the time that will 
which cancels enmity, 78 seeks its own Easter, arrives at 
the water-barrier; 79 must face it now, biting the lakeside 
ground; 80 looks for its double, 81 the twin that 
must be met again, changeling need, 82 blazing in color 
somewhere, flying yellow 83 into the forest with its lucid 
edict : 84 take to the world, 85 this is 
the honor of your flesh, the offering 86 of strangers, 
the faces of cities, honor of all your wish. 87 
Immortal undoing! I say in my own voice. These prophecies 
88 may all come true, 89 out of the beaten 
season. I look in Rotten Lake 90 wait for the 
flame reflection, seeing only 91 the free beast flickering black 
along my side 92 animal of my need, 93 and 
cry I want! I want! rising among the world 94 
to gain my converted wish, the amazing desire 95 that 
keeps me alive, though the face be still, be still, 
96 the slow dilated heart know nothing but lack, 97 
now I begin again the private rising, 98 the ride 
to survival of that consuming bird 99 beating, up from 
dead lakes, ascents of fire.
