1 Niobe 2 wild 3 with unbelief 4 as all 
5 her ending 6 turns to stone 7 Not gentle 
8 weeping 9 and souvenirs 10 but hammering 11 honking 
12 agonies 13 Forty-nine tragic years 14 are done 15 
and the twentieth century 16 not begun: 17 All tears, 
18 all tears, 19 all tears. 20 Water 21 from 
her rock 22 is sprung 23 and in this water 
24 lives a seed 25 That must endure 26 and 
grow 27 and shine 28 beasts, gardens 29 at last 
rivers 30 A man 31 to be born 32 to 
start again 33 to tear 34 a woman 35 from 
his side 36 And wake 37 to start 38 the 
world again.
