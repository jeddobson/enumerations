for Alfred Marshak 1 You made healing as you wanted 
us to make bread and poems. 2 In your abrasive 
life of gifts, 3 In the little ravine telling the 
life of the future 4 When your science would be 
given to all, 5 A broken smile. 6 In the 
sun, speaking of the joining of nerve-endings, 7 Make the 
wounds part of the well body. 8 Make a healed 
life. 9 You shouted, waving your hand with the last 
phalange 10 Of the little finger missing, you whole man, 
11 "Make it well! Make things accessible!" 12 He is 
a pollinating man. We are his seedlings. 13 Marshak, I 
was your broken nerve-endings, 14 You made your man-made bridges 
over the broken nerves. 15 What did you do? Inspect 
potatoes, wait for passports, do 16 your research, 17 While 
the State Department lady was saying, "Let him swim," 18 
While the chief who had the power to allow your 
uses 19 To move, a proper use of plastic, a 
bridge across broken nerves 20 Stopped you there (and asked 
me to marry him). 21 Saying to you, Marshak, full 
of creation as the time 22 Went deeper into war, 
and you to death: 23 "The war will be over 
before your work is ready."
