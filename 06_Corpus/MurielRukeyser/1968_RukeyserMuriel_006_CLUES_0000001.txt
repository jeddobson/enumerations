1 How will you catch these clues at the moment 
of waking 2 take them, make them yours? Wake, do 
you, 3 and light the lamp of sharpest whitest beam 
4 and write them down in the room of night 
on white--- 5 night opening and opening white 6 paper 
under white light, write what streamed 7 from you in 
darkness 8 into you by dark? 9 Indian Baptiste saying, 
We painted our dreams. 10 We painted our dreams on 
our faces and bodies. 11 We took them into us 
by painting them on ourselves. 12 When we saw the 
water mystery of the lake 13 after the bad dream, 
we painted the lines and masks, 14 when the bear 
wounded me, I painted for healing. 15 When we were 
told in our dreams, in the colors of day 16 
red for earth, black for the opposite, rare green, white. 
17 Yellow. When I dreamed of weeping and dreamed of 
sorrow 18 I painted my face with tears, with joy. 
19 Our ghost paintings and our dreams of war. 20 
The whole brow, the streak, the hands and sex, the 
breast. 21 The spot of white, one hand black, one 
hand red. 22 The morning star appearing over the hill. 
23 We took our dreams into our selves. 24 We 
took our dreams into our bodies.
