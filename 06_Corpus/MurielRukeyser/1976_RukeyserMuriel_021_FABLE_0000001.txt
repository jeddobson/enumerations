for Herbert Kohl 1 Yes it was the prince's kiss. 
2 But the way was prepared for the prince. 3 
It had to be. 4 When the attendants carrying the 
woman 5 ---dead they thought her lying on the litter--- 
6 stumbled over the root of a tree 7 the 
bit of deathly apple in her throat 8 jolted free. 
9 Not strangled, not poisoned! 10 She 11 can come 
alive. 12 It was an "accident" they hardly noticed. 13 
The threshold here comes when they stumble. 14 The jolt. 
And better if we notice, 15 However, their noticing is 
not 16 Essential to the story. 17 A miracle has 
even deeper roots, 18 Something like error, some profound defeat. 
19 Stumbled-over, the startle, the arousal, 20 Something never perceived 
till now, the taproot.
