1 When you imagine trumpet-faced musicians 2 blowing again inimitable 
jazz 3 no art can accuse nor cannonadings hurt, 4 
or coming out of your dreams of dirigibles 5 again 
see the unreasonable cripple 6 throwing his crutch headlong as 
the headlights 7 streak down the torn street, as the 
three hammerers 8 go One, Two, Three on the stake, 
triphammer poundings 9 and not a sign of new worlds 
to still the heart; 10 then stare into the lake 
of sunset as it runs 11 boiling, over the west 
past all control 12 rolling and swamps the heartbeat and 
repeats 13 sea beyond sea after unbearable suns; 14 think: 
poems fixed this landscape: Blake, Donne, Keats.
