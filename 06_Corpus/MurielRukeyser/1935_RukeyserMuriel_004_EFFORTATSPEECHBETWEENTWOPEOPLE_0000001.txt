1 : Speak to me. Take my hand. What are 
you now? 2 I will tell you all. I will 
conceal nothing. 3 When I was three, a little child 
read a story about a rabbit 4 who died, in 
the story, and I crawled under a chair : 5 
a pink rabbit : it was my birthday, and a 
candle 6 burnt a sore spot on my finger, and 
I was told to be happy. 7 : Oh, grow 
to know me. I am not happy. I will be 
open : 8 Now I am thinking of white sails 
against a sky like music, 9 like glad horns blowing, 
and birds tilting, and an arm about me. 10 There 
was one I loved, who wanted to live, sailing. 11 
: Speak to me. Take my hand. What are you 
now? 12 When I was nine, I was fruitily sentimental, 
13 fluid : and my widowed aunt played Chopin, 14 
and I bent my head on the painted woodwork, and 
wept. 15 I want now to be close to you. 
I would 16 link the minutes of my days close, 
somehow, to your days. 17 : I am not happy. 
I will be open. 18 I have liked lamps in 
evening corners, and quiet poems. 19 There has been fear 
in my life. Sometimes I speculate 20 On what a 
tragedy his life was, really. 21 : Take my hand. 
Fist my mind in your hand. What are 22 you 
now? 23 When I was fourteen, I had dreams of 
suicide, 24 and I stood at a steep window, at 
sunset, hoping toward 25 death : 26 if the light 
had not melted clouds and plains to beauty, 27 if 
light had not transformed that day, I would have leapt. 
28 I am unhappy. I am lonely. Speak to me. 
29 : I will be open. I think he never 
loved me : 30 he loved the bright beaches, the 
little lips of foam 31 that ride small waves, he 
loved the veer of gulls: 32 he said with a 
gay mouth: I love you. Grow to know me. 33 
: What are you now? If we could touch one 
another, 34 if these our separate entities could come to 
grips, 35 clenched like a Chinese puzzle . . . 
yesterday 36 I stood in a crowded street that was 
live with people, 37 and no one spoke a word, 
and the morning shone. 38 Everyone silent, moving . . 
. . Take my hand. Speak to me.
