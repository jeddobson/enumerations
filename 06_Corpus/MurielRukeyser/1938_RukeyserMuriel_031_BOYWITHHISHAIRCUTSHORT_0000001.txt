1 Sunday shuts down on this twentieth-century evening. 2 The 
El passes. Twilight and bulb define 3 the brown room, 
the overstuffed plum sofa, 4 the boy, and the girl's 
thin hands above his head. 5 A neighbor radio sings 
stocks, news, serenade. 6 He sits at the table, head 
down, the young clear neck exposed, 7 watching the drugstore 
sign from the tail of his eye; 8 tattoo, neon, 
until the eye blears, while his 9 solicitous tall sister, 
simple in blue, bending 10 behind him, cuts his hair 
with her cheap shears. 11 The arrow's electric red always 
reaches its mark, 12 successful neon! He coughs, impressed by 
that precision. 13 His child's forehead, forever protected by his 
cap, 14 is bleached against the lamplight as he turns 
head 15 and steadies to let the snippets drop. 16 
Erasing the failure of weeks with level fingers, 17 she 
sleeks the fine hair, combing: "You'll look fine tomorrow! 18 
You'll surely find something, they can't keep turning you down; 
19 the finest gentleman's not so trim as you!" Smiling, 
he raises 20 the adolescent forehead wrinkling ironic now. 21 
He sees his decent suit laid out, new-pressed, 22 his 
carfare on the shelf. He lets his head fall, meeting 
23 her earnest hopeless look, seeing the sharp blades splitting, 
24 the darkened room, the impersonal sign, her motion, 25 
the blue vein, bright on her temple, pitifully beating.
