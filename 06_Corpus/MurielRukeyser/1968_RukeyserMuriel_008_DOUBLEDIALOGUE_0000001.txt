Homage to Robert Frost 1 In agony saying : "The 
last night of his life, 2 My son and I 
in the kitchen : At half-past one 3 He said, 
'I have failed as a husband. Now my wife 4 
Is ill again and suffering.' At two 5 He said, 
'I have failed as a farmer, for the sun 6 
Is never there, the rain is never there.' 7 At 
three he said, 'I have failed as a poet who 
8 Has never not once found my listener. 9 There 
is no sense to my life.' But then he heard 
me out. 10 I argued point by point. Seemed to 
win. Won. 11 He spoke to me once more when 
I was done: 12 'Even in argument, father, I have 
lost.' 13 He went and shot himself. Now tell me 
this one thing: 14 Should I have let him win 
then? Was I wrong?" 15 To answer for the land 
for love for song 16 Arguing life for life even 
at your life's cost.
