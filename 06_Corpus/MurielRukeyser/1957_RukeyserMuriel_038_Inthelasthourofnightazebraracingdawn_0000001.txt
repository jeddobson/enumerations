1 In the last hour of night, a zebra racing 
dawn, 2 Black-and-white hour that feeds the night and the 
light, 3 Feeding the strong infants; when the well is 
open; 4 When all the birds of day begin to 
sing. 5 He turning in sleep finds through a journey 
of dream 6 One woman in whom all the rivers 
of his storm 7 Cluster and fill, as words, as 
woman. Finds 8 The running of stones in a riverbed 
9 Troubling hillsides with their leaves 10 Over black branches. 
Swinging-to of mountains 11 No heavier than sails riding to 
rendezvous. 12 Dense in our blood, abstract as the idea 
of God. 13 As smoky misereres, as the birthcry. 14 
The big few clusters, the body of a man. 15 
The clusters of her body. Sleep of gardens, 16 Sleep 
of rain, always distant and present 17 As your own 
deprived childhood. No. Not deprived. 18 Yes. For it never 
saw it was deprived. 19 But there was the unknown, 
the great dream of the poor 20 And of all 
men; your childhood found that friend. 21 Was it the 
faceless, the man in the purple graveyard? 22 No. Hidden. 
And kind. In endless offering. 23 And now in early 
sleep, a ripple uncovering 24 The roots of the diverse, 
the city of love. 25 A note in music. His 
sleep going long and along.
