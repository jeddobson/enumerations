1 Power never dominion. 2 Some other power. 3 Some 
force flaking in light, avalanches of lilies, 4 Days and 
the sun renewed in semen, pure 5 Among the uncorrupted 
fires, fire's ancestor, 6 Forgotten; worshipped secretly; 7 Where the 
vestigial Lucifer regales 8 Craters of memory; where leans 9 
Some fleshly girl, the shaped stones of desire 10 Leaping 
in color at her human cunt. 11 They will translate 
this girl. She will appear 12 In textbooks as a 
sacrificed antelope 13 Guilt running shiny over the short fur. 
14 Ideas of shame did split that throat. 15 But 
none of that is true tonight. 16 The girl was 
leaning over the crater, I dreamt it, 17 The shriveled 
flowers twisted in her hair, 18 And jewels budded at 
her throat. 19 The girl of choice, remembering the past 
fires, 20 Praising the word, the columns in the grove, 
21 Arbor vitae uterinae 22 Locked by such branches, light 
in the dense forest, 23 Praising the world unknown and 
feeling beat 24 Among her branches 25 A human child. 
26 Brambles of sense! and that responding power 27 Rocking 
the fullness of time. 28 Until it shall be, what 
never was: 29 River and born and dream. 30 Canals 
of music downward serenade 31 New satin gleams under her 
haunches; 32 And, running laterally, 33 And backwards across ripples, 
34 Passing the lower stairs, 35 Even above the unforgettable 
murmur, 36 The sound of oars. 37 Body of the 
splendid, bear me now! 38 Completed by orbits of unhorsèd 
comets, 39 The bronze, paternal stars. 40 Cave of their 
messengers, 41 Thalamic cleft where the divorcèd myth 42 Begged 
to be nursed through hysteria that leap year, 43 Sank 
at the window---O the famous view! 44 This side or 
that side of the balcony 45 Falling, the graceless sanatorium 
swan, 46 Breaking nobody's kneecaps but her own. 47 Passes 
the pear orchard near the middle hill 48 At the 
wind's moment when all sails are lowered, 49 A small 
bird kiares, slope of his flight, the blue 50 Yielding 
flutes of his feathers, that small wing 51 Bounds us 
above---kiar! Inscribing our horizon. 52 A high note over our 
necessity.
