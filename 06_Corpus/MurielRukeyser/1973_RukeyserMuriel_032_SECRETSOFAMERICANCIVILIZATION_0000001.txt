for Staughton Lynd 1 Jefferson spoke of freedom but he 
held slaves. 2 Were ten of them his sons by 
black women? 3 Did he sell them? or was his 
land their graves? 4 Do we asking our questions become 
more human? 5 Are our lives the parable which, living, 
6 We all have, we all know, we all can 
move? 7 Then they said : The earth belongs to 
the living, 8 We refuse allegiance, we resign office, and 
we love. 9 They are writing at their desks, the 
thinking fathers, 10 They do not recognize their live sons' 
faces; 11 Slave and slaveholder they are chained together 12 
And one is ancestor and one is child. 13 Escape 
the birthplace; walk into the world 14 Refusing to be 
either slave or slaveholder.
