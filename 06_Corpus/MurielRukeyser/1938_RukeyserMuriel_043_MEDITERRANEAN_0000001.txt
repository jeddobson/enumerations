1 At the end of July, exile. We watched the 
gangplank go 2 cutting the boat away, indicating : sea. 
3 Barcelona, the sun, the fire-bright harbor, war. 4 Five 
days. 5 Here at the rail, foreign and refugee, 6 
we saw the city, remembered that zero of attack, 7 
alarm in the groves, snares through the olive hills, 8 
rebel defeat: leaders, two regiments, 9 broadcasts of victory, tango, 
surrender. 10 The truckride to the city, barricades, 11 bricks 
pried at corners, rifle-shot in street, 12 car-burning, bombs, blank 
warnings, fists up, guns 13 busy sniping, the town walls, 
towers of smoke. 14 And order making, committees taking charge, 
foreigners 15 commanded out by boat. 16 I saw the 
city, sunwhite flew on glass, 17 trucewhite from window, the 
personal lighting found 18 eyes on the dock, sunset-lit faces 
of singers, 19 eyes, goodbye into exile. Saw where Columbus 
rides 20 black-pillared : discovery, turn back, explore 21 a 
new found Spain, coast-province, city-harbor. 22 Saw our parades ended, 
the last marchers on board 23 listed by nation. 24 
I saw first of the faces going home into war 
25 the brave man Otto Boch, the German exile, knowing 
26 he quieted tourists during machine gun battle, 27 he 
kept his life straight as a single issue--- 28 left 
at that dock we left, his gazing Breughel face, 29 
square forehead and eyes, strong square breast fading, 30 the 
narrow runner's hips diminishing dark. 31 I see this man, 
dock, war, a latent image. 32 The boat Ciudad di 
Ibiza , built for 200, 33 loaded with 500, manned 
by loyal sailors, 34 chartered by Belgians when consulates were 
helpless, 35 through a garden of gunboats, margin of the 
port, 36 entered : Mediterranean.37 Frontier of Europe, the tideless 
sea, a field of power 38 touching desirable coasts, rocking 
in time conquests, 39 fertile, the moving water maintains its 
boundaries 40 layer on layer, Troy---seven civilized worlds : 41 
Egypt, Greece, Rome, jewel Jerusalem, 42 giant feudal Spain, giant 
England, this last war. 43 The boat pulled into evening, 
underglaze blue 44 flared instant fire, blackened towards Africa. 45 
Over the city alternate lights occurred; 46 and pale. 47 
in the pale sky emerging stars. 48 No city now, 
a besieged line of lights 49 masking the darkness where 
the country lay. 50 But we knew guns 51 bright 
through mimosa 52 singe of powder 53 and reconnoitering plane 
54 flying anonymous 55 scanning the Pyrenees 56 black now 
above the Catalonian Sea. 57 Boat of escape, dark on 
the water, hastening, safe, 58 holding non-combatants, the athlete, the 
child, 59 the printer, the boy from Antwerp, the black 
boxer, 60 lawyer and communist. 61 The Games had not 
been held. 62 A week of Games, theatre and festival; 
63 world anti-fascist week. Pistol starts race. 64 Machine gun 
marks the war. Answered unarmed, 65 charged the Embarcadero, met 
those guns. 66 And charging through the province, joined that 
army. 67 Boys from the hills, the unmatched guns, 68 
the clumsy armored cars. 69 Drilled in the bullring. Radio 
cries : 70 To Saragossa! And this boat. 71 Escape, 
dark on the water, an overloaded ship. 72 Crowded the 
deck. Spoke little. Down to dinner. 73 Quiet on the 
sea: no guns. 74 The printer said, In Paris there 
is time, 75 but where's its place now; where is 
poetry? 76 This is the sea of war; the first 
frontier 77 blank on the maps, blank sea; Minoan boats 
78 maybe achieved this shore; 79 mountains whose slope divides 
80 one race, old insurrections, Narbo, now 81 moves at 
the colored beach 82 destroyer wardog. "Do not burn the 
church, 83 compañeros, it is beautiful. Besides, 84 it brings 
tourists." They smashed only the image 85 madness and persecution. 
86 Exterminating wish; they forced the door, 87 lifted the 
rifle, broke the garden window, 88 removed only the drawings 
: cross and wrath. 89 Whenever we think of these, 
the poem is, 90 that week, the beginning, exile 91 
remembered in continual poetry. 92 Voyage and exile, a midnight 
cold return, 93 dark to our left mountains begin the 
sky. 94 There, pointed the Belgian, I heard a pulse 
of war, 95 sharp guns while I ate grapes in 
the Pyrenees. 96 Alone, walking to Spain, the five o'clock 
of war. 97 In those cliffs run the sashed and 
sandalled men, 98 capture the car, arrest the priest, kill 
captain, 99 fight our war. 100 The poem is the 
fact, memory fails 101 under and seething lifts and will 
not pass. 102 Here is home-country, who fights our war. 
103 Street-meeting speaker to us: 104 ". . . came 
for Games, 105 you stay for victory; foreign? your job 
is: 106 go tell your countries what you saw in 
Spain." 107 The dark unguarded army left all night. 108 
M. de Paîche said, "We can learn from Spain." 109 
The face on the dock that turned to find the 
war.110 Seething, and falling back, a sea of stars, 111 
Black marked with virile silver. Peace all night, 112 over 
that land, planes 113 death-lists a frantic bandage 114 the 
rubber tires burning monuments 115 sandbag, overturned wagon, barricade 116 
girl's hand with gun food failing, water failing 117 the 
epidemic threat 118 the date in a diary a blank 
page opposite 119 no entry--- 120 however, met 121 the 
visible enemy heroes : madness, infatuation 122 the cache in 
the crypt, the breadline shelled, 123 the yachtclub arsenal, the 
foreign cheque. 124 History racing from an assumed name, peace, 
125 a time used to perfect weapons. 126 If we 
had not seen fighting, 127 if we had not looked 
there 128 the plane flew low 129 the plastic ripped 
by shots 130 the peasant's house 131 if we had 
stayed in our world 132 between the table and the 
desk 133 between the town and the suburb 134 slowly
