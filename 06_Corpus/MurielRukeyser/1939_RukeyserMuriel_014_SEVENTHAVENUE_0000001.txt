1 This is the cripples' hour on Seventh Avenue 2 
when they emerge, the two o'clock night-walkers, 3 the cane, 
the crutch, and the black suit. 4 Oblique early mirages 
send the eyes: 5 light dramatized in puddles, the animal 
glare 6 that makes indignity, makes the brute. 7 Not 
enough effort in the sky for morning. 8 No color, 
pantomime of blackness, landscape 9 where the third layer back 
is always phantom. 10 Here come the fat man, the 
attractive dog-chested 11 legless---and the wounded infirm king 12 with 
nobody to use him as a saint. 13 Now they 
parade in the dark, the cripples' hour 14 to the 
drugstore, the bar, the newspaper-stand, 15 past kissing shadows on 
a window-shade to 16 colors of alcohol, reflectors, light. 17 
Wishing for trial to prove their innocence 18 with one 
straight simple look: 19 the look to set this avenue 
in its colors--- 20 two o'clock on a black street 
instead of 21 wounds, mysteries, fables, kings 22 in a 
kingdom of cripples.
