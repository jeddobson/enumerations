1 Father and I drove to the sand-quarry across the 
ruined 2 marshlands, 3 miles of black grass, burned for 
next summer's green. 4 I reached my hand to his 
beneath the lap-robe, 5 we looked at the stripe of 
fire, the blasted scene. 6 "It's all right," he said, 
"they can control the flames, 7 on one side men 
are standing, and on the other the sea;" 8 but 
I was terrified of stubble and waste of black 9 
and his ugly villages he built and was showing me. 
10 The countryside turned right and left about the car, 
11 straight through October we drove to the pit's heart; 
12 sand, and its yellow canyon and standing pools 13 
and the wealth of the split country set us farther 
apart. 14 "Look," he said, "this quarry means rows of 
little houses, 15 stucco and a new bracelet for you 
are buried there;" 16 but I remembered the ruined patches, 
and I saw the land 17 ruined, 18 exploded, burned 
away, and the fiery marshes bare. 19 "We'll own the 
countryside, you'll see how soon I will, 20 you'll have 
acres to play in" : I saw the written name 
21 painted on stone in the face of the steep 
hill: 22 "That's your name, Father! "And yours!" he shouted, 
laughing. 23 "No, Father, no!" He caught my hand as 
I cried, 24 and smiling, entered the pit, ran laughing 
down its side.
