1 Carlos, your art is embryos. 2 These eyes are 
shaping in the dark; 3 There is a fate map 
in this red 4 Line and that bright red line, 
5 The earliest map of all. 6 These eyes are 
shaping in the dark 7 Toward the requirement of light 
8 And all will grow as they have grown; 9 
Even transplanted will perform 10 Selfwise, themselves, this one, that 
one. 11 Deep in the hieratic blood 12 Toward sleep 
toward dream the process goes, 13 Toward waking move the 
sex, the heart, 14 The self as woman man and 
rose. 15 Carlos, your art is embryos.
