1 My father groaned; my mother wept. 2 Among the 
mountains of the west 3 A deer lifted her golden 
throat. 4 They tore the pieces of the kill 5 
While two dark sisters laughed and sang.--- 6 The hidden 
lions blare until 7 The hunters charge and burn them 
all. 8 And in the black apartment halls 9 Of 
every city in the land 10 A father groans; a 
mother weeps; 11 A girl to puberty has come; 12 
They shriek this, this is the crime 13 The gathering 
of the powers in. 14 At this first sign of 
her next life 15 America is stricken dumb. 16 The 
sharpening of your rocky knife! 17 The first blood of 
a woman shed! 18 The sacred word: Stand Up You 
Dead. 19 Mothers go weep; let fathers groan, 20 The 
flag of infinity is shown. 21 Now you will never 
be alone.
