118 Tell how the men watched. 119 Tell how the 
child chewed its shoe to strips. 120 That day broke 
equal grey, the lockers empty, 121 the cages hanging in 
a depth of silence. 122 Shall we say : there 
were two lines at last : 123 death played like 
a current between them, playing, 124 the little flames of 
death ran along those eyes : ? 125 Death faced 
the men with a desperate seduction, 126 lifted a hand 
with the skill of a hypnotist. 127 They were so 
ready in khaki with bayonets. 128 "George!" he heard. That 
had once been his name. 129 Very carefully he had 
stepped from his place, 130 walked over his ground, over 
the last line. 131 It seemed impossible he should not 
die. 132 When a gun faces you, look down the 
bore, 133 that is the well of death : when 
it 134 confronts you 135 it is not satisfied, it 
draws you steadily 136 more loving than love, eagerer than 
hunger, 137 resolving all unbalance. He went to it. 138 
However, the line held. The plump men raised themselves 139 
up from the chairs in a dreary passion of wrath, 
140 hoisted themselves to the doorway. Spoke. 141 There was 
his body, purpled, death casing him 142 in ice and 
velvet and sleep. Indeed, they spoke, 143 this was unwarranted. 
No, they conceded. No. 144 Perhaps the strike might equal 
victory, 145 a company funeral, and the trucks of coal 
146 ladled up from the earth, 147 heaped on this 
grave.148 Answer with me these certainties 149 of glands swelling 
with sentiment 150 the loves embittered the salts and waters 
mixing 151 a chemic threatening destruction. 152 Answer the men 
walking toward death 153 leaping to death meeting death in 
a kiss 154 able to find of equilibrium none 155 
except that last of hard stone kissing stone. 156 Answer 
the lover's questioning in the streets 157 the evenings domed 
with purple, the bones 158 easing, the flesh slipping perfume 
upon the air : 159 all surfaces of flight are 
pared to planes 160 equal, equilibrated, solid in fulfilment. No 
way 161 is wanted to escape, no explosions craved, 162 
only this desire must be met, this motion 163 be 
balanced with passion ; 164 in the wreaths of time 
given to us what love 165 may reach us in 
the streets the books the years 166 what wreaths of 
love may touch our dreams, 167 what skeins of fine 
response may clothe our flesh, 168 robe us in valor 
brave as our dear wish 169 lover haunting the ghosts 
of rivers, letting time 170 slide a fluid runner into 
darkness 171 give over the sad eyes the marble face 
of pain 172 do not mourn : remember : do 
not forget 173 but never let this treason play you 
mate, 174 take to yourself the branches of green trees 
175 watch the clean sky signed by the flight of 
planes 176 know rivers of love be flooded thoroughly 177 
by love and the years and the past and know 
178 the green tree perishes and green trees grow. 179 
Knock at the doors ; go to the windows ; 
run, 180 you will not find her soon who, lost 
in love, 181 relinquished last month to that silver music 
182 repeating in her throat forsaken tunes. 183 Rigid and 
poised for the latest of these lovers 184 she stretches 
acute in waiting on the bed 185 most avaricious for 
the length of arms 186 the subtle thighs and heavy 
confident head. 187 Taut with a steel strut's singing tautness 
she 188 clinches her softness anguished at postponement 189 hardening 
all her thought she swears to be 190 unpacified by 
minutes of atonement. 191 The ticking of an ormolu clock 
taxes 192 her body with time's weight. The opened door 
193 adjusts such things ; responsive, she relaxes 194 ringing 
in answer to a word before 195 all tensity is 
changed to eagerness. 196 Translated and resolved, the anguish through, 
197 sensitive altogether to the present : 198 "Now?" "Yes," 
she says, "yes," she says, "do." 199 Answer motion with 
motion, be birds flying 200 be the enormous movements of 
the snows, 201 be rain, be love, remain equilibrated 202 
unseeking death, 203 if you must have pilgrimages 204 go 
travelling to balance need with answer 205 suiting the explosion 
to the ensuing shock 206 the foil to the airstream 
running over it 207 food to the mouth, tools to 
the body, mind 208 to the bright mind that leaps 
in necessity 209 go answering answering FLY
