1 Who in one lifetime sees all causes lost, 2 
Herself dismayed and helpless, cities down, 3 Love made monotonous 
fear and the sad-faced 4 Inexorable armies and the falling 
plane, 5 Has sickness, sickness. Introspective and whole, 6 She 
knows how several madnesses are born, 7 Seeing the integrated 
never fighting well, 8 The flesh too vulnerable, the eyes 
tear-torn. 9 She finds a pre-surrender on all sides: 10 
Treaty before the war, ritual impatience turn 11 The camps 
of ambush to chambers of imagery. 12 She holds belief 
in the world, she stays and hides 13 Life in 
her own defeat, stands, though her whole world burn, 14 
A childless goddess of fertility. June 1941
