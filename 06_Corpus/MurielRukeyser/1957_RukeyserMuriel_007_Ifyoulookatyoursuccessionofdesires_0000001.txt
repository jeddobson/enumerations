1 If you look at your succession of desires, 2 
A running flame, a parade of leaders 3 Chosen for 
representing true your need, 4 Or your parade of dreams, 
the lifetime theater 5 Telling you everything sacred is remembered, 
6 The lie and the counter-lie are lost in truth; 
7 If you see your life as a procession of 
images 8 You will know you have not forgotten a 
single meaning. 9 We have known all of this all 
along. 10 To find a way to proceed from the 
revelation. 11 They have threatened us with the penalties of 
division--- 12 What became of the war, the sea of 
immense soldiery 13 Sent over in endless liquid fields of 
sunset? 14 Did it melt to a handful of lies? 
15 No. The war did not melt away. 16 Where 
did your childhood go, and the sword of the garden? 
17 You will see them today. 18 Questionnaire. Write on 
two sides of the paper only. 19 Do you believe 
in your body? Answer yes or no. 20 Do you 
acknowledge your soul? You know they are separate : 21 
How long have you known? 22 When you say Peace, 
do you think War? Two seconds. 23 When they say 
Female, do you think Male? Two seconds. 24 When they 
say Good, do you think Evil? Two seconds 25 We 
have given you, always the opposites. Submit. 26 You have 
felt stillness, guilt, and the death-wish, 27 Haven't you? When? 
How often? How recently? 28 You know what is meant 
by these, don't you know, don't you 29 Know how 
they were reached and how they were chosen? 30 The 
smile is vicious, since the verdict is. 31 Time and 
the rose of form have rung your name. 32 Under 
the laws of growth, the immortal law, 33 You may 
choose in your own voice, and every day. 34 You 
need not ever accept their ideas of guilt, 35 You 
need not accept their ideas of innocence. 36 One voice 
will say in the sounds of penalties 37 War and 
No-War, Good and No-Good, Male and No-Male, 38 And what 
are growth and form and the human wish? 39 I 
will tell you a story. 40 These are the people 
who will not stay discovered. 41 Sunrise over horizons of 
new eyes, the twilight arch 42 Allowing spurs of cloud-informed 
evening, prows of 43 Cumulus heading west 44 To the 
cloudmakers, fathers of clouds and rivers. 45 This is a 
man discovering revelation. 46 America revealed that will not stay 
discovered. 47 Continually found. Related to all finding. 48 Look 
at the man, he can be recognized. 49 Look at 
yourself. We are his record.
