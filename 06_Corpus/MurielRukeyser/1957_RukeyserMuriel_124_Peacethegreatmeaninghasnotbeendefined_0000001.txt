When we say peace as a word, war 3 As 
a flare of fire leaps across our eyes. 4 We

peace is not left, it is no canceling; 8 The 
fierce and human peace is our deep power 9 Born 
to us of wish and responsibility. 10 Â¶ I realize 
the consequences of that which was done on the desert, 
at Alamogordo.
