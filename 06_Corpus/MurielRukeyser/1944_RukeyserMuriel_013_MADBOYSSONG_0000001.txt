1 Fly down, Death: Call me: 2 I have become 
a lost name. 3 One I loved, she put me 
away, 4 Fly down, Death; 5 Myself renounced myself that 
day, 6 Fly down, Death. 7 My eyes in whom 
she looked so deep 8 Long ago flowed away, 9 
My hands which slept on her asleep 10 Withered away, 
11 My living voice I meant to keep, 12 Faded 
and gray. 13 Fly down, Death: Call me: 14 I 
have become a lost name. 15 Evening closes in whispers, 
16 Dark words buried in flame--- 17 My love, my 
mother, my sister, 18 I know there is no blame, 
19 But you have your living voice, 20 Speak my 
forgotten name. 21 Fly down, Death: Call me: 22 I 
have become a lost name. 23 Don't come for me 
in a car 24 To drive me through the town; 
25 Don't rise up out of the water, 26 Once 
is enough to drown; 27 Only drop out of the 
sky, 28 For I am fallen down. 29 Fly down 
Death.
