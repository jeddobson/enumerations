for Vega Hustana 1 Revolution shall be a toy of 
peace to you, 2 children during our effort. Storm covers 
all our days 3 the tracts of sunlight overcome with 
thunder 4 black on this ocean and our youth going. 
5 Slowly our world is shaped to a new country 
6 for living minute fingers, the duplicated flesh : 7 
The old will surrender, forced under; they endure 8 though 
dead adults walk stiffly in the street 9 cramming the 
dead poor in their mouths for meat. 10 Seashores of 
centuries 11 all cosmic whisperings 12 ripple upon this beach, 
13 listen until she sings 14 lullaby to all sudden 
15 all grievous things. 16 Rome fashioned you blankets 17 
Asia, a coverlet, 18 we live for your smiling : 
19 sleep, we shall not forget : 20 these worlds 
are straining 21 to make your Soviet. 22 Beaches of 
darkness! the transparent foam-lips hurrying, 23 pouring 24 spent on 
the margin trailing sea-currents 25 mid-ocean streams : at the 
sand, ankle-deep 26 mother with child braced in the hip's 
firm socket 27 fronting the torrents. 28 Nakedly to the 
extreme of the world come bathers 29 advancing, the pale 
skin pathetic against the sea, 30 untried and bare : 
the flesh, the bones' thin tubes 31 facing dim oceans, 
raving hurricane, windspill, 32 leviathan-tyranny. 33 Child, you shall grow 
to follow, 34 survive, and find 35 wet hollow, submarine 
terror 36 not so unkind 37 as to blast strength, 
your eyes 38 unsealed, and an armed mind. 39 Child 
leans the dark head against protective side 40 turning its 
look softly to the horizon 41 moving its hand along 
the rapid wind. 42 The mother knows this ocean and 
will tell 43 clews to the young eyes' candor, fertile 
thoughts 44 will be asserted. 45 Rage, ocean : foam, 
oppressions, 46 We stand, and these children follow, and all 
will yet be well. 47 Chaos is split : the 
first slow definite strides 48 are taken against the open 
waters; be 49 fresh growth, be confident for braveries 50 
we and our children meet these tides 51 prows of 
revolt launched among barbarous seas.
