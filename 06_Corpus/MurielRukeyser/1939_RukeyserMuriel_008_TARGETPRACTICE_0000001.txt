1 Near Mexico, near April, in the morning. 2 Desert 
where the sun casts his circles of power 3 on 
acquiescent sand shifting beneath them. Car 4 speeding among white 
landscapes; suddenly 5 the permanent scene at the dead-center. 6 
Photo, in circles of speed, how at raw barnside 7 
father and son stand, man with his rifle up 8 
levelled at heartpoint of a nailed-up bird 9 spread, wings 
against the wood. The boy's arm thrown 10 up over 
his eyes, flinching from coming shot. 11 Bullseye, you bullet! 
pinning down the scene. 12 And speed you car over 
the waste of noon 13 into the boundaries of distance 
where 14 the first ring lessens into memory. 15 Until, 
a little lower than the sun, 16 centered in that 
last circle, hangs a free 17 fierce bird down-staring on 
the target of land, 18 circle on circle of power 
spread, and speeding 19 eyes passing from zone to zone, 
from war to where 20 their bullets will never bring 
him down.
