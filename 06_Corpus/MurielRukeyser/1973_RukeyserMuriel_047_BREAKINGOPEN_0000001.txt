1 I come into the room The room stands waiting 
2 river books flowers you are far away 3 black 
river a language just forgotten 4 traveling blaze of light 
dreams of endurance 5 racing into this moment outstretched faces 
6 and you are far away 7 The stars cross 
over 8 fire-flood extremes of singing 9 filth and corrupted 
promises my river 10 A white triangle of need 11 
my reflected face 12 laced with a black triangle of 
need13 Naked among the silent of my own time 14 
and Zig Zag Zag that last letter 15 of a 
secret or forgotten alphabet 16 shaped like our own last 
letter but it means 17 Something in our experience you 
do not know 18 When will it open open opening 
19 River-watching all night 20 will the river 21 swing 
open we are Asia and New York 22 Bombs, roaches, 
mutilation River-watching23 Looking out at the river 24 the city-flow 
seen as river 25 the flow seen as a flow 
of possibility 26 and I too to that sea.27 Summer 
repetitive. The machine screaming 28 Beating outside, on the corrupted 
29 Waterfront. 30 On my good days it appears digging 
31 And building, 32 On others, its monstrous word 33 
Says on one note Gone, killed, laid waste.34 The whole 
thing --- waterfront, war, city, 35 sons, daughters, me --- 
36 Must be re-imagined. 37 Sun on the orange-red roof.38 
Walking into the elevator at Westbeth 39 Yelling in the 
empty stainless-steel 40 Room like the room of this tormented 
year. 41 Like the year 42 The metal nor absorbs 
nor reflects 43 My yelling. 44 My pulled face looks 
at me 45 From the steel walls.46 And then we 
go to Washington as if it were 47 Jerusalem; 48 
and then we present our petition, clearly, 49 rightfully; 50 
and then some of us walk away; 51 and then 
do others of us stay; 52 and some of us 
lie gravely down 53 on that cool mosaic floor, 54 
the Senate. 55 Washington! Your bombs rain down! 56 I 
mourn, I lie down, I grieve.57 Written on the plane:The 
conviction that what is meant by the unconscious is the 
same as what is meant by history. The collective unconscious 
is the living history brought to the present in consciousness, 
waking or sleeping. The personal "unconscious" is the personal history. 
This is an identity. We will now explore further ways 
of reaching our lives, the new world. My own life, 
yours; this earth, this moon, this system, the "space" we 
share, which is consciousness.61 Turbulence of air now. A pause 
of nine minutes.Written on the plane. After turbulence : The 
movement of life : to live more fully in the 
present. This movement includes the work of bringing this history 
to "light" and understanding. The "unconscious" of the race, and 
its traces in art and in social structure and "inventions"---these 
are our inheritance. In facing history, we look at each 
other, and in facing our entire personal life, we look 
at each other. I want to break open. On the 
plane, a white cloud seen through rainbow. The rainbow is, 
optically, on the glass of the window.65 The jury said 
Guilty, Guilty, Guilty, 66 Guilty, Guilty. Each closed face. 67 
I see myself in the river-window. River 68 Slow going 
to its sea. 69 And old, crushed, perverse, waiting, 70 
In loss, in dread, dead tree.71 Inner greet. Greenberg said 
it, 72 Even the tallest man needs inner greet. 73 
This is the great word 74 brought back, in swinging 
seas. The new world.75 End of summer. 76 Dark-red butterflies 
on the river 77 Dark-orange butterflies in the city. 78 
The young men still going to war 79 Or away 
from war, to the prisons, to other countries. 80 To 
the high cold mountains, to the source of the river, 
I too go, 81 Deeper into this room.82 A dream 
remembered only in other dreams. 83 The voice saying: 84 
All you dreaded as a child 85 Came to pass 
in storms of light; 86 All you dreaded as a 
girl 87 Falls and falls in avalanche --- 88 Dread 
and the dream of love will make 89 All that 
time and men may build, 90 All that women dance 
and make. 91 They become you. Your own face 92 
Dances through the night and day, 93 Leading your body 
into this 94 Body-led dance, its mysteries. 95 Answer me. 
Dance my dance.96 River-watching from the big Westbeth windows: 97 
Powerful miles of Hudson, an east-blowing wind 98 All the 
way to Asia. 99 No. Lost in our breath, 100 
Sobbing, lost, alone. The river darkens. 101 Black fow, bronze 
lights, white lights. 102 Something must answer that light, that 
dark. 103 Love, 104 The door opens, you walk in.105 
The old man said, "The introversion of war 106 Is 
the main task of our time." 107 Now it makes 
its poems, when the sky stops killing. 108 I try 
to turn my acts inward and deeper. 109 Almost a 
poem. If it splash outside, 110 All right. 111 My 
teacher says. "Go deeper." 112 The day when the salmon-colored 
flowers 113 Open. 114 I will essay. Go deeper. 115 
Make my poem.116 Going to prison. The clang of the 
steel door. 117 It is my choice. But the steel 
door does clang. 118 The introversion af this act 119 
Past its seeming, past all thought of effect, 120 Until 
it is something like 121 Writing a poem in my 
silent room.122 In prison, the thick air, 123 still, loaded, 
heat on heat. 124 Around your throat 125 for the 
doors are locks, 126 the windows are locked doors, 127 
the hot smell locked around us, 128 the machine shouting 
at us, 129 trying to sell us meat and carpets. 
130 In prison, the prisoners, 131 all of us, all 
the objects, 132 chairs, cots, mops, tables. 133 Only the
