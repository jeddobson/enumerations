1 Hunger 2 of mountains 3 spoke 4 from a 
tiger's throat. 5 Tiger-tooth peaks. 6 The moon. 7 A 
thousand mists 8 turning. 9 Desires of mountains 10 like 
the desires of women, 11 moon-drawn, 12 distant, 13 clear 
black among 14 confusions of silver. 15 Women of Chiapas! 
16 Dream-borne 17 voices of women. 18 Splinters of mountains, 
19 broken obsidian, 20 silver. 21 White tigers 22 haunting 
23 your forehead here 24 sloped in shadow--- 25 black 
hungers of women, 26 confusion 27 turning like tigers 28 
And your voice--- 29 I am 30 almost asleep 31 
almost awake 32 in your arms.
