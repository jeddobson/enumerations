1 Whatever roams the air is traveling 2 Over these 
griefs, these wars and this good. 3 Whatever cries and 
changes, lives and reaches 4 Across the threshold of sense; 
I know the piercing name; 5 Among my silence, in 
cold, the birth-cry came. 6 Salt of these tears whitens 
my eyelashes. 7 Whatever plows the body turns to food: 
8 Before my face, flowers, color which is form. 9 
Cries plow the sea and air and turn to birth 
10 Upon the people-sown, people-flowering earth. 11 A year turns 
in its crisis. In its sleep. 12 Whatever plows our 
dreams is ours to keep. 13 Whatever plows our dreams 
is ours to give: 14 The threshold rises and changes. 
15 I give, I perceive; 16 Here are the gifts 
of day risen at last; 17 Blood of desire, the 
riding of belief 18 Beyond our fury and our silences.
