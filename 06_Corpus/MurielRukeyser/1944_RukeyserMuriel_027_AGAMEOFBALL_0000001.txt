1 On a ground beaten gold by running and 2 
Over the Aztec crest of the sky and 3 Past 
the white religious faces of the 4 Bulls and far 
beyond, the ball goes flying. 5 Sun and moon and 
all the stars of the moon 6 Are dancing across 
our eyes like the flight of armies 7 And the 
loser dies. Dark player and bright 8 Play for the 
twinned stiff god of life and death. 9 They die 
and become the law by which they fight. 10 Walls 
grow out of this light, branches out of the stone, 
11 And fire running from the farthest winds 12 Pours 
broken flame on these fantastic sands 13 Where, sunlit, stands 
the goddess of earth and death, 14 A frightful peasant 
with work-hardened hands. 15 But over the field flash all 
the colors of summer, 16 The battle flickers in play, 
a game like sacrifice. 17 The sun rides over, the 
moon and all her stars. 18 Whatever is ready to 
eat us, we have found 19 This place where the 
gods play out the game of the sky 20 And 
bandy life and death across a summer ground.
