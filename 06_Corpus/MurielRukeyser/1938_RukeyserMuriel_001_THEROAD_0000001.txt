1 These are roads to take when you think of 
your country 2 and interested bring down the maps again, 
3 phoning the statistician, asking the dear friend, 4 reading 
the papers with morning inquiry. 5 Or when you sit 
at the wheel and your small light 6 chooses gas 
gauge and clock; and the headlights 7 indicate future of 
road, your wish pursuing 8 past the junction, the fork, 
the suburban station, 9 well-travelled six-lane highway planned for safety. 
10 Past your tall central city's influence, 11 outside its 
body: traffic, penumbral crowds, 12 are centers removed and strong, 
fighting for good reason. 13 These roads will take you 
into your own country. 14 Select the mountains, follow rivers 
back, 15 travel the passes. Touch West Virginia where 16 
the Midland Trail leaves the Virginia furnace, 17 iron Clifton 
Forge, Covington iron, goes down 18 into the wealthy valley, 
resorts, the chalk hotel. 19 Pillars and fairway; spa; White 
Sulphur Springs. 20 Airport. Gay blank rich faces wishing to 
add 21 history to ballrooms, tradition to the first tee. 
22 The simple mountains, sheer, dark-graded with pine 23 in 
the sudden weather, wet outbreak of spring, 24 crosscut by 
snow, wind at the hill's shoulder. 25 The land is 
fierce here, steep, braced against snow, 26 rivers and spring. 
KING COAL HOTEL, Lookout, 27 and swinging the vicious bend, 
New River Gorge. 28 Now the photographer unpacks camera and 
case, 29 surveying the deep country, follows discovery 30 viewing 
on groundglass an inverted image. 31 John Marshall named the 
rock (steep pines, a drop 32 he reckoned in 1812, 
called) Marshall's Pillar, 33 but later, Hawk's Nest. Here is 
your road, tying 34 you to its meanings: gorge, boulder, 
precipice. 35 Telescoped down, the hard and stone-green river 36 
cutting fast and direct into the town.
