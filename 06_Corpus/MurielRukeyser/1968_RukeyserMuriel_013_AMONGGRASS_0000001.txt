1 Lying here among grass, am I dead am I 
sleeping 2 amazed among silences you touch me never 3 
Here deep under, the small white moon 4 cries like 
a dime and do I hear? 5 The sun gone 
copper or I dissolve 6 no touch no touch a 
tactless land 7 denies my death my fallen hand 8 
silence runs down the riverbeds 9 One tall wind walks 
over my skin 10 breeze, memory 11 bears to my 
body (as the world fades) 12 going in 13 very 
late in the world's night to see roses opening 14 
Remember, love, lying among roses. 15 Did we not lie 
among roses?
