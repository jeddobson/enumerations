1 Nothing was less than it seemed, my darling: 2 
The danger was greater, the love was greater, the suffering 
3 Grows daily great--- 4 And the fear we saw 
gathering into that Spanish valley 5 Is rank in all 
countries, a garden of growing death; 6 Your death, my 
darling, the threat to our lifetime 7 And to all 
we love. 8 Whether you fell at Huesca during the 
lack of guns, 9 Or later, at Barcelona, as the 
city fell, 10 You reach my days; 11 Among the 
heckling of clocks, the incessant failures, 12 I know how 
you recognized our war, and ran 13 To it as 
a runner to his eager wedding 14 Or our immediate 
love. 15 If I indeed killed you, my darling, if 
my cable killed 16 Arriving the afternoon the city fell, 
17 No further guilt 18 Could more irrevocably drive my 
days 19 Through the disordered battles and the cities down 
20 In a clash of metal on murder, a stampede 
of 21 Hunger and death. 22 Other loves, other children, 
other gifts, as you said, 23 "Of the revolution," arrive---but, 
darling, where 24 You entered, life 25 Entered my hours, 
whether you lie fallen 26 Among those sunlight fields, or 
by miracle somewhere stand, 27 Your words of war and 
love, death and another promise 28 Survive as a lifetime 
sound.
