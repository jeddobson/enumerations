1 Girl grown woman fire mother of fire 2 I 
go to the stone street turning to fire. Voices 3 
Go screaming Fire to the green glass wall. 4 And 
there where my youth flies blazing into fire 5 The 
dance of sane and insane images, noon 6 Of seasons 
and days. Noontime of my one hour. 7 Saw down 
the bright noon street the crooked faces 8 Among the 
tall daylight in the city of change. 9 The scene 
has walls stone glass all my gone life 10 One 
wall a web through which the moment walks 11 And 
I am open, and the opened hour 12 The world 
as water-garden lying behind it. 13 In a city of 
stone, necessity of fountains, 14 Forced water fallen on glass, 
men with their axes. 15 An arm of flame reaches 
from water-green glass, 16 Behind the wall I know waterlilies 
17 Drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes 18 
Skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers, 19 Walls standing 
on all things stand in a city noon 20 Who 
will not believe a waterlily fire. 21 Whatever can happen 
in a city of stone, 22 Whatever can come to 
a wall can come to this wall. 23 I walk 
in the river of crisis toward the real, 24 I 
pass guards, finding the center of my fear 25 And 
you, Dick, endlessly my friend during storm. 26 The arm 
of flame striking through the wall of form.27 Born of 
this river and this rock island, I relate 28 The 
changes : I born when the whirling snow 29 Rained 
past the general's grave and the amiable child 30 White 
past the windows of the house of Gyp the Blood. 
31 General, gangster, child. I know in myself the island. 
32 I was the island without bridges, the child down 
whose blazing 33 Eye the men of plumes and bone 
raced their canoes and fire 34 Among the building of 
my young childhood, houses; 35 I was those changes, the 
live darknesses 36 Of wood, the pale grain of a 
grove in the fields 37 Over the river fronting red 
cliffs across --- 38 And always surrounding her the river, 
birdcries, the wild 39 Father building his sand, the mother 
in panic her parks --- 40 Bridges were thrown across, 
the girl arose 41 From sleeping streams of change in 
the change city. 42 The violent forgetting, the naked sides 
of darkness. 43 Fountain of a city in growth, an 
island of light and water. 44 Snow striking up past 
the graves, the yellow cry of spring. 45 Whatever can 
come to a city can come to this city. 46 
Under the tall compulsion 47 of the past 48 I 
see the city 49 change like a man changing 50 
I love this man 51 with my lifelong body of 
love 52 I know you 53 among your changes 54 
wherever I go 55 Hearing the sounds of building 56 
the syllables of wrecking 57 A young girl watching 58 
the man throwing red hot rivets 59 Coals in a 
bucket of change 60 How can you love a city 
that will not stay? 61 I love you 62 like 
a man of life in change. 63 Leaves like yesterday 
shed, the yellow of green spring 64 Like today accepted 
and become one's self 65 I go, I am a 
city with bridges and tunnels, 66 Rock, cloud, ships, voices. 
To the man where the river met 67 The tracks, 
now buried deep along the Drive 68 Where blossoms like 
sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red. 69 Towers falling. 
A dream of towers. 70 Necessity of fountains. And my 
poor, 71 Stirring among our dreams, 72 Poor of my 
own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers 73 And lives, 
looking out through my eyes. 74 The city the growing 
body of our hate and love, 75 The root of 
the soul, and war in its black doorways. 76 A 
male sustained cry interrupting nightmare. 77 Male flower heading upstream. 
78 Among a city of light, the stone that grows. 
79 Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered 80 
Monuments rivetted against flesh. 81 Blue noon where the wall 
made big agonized men 82 Stand like sailors pinned howling 
on their lines, and I 83 See stopped in time 
a crime behind green glass, 84 Lilies of all my 
life on fire. 85 Flash faith in a city building 
its fantasies. 86 I walk past the guards into my 
city of change.87 Many of us Each in his own 
life waiting 88 Waiting to move Beginning to move Walking 
89 And early on the road of the hill of 
the world 90 Come to my landscapes emerging on the 
grass 91 The stages of the theatre of the journey 
92 I see the time of willingness between plays 93 
Waiting and walking and the play of the body 94 
Silver body with its bosses and places 95 One by 
one touched awakened into into 96 Touched and turned one 
by one into flame 97 The theatre of the advancing 
goddess Blossoming 98 Smiles as she stands intensely being in 
stillness 99 Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I 
go 100 And far across a field over the jewel 
grass 101 The play of the family stroke by stroke 
acted out 102 Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey 
stages 103 Of the playings the play of the goddess 
and the god 104 A supple god of searching and 
reaching 105 Who weaves his strength Who dances her more 
alive 106 The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my 
great horses 107 Always the journey long patient many haltings 
108 Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing 109 
When the decision to go on is made 110 Along 
the long slopes of choice and again the world 111 
The play of poetry approaching in its solving 112 Solvings
