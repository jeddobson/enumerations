1 Rabbits breed, flies breed, said the virgin lady; 2 
But I 3 Cannot find my fulness where they rise, 
4 My many children, their burning mouths and eyes, 5 
Their bodies that have other fathers made. 6 The wife 
gone sterile in her weeping said 7 Flies breed, rabbits 
breed; 8 Faith of our time falls hissing on the 
sand, 9 Hard sand, is the hand of man set 
against hope? My bed 10 Whispers to me all year 
my love my hope my land. 11 Rabbits breed, flies 
breed, cried the infinite hearts of all the 12 unborn, 
13 In shady leafy places, underseas and in dim rooms, 
in the prodigal 14 dark, all things are made again, 
but here 15 Among the new dreams and new nightmares, 
who listens, who 16 believes? They give their stone demand 
17 To the born, to the seed and seeking. While 
change emerges like 18 another power from power, no longer 
the old good and evil, 19 but a blessing that 
fares in the world, among the cities torn 20 down 
21 Crying awake, among the clouds who move calling do. 
22 The mouth saying nothing. The air saying live and 
die. 23 The womb saying welcome, the sun saying Dare.
