1 You dynamiting the structure of our loves 2 embrace 
your lovers solving antithesis, 3 open your flesh, people, to 
opposites 4 conclude the bold configuration, finish 5 the counterpoint 
: sky, include earth now. 6 Flying, a long vole 
of descent 7 renders us land again. 8 Flight is 
intolerable contradiction. 9 We bear the bursting seeds of our 
return 10 we will not retreat ; never be moved. 
11 Stretch us onward include in us the past 12 
sow in us history, make us remember triumph. 13 O 
golden fructifying, O the sonorous calls 14 to arms and 
embattled mottoes in one war 15 brain versus brain for 
absolutes, ring harsh! 16 Miners rest from blackness : reapers, 
lay by the sheaves 17 forgive us our tears we 
go to victory 18 in a commune of regenerated lives. 
19 The birds of flight return, crucified shapes 20 old 
deaths restoring vigor through the sky 21 mergent with earth, 
no more horizons now 22 no more unvisioned capes, no 
death; we fly. 23 Answer together the birds' flying 24 
reconcile rest to rest 25 motion to motion's poise, 26 
the guns are dying the past is born again 27 
into these future minds the incarnate past 28 gleaming upon 
the present 29 fliers, grave men, 30 lovers : do 
not stop to remember these, 31 think of them as 
you travel, the tall kind prophets, 32 the flamboyant leapers 
toward death, 33 the little painful children 34 how the 
veins were slit 35 into the Roman basins to fill 
Europe with blood 36 how our world has run over 
bloody with love and blood 37 and the misuses of 
love and blood and veins. 38 Now we arrive to 
meet ourselves at last, 39 we cry beginnings 40 the 
criers in the midnight streets call dawn ; 41 respond 
respond 42 you workers poets men of science and love. 
43 Now we can look at our subtle jointures, study 
our hands, 44 the tools are assembled, the maps unrolled, 
propellers spun, 45 do we say all is in readiness 
: 46 the times approach, here is the signal shock 
: ? 47 Master in the plane shouts "Contact" : 
48 master on the ground : "Contact!" 49 he looks 
up : "Now?" whispering : "Now." 50 "Yes," she says." 
"Do." 51 Say yes, people. 52 Say yes. 53 YES
