1 ---My toes feel like nothing they are so cold. 
Little sticks of 2 wood. They'll break off if I 
knock. What does a stick of wood 3 feel like, 
Miss Lorence? 4 ---Well, a live stick, pretty good I 
guess. Happy. Full of sap. 5 ---What is sap? 6 
---Sap in a tree is like blood in you. 7 
---You know a thing? About the blood in me ... 
8 Inside me it is all wet and blood and 
moving, 9 But outside so dry and careful. 10 All 
the time people are asleep or awake 11 Their inside 
is there doing things. Did you know that? 12 Your 
insides never stops. 13 The blood is always there and 
all inside it is moving 14 And it is blood 
and it is never stopping. 15 So funny, all wet 
inside and all dry outside. 16 Everybody like that. I 
am. 17 Why, Miss Lorence, you are. 18 I wonder 
what you look like inside. Did you ever think about 
it? 19 ---People look pretty much alike inside. I could 
show you a 20 picture, a drawing ... 21 ---A 
picture that would be for you would be for me 
too? 22 ---Yes. 23 ---Then we are alike, you and 
me are alike? 24 ---Yes, but so are most people 
alike. 25 ---But their outsides is different. You and me 
don't look alike. 26 ---No, but inside of you is 
like inside of me, only you are a 27 little 
smaller. 28 ---But I am a boy and you are 
a girl. 29 ---Yes, some things are different in boys 
and girls, but lots of 30 things are just alike, 
31 --- Well . But why don't people look alike 
outside? 32 ---Some people look like their mothers, Paul. I 
do. Or a mother 33 and father mixed, nose like 
one, eyes like the other. Or a father. 34 ---It 
is very hard for me to think that you have 
a father and 35 a mother. Where are they? Are 
they around here? 36 ---No, they are both dead. 37 
---Oh, in the war? 38 ---No, they just died. 39 
---Well, you don't need any now. You're all big enough 
to take 40 care of yourself. I'll take care of 
you, Miss Lorence.---But don't 41 you think it's funny about 
people's blood being inside their skin? 42 And your insides. 
43 ---Yes. 44 ---Are you sure your mother and father 
were not in the war? 45 ---No. They really weren't. 
46 ---Did no blood come out? 47 ---No, They just 
died quietly. 48 ---In the war there is a lot 
lot of blood, and people hurt and 49 hurt and 
die ... It is too bad that there are children 
dead who 50 can never never get old. 51 ---It 
would be too bad not to grow up. 52 ---Yes, 
lots of fun being grownup. You have to do some 
things 53 you don't like, though, and nobody takes care 
of you. 54 ---Would you like somebody to take care 
of you? 55 ---I can do it pretty well. You 
come live with me. You can 56 sleep in my 
bed. My mommy will take care of you. Or maybe 
57 I could come live with you ... 58 But 
it doesn't matter where you live or what you do, 
you still have your insides.
