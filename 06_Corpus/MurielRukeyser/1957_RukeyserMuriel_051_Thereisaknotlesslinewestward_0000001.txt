1 There is a knotless line westward, past terraces 2 
High on the roads, the black form of a car 
3 Traveling under. Here, the clear glittering throat 4 The 
long pull of track that seals the black 5 Of 
quick sleep among the counting, among the hammering 6 Until 
the machine, blades whirling, dances the dance 7 Of Steel, 
and the machine chips and tightens and screams 8 A 
man saying, "A good steel rail will last." 9 A 
man saying, "He will need more than parades."
