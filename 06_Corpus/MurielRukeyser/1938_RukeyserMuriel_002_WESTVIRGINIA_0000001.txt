1 They saw rivers flow west and hoped again. 2 
Virginia speeding to another sea! 3 ---Thomes Batts, Robert Fallam, 
4 Thomas Wood, the Indian Perecute, 5 and an unnamed 
indentured English servant 6 followed the forest past blazed trees, 
pillars of God, 7 were the first whites emergent from 
the east. 8 They left a record to our heritage, 
9 breaking of records. Hoped now for the sea, 10 
for all mountains have their descents about them, 11 waters, 
descending naturally, doe alwaies resort 12 unto the seas invironing 
those lands . . . 13 yea, at home amongst 
the mountaines in England. 14 Coming where this road comes, 
15 flat stones spilled water which the still pools fed. 
16 Kanawha Falls, the rapids of the mind, 17 fast 
waters spilling west. 18 Found Indian fields, standing low cornstalks 
left, 19 learned three Mohetons planted them; found-land 20 farmland, 
the planted home, discovered! 21 War-born: 22 The battle at 
Point Pleasant, Cornstalk's tribes, 23 last stand, Fort Henry, a 
revolution won; 24 the granite SITE OF THE precursor EXECUTION 
25 sabres, apostles OF JOHN BROWN LEADER OF THE 26 
War's brilliant cloudy RAID AT HARPERS FERRY. 27 Floods, heavy

over the gash of gorge and height of pine. 34

deep 36 green rivers cut the rock 37 rapids boiled 
down, 38 a scene of power. 39 Done by the 
dead. 40 Discovery learned it. 41 And the living? 42 
Live country filling west, 43 knotted the glassy rivers; 44 
like valleys, opening mines, 45 coming to life.
