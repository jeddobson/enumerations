1 PAUL: Miss Lorence, we are new to each other, 
2 Because I have not been to you for long, 
for 3 long, for long. 4 You are a dear 
little tree. 5 Sit by me close. 6 I am 
a little horse who is going to sing. 7 Such 
a lot of songs I have to sing, 8 For 
I have not been to you for so long. 9 
Did you ever have a red pain 10 In your 
throat? Mine was, it was mine. 11 Now I am 
here I can sing to you 12 A little song 
all for you. 13 You make me happy. 14 Shall 
I say it in German, in French? 15 No. I 
wiIl not. 16 I will just say it to you 
in talk. 17 It is a little song about me. 
18 I am happy with you, happy like happy 19 
At birthday candles 20 And little gold shoes 21 That 
Jesus wears. 22 Little gold shoes. 23 Yes, a nice 
child. Isn't he a nice child?
