1 Asleep and awake, I wake. 2 Never having written 
3 What I have to say. 4 No poem offers 
of me 5 My central meaning, 6 I have danced 
to my naming 7 And danced away. 8 Now I 
move past my dreams: 9 They yield processions of 10 
Changing images. 11 I want to speak the clear 12 
The intricate meeting-place 13 Of all things with all desires: 
14 Cut down by risk to the root 15 Where 
everything is given. 16 The finding of the child, 17 
The lost voices, songs of all 18 Who take their 
meanings. 19 They are beginning the songs. 20 Mortal, awake, 
I sing and say 21 All is immortal, all 22 
Save personality. 23 Yes, your passion, yes, the time of 
a flower. 24 Move in all your meanings, 25 Go 
lit by many fires, 26 Deep in the secret fires 
27 All speak to all. 28 The deep life lives 
and dies 29 Changes, sings, and sings. 30 Speak before 
I sleep, 31 Before the keepings are given, 32 I 
find my time, and speak, 33 Driven toward love and 
music, 34 Music of forms and desires.
