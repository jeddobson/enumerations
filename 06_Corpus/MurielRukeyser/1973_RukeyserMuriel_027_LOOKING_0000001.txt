1 Battles whose names I do not know 2 Weapons 
whose wish they dare not teach 3 Wars whose need 
they will not show 4 Tear us tear us each 
from each, 5 O my dear 6 Great sun and 
daily touch. 7 Fallen beside a river in Europe, 8 
Burned to grey ash in Africa, 9 Lain down in 
the California jail, 10 O my dear, 11 Great sun 
and daily touch. 12 Flaming in Asia today. 13 I 
saw you stare out over Canada 14 As I stare 
over the Hudson River.
