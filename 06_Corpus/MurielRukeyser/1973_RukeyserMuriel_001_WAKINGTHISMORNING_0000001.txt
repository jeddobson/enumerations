1 Waking this morning, 2 a violent woman in the 
violent day 3 Laughing. 4 Past the line of memory 
5 along the long body of your life 6 in 
which move childhood, youth, your lifetime of touch, 7 eyes, 
lips, chest, belly, sex, legs, to the waves of the 
sheet. 8 I look past the little plant 9 on 
the city windowsill 10 to the tall towers bookshaped, crushed 
together in greed, 11 the river flashing flowing corroded, 12 
the intricate harbor and the sea, the wars, the moon, 
the 13 planets, all who people space 14 in the 
sun visible invisible. 15 African violets in the light 16 
breathing, in a breathing universe. I want strong peace, and 
17 delight, 18 the wild good. 19 I want to 
make my touch poems: 20 to find my morning, to 
find you entire 21 alive moving among the anti-touch people. 
22 I say across the waves of the air to 
you: 23 today once more 24 I will try to 
be non-violent 25 one more day 26 this morning, waking 
the world away 27 in the violent day.
