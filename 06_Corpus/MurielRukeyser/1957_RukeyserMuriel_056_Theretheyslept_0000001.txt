1 There they slept. They left the train. 2 Three 
planes from the plateau airport. 3 Through the low overcast 
into the phoenix sun. 4 Willkie then looking down, burned 
in his rage, 5 Hostile and sweating, saw the eaten 
country 6 Pinnacles into waves receding, the treeform famine 7 
Of water vanished; the waves minimized to a ripple of 
terraces. 8 And all the people invisible. 9 Came down 
10 To bleachers piled with local cotton and beef, 11 
Hills of oranges, glass honey-hives.
