1 Darkness, giving us dream's black unity. 2 Images in 
procession start to flow 3 among the river-currents down the 
years of judgment 4 and past the cities to another 
world. 5 There are flat places. After the waterfall 6 
arched like the torso of love, after the voices 7 
singing behind the waterfall, after the water 8 lying like 
a lover on the heart, 9 there is defeat. 10 
And moving through our spirit in the night 11 memories 
of these places. 12 Not ritual, not nostalgia, but our 
cries, 13 the axe at the heart, continual rebirth, 14 
the crying of our raw desire, 15 young. O many-memoried 
America! 16 In defeat there are no prophets and no 
magicians, 17 only the look in the loved and tortured 
eyes 18 when every fantasy restores, and day denies. 19 
The act of war debased to the act of treason 
20 in an age of treason. We were strong at 
the first. 21 We resisted. We did not plan enough. 
We killed. 22 But the enemy came like thunder in 
the wood, 23 a storm over the treetops like a 
horse's head 24 reared to a great galloping, and war 
25 trampled us down. We lost our young men in 
the 26 fighting, 27 we lost our homeland, our crops 
went under the frost, 28 our children under the hunger. 
Now we stand 29 around this fire, our black hills 
far behind, 30 black water far before us, a glitter 
of time on the sea, 31 glitter of fire on 
our faces, the still faces--- 32 stillness waiting for dreams 
33 and only the shadows moving, 34 shadows and revelations. 
35 In the spring of the year, this new fighting 
broke out. 36 No, when the fields were blond. No, 
the leaves crimson. 37 When the old fighting was over, 
we knew what we were 38 seeing as if for 
a first time our dark hills masked with 39 green, 
40 our blond fields with the trees flame-shaped and black 
41 in burning darkness on the unconsumed. 42 Seeing for 
a first time the body of our love, 43 our 
wish and our love for each other. 44 Then word 
came from a runner, a stranger: 45 "They are dancing 
to bring the dead back, in the 46 mountains." 47 
We danced at an autumn fire, we danced the old 
hate and 48 change, 49 the coming again of our 
leaders. But they did not come. 50 Our singers lifted 
their arms, and a singer cried, 51 "You must sing 
like me and believe, or be turned to rock!" 52 
The winter dawned, but the dead did not come back. 
53 News came on the frost, "The dead are on 
the march!" 54 We danced in prison to a winter 
music, 55 many we loved began to dream of the 
dead. 56 They made no promises, we never dreamed a 
threat. 57 And the dreams spread. 58 But there were 
no armies, and the dead were dead, 59 there was 
only ourselves, the strong and symbol self 60 dreaming among 
defeat, our torture and our flesh. 61 We made the 
most private image and religion, 62 stripped to the last 
resistance of the wish, 63 remembering the fighting and the 
lava beds, 64 the ground that opened, the red wounds 
opening, 65 remembering the triumph in the night, 66 the 
big triumph and the little triumph--- 67 wide singing and 
the battle-flash--- 68 assassination and whisper. 69 In the summer, 
dreaming was common to all of us, 70 the drumbeat 
hope, the bursting heart of wish, 71 music to bind 
us as the visions streamed 72 and midnight brightened to 
belief. 73 In the morning we told our dreams. 74 
They all were the same dream. 75 Dreamers wake in 
the night and sing their songs. 76 In the flame-brilliant 
midnight, promises 77 arrive, singing to each of us with 
tongues of flame: 78 "We are hopes, you should have 
hoped us, 79 We are dreams, you should have dreamed 
us." 80 Calling our name. 81 When we began to 
fight, we sang hatred and death. 82 The new songs 
say, "Soon all people on earth 83 will live together." 
We resist and bless 84 and we begin to travel 
from defeat. 85 Now, as you sing your dream, you 
ask the dancers, 86 in the night, in the still 
night, in the night, 87 "Do you believe what I 
say?" 88 And all the dancers answer "Yes." 89 To 
the farthest west, the sea and the striped country 90 
and deep in the camps among the wounded cities 91 
half-world over, the waking dreams of night 92 outrange the 
horrors. Past fierce and tossing skies 93 the rare desires 
shine in constellation. 94 I hear your cries, you little 
voices of children 95 swaying wild, nightlost, in black fields 
calling. 96 I hear you as the seething dreams arrive 
97 over the sea and past the flaming mountains. 98 
Now the great human dream as great as birth or 
death, 99 only that we are not given to remember 
birth, 100 only that we are not given to hand 
down death, 101 this we hand down and remember. 102 
Brothers in dream, naked-standing friend 103 rising over the night, 
crying aloud, 104 beaten and beaten and rising from defeat, 
105 crying as we cry: We are the world together. 
106 Here is the place in hope, on time's hillside, 
107 where hope, in one's image, wavers for the last 
time 108 and moves out of one's body up the 
slope. 109 That place in love, where one's self, as 
the body of love, 110 moves out of the old 
lifetime towards the beloved. 111 Singing. 112 Who looks at 
the many colors of the world 113 knowing the peace 
of the spaces and the eyes of love, 114 who 
resists beyond suffering, travels beyond dream, 115 knowing the promise 
of the night-flowering worlds 116 sees in a clear day 
love and child and brother 117 living, resisting, and the 
world one world 118 dreaming together.
