1 These roads will take you into your own country. 
2 Seasons and maps coming where this road comes 3 
into a landscape mirrored in these men. 4 Past all 
your influences, your home river, 5 constellations of cities, mottoes 
of childhood, 6 parents and easy cures, war, all evasion's 
wishes. 7 What one word must never be said? 8 
Dead, and these men fight off our dying, 9 cough 
in the theatres of the war. 10 What two things 
shall never be seen? 11 They : what we did. 
Enemy : what we mean. 12 This is a nation's 
scene and halfway house. 13 What three things can never 
be done? 14 Forget. Keep silent. Stand alone. 15 The 
hills of glass, the fatal brilliant plain. 16 The facts 
of war forced into actual grace. 17 Seasons and modern 
glory. Told in the histories, 18 how first ships came 
19 seeing on the Atlantic thirteen clouds 20 lining the 
west horizon with their white 21 shining halations; 22 they 
conquered, throwing off impossible Europe--- 23 could not be used 
to transform; created coast--- 24 breathed-in America. 25 See how 
they took the land, made after-life 26 fresh out of 
exile, planted the pioneer 27 base and blockade, 28 pushed 
forests down in an implacable walk 29 west where new 
clouds lay at the desirable 30 body of sunset; 31 
taking the seaboard. Replaced the isolation, 32 dropped cities where 
they stood, drew a tidewater 33 frontier of Europe, 34 
a moment, and another frontier held, 35 this land was 
planted home-land that we know. 36 Ridge of discovery, 37 
until we walk to windows, seeing America 38 lie in 
a photograph of power, widened 39 before our forehead, 40 
and still behind us falls another glory, 41 London unshaken, 
the long French road to Spain, 42 the old Mediterranean 
43 flashing new signals from the hero hills 44 near 
Barcelona, monuments and powers, 45 parent defenses. 46 Before our 
face the broad and concrete west, 47 green ripened field, 
frontier pushed back like river 48 controlled and dammed; 49 
the flashing wheatfields, cities, lunar plains 50 grey in Nevada, 
the sane fantastic country 51 sharp in the south, 52 
liveoak, the hanging moss, a world of desert, 53 the 
dead, the lava, and the extreme arisen 54 fountains of 
life, 55 the flourished land, peopled with watercourses 56 to 
California and the colored sea; 57 sums of frontiers 58 
and unmade boundaries of acts and poems, 59 the brilliant 
scene between the seas, and standing, 60 this fact and 
this disease. 61 Half-memories absorb us, and our ritual world 
62 carries its history in familiar eyes, 63 planted in 
flesh it signifies its music 64 in minds which turn 
to sleep and memory, 65 in music knowing all the 
shimmering names, 66 the spear, the castle, and the rose. 
67 But planted in our flesh these valleys stand, 68 
everywhere we begin to know the illness, 69 are forced 
up, and our times confirm us all. 70 In the 
museum life, centuries of ambition 71 yielded at last a 
fertilizing image: 72 the Carthaginian stone meaning a tall woman 
73 carries in her two hands the book and cradled 
dove, 74 on her two thighs, wings folded from the 
waist 75 cross to her feet, a pointed human crown. 
76 This valley is given to us like a glory. 
77 To friends in the old world, and their lifting 
hands 78 that call for intercession. Blow falling full in 
face. 79 All those whose childhood made learn skill to 
meet, 80 and art to see after the change of 
heart; 81 all the belligerents who know the world. 82 
You standing over gorges, surveyors and planners, 83 you workers 
and hope of countries, first among powers; 84 you who 
give peace and bodily repose. 85 opening landscapes by grace, 
giving the marvel lowlands 86 physical peace, flooding old battlefields 
87 with general brilliance, who best love your lives; 88 
and you young, you who finishing the poem 89 wish 
new perfection and begin to make; 90 you men of 
fact, measure our times again. 91 These are our strength, 
who strike against history. 92 These whose corrupt cells owe 
their new styles of weakness 93 to our diseases; 94 
these carrying light for safety on their foreheads 95 descended 
deeper for richer faults of ore, 96 drilling their death. 
97 These touching radium and the luminous poison, 98 carried 
their death on their lips and with their warning 99 
glow in their graves. 100 These weave and their eyes 
water and rust away, 101 these stand at wheels until 
their brains corrode, 102 these farm and starve, 103 all 
these men cry their doom across the world, 104 meeting 
avoidable death, fight against madness, 105 find every war. 106 
Are known as strikers, soldiers, pioneers, 107 fight on all 
new frontiers, are set in solid 108 lines of defense. 
109 Defense is sight; widen the lens and see 110 
standing over the land myths of identity, 111 new signals, 
processes: 112 Alloys begin : certain dominant metals. 113 Deliberate 
combines add new qualities, 114 sums of new uses. 115 
Over the country, from islands of Maine fading, 116 Cape 
Sable fading south into the orange 117 detail of sunset, 
118 new processes, new signals, new possession. 119 A name 
for all the conquests, prediction of victory 120 deep in 
these powers. 121 Carry abroad the urgent need, the scene, 
122 to photograph and to extend the voice, 123 to 
speak this meaning. 124 Voices to speak to us directly. 
As we move. 125 As we enrich, growing in larger 
motion, 126 this word, this power. 127 Down coasts of 
taken countries, mastery, 128 discovery at one hand, and at 
the other 129 frontiers and forests, 130 fanatic cruel legend 
at our back and 131 speeding ahead the red and 
open west, 132 and this our region, 133 desire, field, 
beginning. Name and road, 134 communication to these many men, 
135 as epilogue, seeds of unending love.
