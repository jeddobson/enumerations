1 In the cave with a long-ago flare 2 a 
woman stands, her arm up. Red twig, black twig, brown 
3 twig. 4 A wall of leaping darkness over her. 
5 The men are out hunting in the early light 
6 But here in this flicker, one or two men, 
painting 7 and a woman among them. 8 Great living 
animals grow on the stone walls, 9 their pelts, their 
eyes, their sex, their hearts, 10 and the cave-painters touch 
them with life, red, brown, black, 11 a woman among 
them, painting.
