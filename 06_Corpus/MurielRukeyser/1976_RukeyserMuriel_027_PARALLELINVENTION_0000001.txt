1 We in our season like progress and inventions. 2 
The inventor is really the invention. 3 But who made 
the inventions? To what uses 4 Were they put, by 
whom, and for what purposes? 5 You made an innovation 
and then 6 did you give it to me without 
writing it down? 7 Did you give it to her, 
too? 8 Did I develop it and give it to 
him, 9 or to her, or to them? 10 Did 
you quicken communication, 11 Did you central-control? And war? And 
the soul? 12 Let's not talk about communication 13 any 
more. 14 Did we deepen our integration ties 15 did 
we subsequently grow--- 16 in strength? in complexity? 17 Or 
did we think of doing the same things 18 at 
the same time and do them to each other? 19 
And then out of our lovemaking 20 emergence of priests 
and kings, 21 out of our smiles and twists 22 
full-time craft specialists, 23 out of our mouths and asses 
24 division into social classes, 25 art and architecture and 
writing 26 from meditation and delighting 27 from our terrors 
and our pities 28 "of course," you say, "the growth 
of cities." 29 But parallels do not imply 30 identities---there 
is no iron law; 31 we are richly variable 32 
levels of heaven and levels of hell; 33 ripples of 
change out from the center 34 of me, of you, 
of love the inventor. 1
