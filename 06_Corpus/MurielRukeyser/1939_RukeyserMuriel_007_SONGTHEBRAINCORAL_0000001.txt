1 Lie still, be still, love, be thou not shaken, 
2 it is for me to be shaken, 3 to 
bring tokens. 4 Among the yellow light in the hot 
gardens, 5 the thinned green light in the evening gardens, 
6 I speak of gladness. 7 Let the green night, 
wearing its moods and shadows 8 find us so, stilled 
within its varied shadows 9 falling like feathers. 10 We 
change in images, color, visions, and change; 11 I bring 
you, speak you now a changeless stone, 12 the strange 
brain-coral, 13 thrown white on beaches beside the peacock Stream. 
14 Lie still, love, while the many physical worlds stream 
15 passionate by, 16 in dreams of the exterior intricate 
rainbow world, 17 dreaming the still white intricate stone of 
the world, 18 ---bring you brain-coral, 19 a world's white 
seeming.
