1 Everything here is real and of our joy. 2 
The rivers are real, they come bringing their colors, 3 
The lives flow through us too in meaning, in form 
4 Which is meaning and motion. Nothing here is unreal. 
5 The beginning is giving; and the land is wide. 
6 Daring of voices and faces, the moment being in 
flow, 7 Our selves being now, we and our word 
alive. 8 Throw away the code : there is no 
success or failure, 9 You will move through success and 
you will never fail, 10 For if you take the 
steps and take the songs 11 You will be changed 
in the taking 12 As if changed by song. 13 
It will sing in your waking, 14 And in your 
rest 15 Breathe with your breathing--- 16 Making, will break 
and make. 17 The masks of the beginning and the 
end 18 At last have begun to move. They move 
away. 19 The songs of your lifetime sing and say 
and relate: 20 You are the beginning, as you are 
the end. 21 The song is song, it sings, and 
it is real.
