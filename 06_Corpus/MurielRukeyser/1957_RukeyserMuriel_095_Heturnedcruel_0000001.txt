He turned cruel. Absorbed in his own cruelty, he drove 
the children, drove them by will, goading their wills, manipulating 
everything they began to do. He turned into a dark 
leader, small and ferocious. And they were fascinated. They followed. 
He drove them as if with whips into a dance; 
and they ran, dancing and hypnotized. He was full of 
hatred. He was in torment, hating and defying his grownups, 
goading his generation to frenzy. For a while, for a 
short while, it was full cruelty. Assailed he was, with 
danger over his life-space. Fretful he was, restless and stern, 
the artificial boasting king. Loud and unreal to himself, with 
all his conflict packed for him to carry, and the 
admiring, the pity of the adults, out of reach. But 
at the moment at which the grownups would have stopped 
it, at the moment when the five-year-olds would have turned 
on Paul, it was as if he remembered. He was 
on his journey, he was moving toward his world. The 
long exchange with Miss Lor- ence---her cheek bent over him 
as he lay himself down, her short soft questions, the 
open feeling of her answers, came back to him like 
Eden. It had always been there. And his own people, 
the five-year-olds! He remembered the other life: communication. He turned 
back to his own group with his whole life in 
his act of choice.
