1 No one ever walking this our only earth, various, 
very clouded, 2 in our forests, in all the valleys 
of our early dreams, 3 No one has ever for 
long seen any thing in full, not live 4 As 
any one river or man has run his changes, child 
5 Of the swarms and sowings. Death nor the woman, 
seed 6 Of the born, all growing, going through the 
grass. 7 However deep you have looked into the well 
of the cradle 8 Or into any dream or open 
eyed the grave 9 While the soul, many-leaved and waiting, 
10 Began to assume another exact flower. 11 Smoke and 
smell in the wind, a single life! 12 However true 
you tell, you never have told. 13 And even that 
is not altogether true. It changes, we say, changes, 14 
for yes, 15 Indeed we all know this, any, any 
of us, there are secrets known 16 to all. 17 
Was it indeed shown you in a flash of journey, 
the flicker along 18 change? 19 In the fine shadow 
between the curve of lips, shadow of days 20 lengthening, 
21 In the flicker of meaning revealed by many windows; 
22 In the form of the eye, the form of 
words, of the word; meaning 23 that formed 24 These 
marvelous genitals, nameless as God; 25 Or in the informing 
light behind his dream, and he was dreaming 26 of 
you. 27 Did his own self escape him, now to 
reach us, reaving the edge 28 of cloud? 29 Has 
a gift then been given, each other giving our lives? 
30 As air is given to the mouth of all?
