1 This is what lit the hunters of smoke and 
the paths of the forest. 2 The tracking and the 
advantage of the steaming quarry, 3 This is what the 
pillars of fluted thought, the image vibrating 4 through all 
the dances to the unknown where the leap is, 5 
This is what the event and the battle-rags, the women 
secret in 6 their suffering, the long rages of the 
pioneers, the glory standing 7 over a final valley, 8 
This is what they led to in their charts of 
vision : the sweat of 9 bargaining and the smoky 
gold eagles, 10 The indirect lighting and the gamblers' despair. 
11 Shifting landscapes of a Convention Hall. 12 This is 
a bazaar where there are nothing but drugstores 13 Each 
one has a single drug tested only on mandrills. 14 
This is a dry arroyo expecting the avalanche, 15 Thirty-seven 
men offering foolproof ways of survival. 16 They trade their 
partisans. That is their method of choice. 17 When they 
say survival, they do not mean living under the 18 
avalanche. 19 They do not recognize the existence of the 
avalanche. 20 They mean how to set up shop in 
the arroyo, 21 And show a profit after the first 
six months.
