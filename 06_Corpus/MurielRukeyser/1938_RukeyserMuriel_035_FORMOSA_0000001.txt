1 The sand's still blue with receding water, sky topples 
2 its last brightness 3 down, day diminishing; two fishermen 
4 walk over the sandbar, their thin indicative shadows 5 
pointing tomorrow's sunrise on the whiteline horizon. 6 Tomorrow is 
only an interval, night's passing interval 7 cruises on open 
water here, anchored, while peace comes in. 8 Speedboat, run 
again before your smoking white 9 wake, while the light's 
collected on the hull, 10 until the evening turns, engaged 
with night. 11 The little dog races over the sandflats, 
the thin bathers 12 turn back to foamline, half-light discourages 
their daring 13 sea-dream. End it! omens are laughter, gay 
all morning, 14 gay before ogre midnight, spurless midnight--- 15 
midnight's an interval, darkness is promise, night's nothing, 16 nightmare 
is nothing, nothing but interval. 17 Eliminate all dreams : 
here, real : love come, high tide, 18 the risen, 
freehold moon, the fortunate island, 19 resting, blue-flooded, rests, delicately, 
the sea.
