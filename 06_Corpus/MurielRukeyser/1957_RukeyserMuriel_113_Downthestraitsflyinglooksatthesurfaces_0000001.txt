1 Down the straits flying, looks at the surfaces. 2 
Down, staring down, he sees the narrow places, 3 The 
opposites and the space between opposites. 4 He sees his 
legs and his feet; his big hands moving. 5 A 
narrow place like the road like the endless channel 6 
Yellowing his shoulders with mortality; 7 Narrow as the knife 
of his life and death, a blade of rail along 
8 which he ran, and they shot at him. 9 
Narrow, a running spark between opposites. 10 He stretches, a 
big man in a plane. He thinks of a woman 
11 Who is a sea of meanings, whose flower of 
rivers 12 He knows as a speaking of dreams. He 
wants his speaking 13 Out into darkness like a speaking 
to one woman. 14 Forever; whether it be narrow; whether 
it be his death 15 ---A clenching of the heart, 
in an instant hidden--- 16 Or whether his life, a 
spark between opposites. 17 Striking a firefall in which there 
flare no fears 18 Doubled, no poles, for between runs 
fire. 19 The journey is his; how can his voice 
be him? 20 My voice, my life, he knows; my 
life, my home.
