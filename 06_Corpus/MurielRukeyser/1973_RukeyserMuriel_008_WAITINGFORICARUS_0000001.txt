1 He said he would be back and we'd drink 
wine together 2 He said that everything would be better 
than before 3 He said we were on the edge 
of a new relation 4 He said he would never 
again cringe before his father 5 He said that he 
was going to invent full-time 6 He said he loved 
me that going into me 7 He said was going 
into the world and the sky 8 He said all 
the buckles were very firm 9 He said the wax 
was the best wax 10 He said Wait for me 
here on the beach 11 He said Just don't cry 
12 I remember the gulls and the waves 13 I 
remember the islands going dark on the sea 14 I 
remember the girls laughing 15 I remember they said he 
only wanted to get away from me 16 I remember 
mother saying : Inventors are like poets, 17 a trashy 
lot 18 I remember she told me those who try 
out inventions are 19 worse 20 I remember she added 
: Women who love such are the worst 21 of 
all 22 I have been waiting all day, or perhaps 
longer. 23 I would have liked to try those wings 
myself. 24 It would have been better than this.
