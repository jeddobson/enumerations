1 When the half-body dies its frightful death 2 forked 
pain, infection of snakes, lightning, pull down the 3 voice. 
Waking 4 and I begin to climb the mountain on 
my mouth, 5 word by stammer, walk stammered, the lurching 
deck of earth. 6 Left-right with none of my own 
rhythms. 7 the long-established sex and poetry. 8 I go 
running in sleep, 9 but waking stumble down corridors of 
self, all rhythms gone. 10 The broken movement of love 
sex out of rhythm 11 one halted name in a 
shattered language 12 ruin of French-blue lights behind the eyes 
13 slowly the left hand extends a hundred feet 14 
and the right hand follows follows 15 but still the 
power of sight is very weak 16 but I go 
rolling this ball of life, it rolls 17 and I 
follow it whole up the slowly-brightening slope 18 A whisper 
attempts me, I whisper without stammer 19 I walk the 
long hall to the time of a metronome 20 set 
by a child's gun-target left-right 21 the power of eyesight 
is very slowly arriving 22 in this late impossible daybreak 
23 all the blue flowers open
