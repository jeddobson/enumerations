1 The father and mother sat, and the sister beside 
her. 2 I faced the two women across the table's 
width, 3 speaking, and all the time he looked at 
me, 4 sorrowing, saying nothing, with his hard tired breath. 
5 Their faces said : This is your home; and 
I : 6 I never come home, I never go 
away. 7 And they all answered : Stay. 8 All 
day the city turned about this room, 9 and silence 
had remained between our faces, 10 divisions outside to concentrate 
a world 11 tally here only to dead profits and 
losses. 12 We follow barrier voices, and we go fast, 
13 unknown to each other, they race, I turn away. 
14 No voice is strong enough to cry me Stay. 
15 My sister, I wished upon you those delights 16 
time never buries, 17 more precious than heroes. 18 Strange 
father, strange mother, who are you, who are you? 19 
Where have I come, 20 how shall I prosper home?
