1 Am I in your light? 2 No, go on 
reading 3 (the hackneyed light of evening quarrelling with the 
bulbs; 4 the book's bent rectangle solid on your knees) 
5 only my fingers in your hair, only, my eyes 
6 splitting the skull to tickle your brain with love 
7 in a slow caress blurring the mind, 8 kissing 
your mouth awake 9 opening the body's mouth and stopping 
the words. 10 This light is thick with birds, and 
11 evening warns us beautifully of death. 12 Slowly I 
bend over you, slowly your breath 13 runs rhythms through 
my blood 14 as if I said 15 I love 
you 16 and you should raise your head 17 listening, 
speaking into the covert night 18 : Did someone say 
something? 19 Love, am I in your light? 20 Am 
I? 21 Refrain See how love alters the living face 
22 go spin the immortal coin through time 23 watch 
the thing flip through space 24 tick tick25 We all 
had a good time 26 the throne was there and 
all 27 and there she was with that primitive unforgivable 
mouth 28 saying sophistications about nothing at all 29 as 
the young men cavorted up the room Darling 30 it's 
a swell party and those Martinis with 31 the olives 
so delicately soaked in alcohol 32 and William Flesh, the 
inventor, being cute 33 about the revolution and the Negro 
Question 34 until Dick said "Lynch the Jews!" (his name 
was Fleischman 35 but the war brought about a number 
of changes) 36 and the Objectivist poet fresh from Butte 
37 with his prePosterous suggestion.... 38 After a while, of 
course, we left. 39 the room was getting so jammed 
with editors. 40 And William and Maurice and Del and 
I 41 went back and we took turns using the 
couch with them. 42 We all had a good time 
43 and Del had hysterics at about 3 a.m. 44 
we dashed water into her face 45 I held her 
temples and Maurice said 46 what could we hope to 
look for next : 47 it's one thing to be 
faithful to the dead 48 (he said) but for her 
to stick to an oversexed 49 old fool : but 
she only laughed and cried and beat the floor 50 
until the neighbors rattled at the door. 51 Refrain Runnels 
of wine ran down his chin and laughter 52 softened 
his words until quite suddenly 53 the walls fell and 
the night stood blank and after 54 tick tick55 He 
turned the lights on and walked to the window : 
56 Son of a bitch : he said : if 
it isn't the reds again 57 parading through the streets 
with those lousy posters. 58 The Village was never like 
this in the old days, 59 throw a brick down 
the street and you'd hit a female poet 60 and 
life went on like a string of roller coasters. 61 
Workers of the world : 62 we've worked the world 
for all the damn thing's worth 63 tick tick 64 
I was little and they promised me the hills of 
glory 65 a great life and a sounding name on 
the earth : 66 tick tick 67 this is a 
different story. 68 Here's a list I've been making : 
reasons for living 69 on the right, reasons for my 
sudden death on the left. 70 Right now they balance 
so I could flip a coin 71 determine the imperative 
tonight 72 tick tick 73 flip that amazing coin through 
time and space this night 74 and the Village : 
and the army with banners 75 and the hot girls 
76 and the rotgut all gone 77 like a blown 
fuse : 78 I'd get a paragraph or two of 
news 79 obituary as a shutting door 80 meaning no 
more 81 leaving the world to the sun and the 
workers 82 the straight beautiful children the coins the clocks 
83 tick tick
