for Bernard Perlin 1 Now he has become one who 
upon that coast 2 landed by night and found the 
starving army 3 Fed on their cheese and wine. In 
those ravines 4 hidden by orphaned furious children lay 5 
while cries and wounds and hour past hour of war 
6 flamed past the broken pillars of that sky. 7 
He saw the enemy. His head is full of faces--- 
8 the living, the brave, a pure blazing alone 9 
to fight a domination to the end. 10 And now 
he sees the rigid terrible friend 11 inert, peopled by 
armies, winning. Now 12 he has become one given his 
life by those 13 fighting in Greece forever under a 
star 14 and now he knows how many wars there 
are.
