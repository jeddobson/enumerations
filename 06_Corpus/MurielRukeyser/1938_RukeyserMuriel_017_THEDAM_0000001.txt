1 All power is saved, having to end. Rises 2 
in the green season, in the sudden season 3 the 
white the budded 4 and the lost. 5 Water celebrates, 
yielding continually 6 sheeted and fast in its overfall 7 
slips, down : he rock, evades the pillars 8 building 
its colonnades, repairs 9 in stream and standing wave 10 
retains its seaward green 11 broken by obstacle rock; falling, 
the water sheet 12 spouts, and the mind dances, excess 
of white. 13 White brilliant function of the land's disease. 
14 Many-spanned, lighted, the crest leans under 15 concrete arches 
and the channelled hills, 16 turns in the george toward 
its release; 17 kinetic and controlled, the sluice 18 urging 
the hollow, the thunder, 19 the major climax 20 energy 
21 total and open watercourse 22 praising the spillway, fiery 
glaze, 23 crackle of light, cleanest velocity 24 flooding, the 
moulded force. 25 I open out a way over the 
water 26 I form a path between the Combatant : 
27 Grant that I sail down like a living bird, 
28 power over the fields and Pool of Fire. 29 
Phoenix, I sail over the phoenix world. 30 Diverted water, 
the fern and fuming white 31 ascend in mist of 
continuous diffusion. 32 Rivers are turning inside their mountains, 33 
streams line the stone, rest at the overflow 34 lake 
and in lanes of pliant color lie. 35 Blessing of 
this innumerable silver, 36 printed in silver, images of stone 
37 walk on a screen of falling water 38 in 
film-silver in continual change 39 recurring colored, plunging with the 
wave. 40 Constellations of light, abundance of many rivers. 41 
The sheeted island-cities, the white surf filling west, 42 the 
hope, fast water spilled where still pools fed. 43 Great 
power flying deep: between the rock and the sunset, 44 
the caretaker's house and the steep abutment, 45 hypnotic water 
fallen and the tunnels under 46 the moist and fragile 
galleries of stone, 47 mile-long, under the wave. Whether snow 
fall, 48 the quick light fall, years of white cities 
fall, 49 flood that this valley built falls slipping down 
50 the green turn in the river's green. 51 Steep 
gorge, the wedge of crystal in the sky. 52 How 
many feet of whirlpools? 53 What is a year in 
terms of falling water? 54 Cylinders; kilowatts; capacities. 55 Continuity: 
Q = 0 56 Equations for falling water. The streaming 
motion. 57 The balance-sheet of energy that flows 58 passing 
along its infinite barrier. 59 It breaks the hills, cracking 
the riches wide, 60 runs through electric wires; 61 it 
comes, warning the night, 62 running among these rigid hills, 
63 a single force to waken our eyes. 64 They 
poured the concrete and the columns stood, 65 laid bare 
the bedrock, set the cells of steel, 66 a dam 
for monument was what they hammered home. 67 Blasted, and 
stocks went up; 68 insured the base, 69 and limousines 
70 wrote their own graphs upon 71 roadbed and lifeline. 
72 Their hands touched mastery: 73 wait for defense, solid 
across the world. 74 Mr. Griswold. "A corporation is a 
body without a soul." 75 Mr. Dunn. When they were 
caught at it they resorted to the 76 methods employed 
by gunmen, ordinary machine gun racke- 77 teers. They cowardly 
tried to buy out the people who had the 78 
information on them. 79 Mr. Marcantonio. I agree that a 
racket has been practised, but the 80 most damnable racketeering 
that I have ever known is the 81 paying of 
a fee to the very attorney who represented these 82 
victims. That is the most outrageous racket that has ever 
come 83 within my knowledge. 84 Miss Allen. Mr. Jesse 
J. Ricks, the president of the Union Carbide 85 & 
Carbon Corporation, suggested that the stockholder had 86 better take 
this question up in a private conference. 87 The dam 
is safe. A scene of power. 88 The dam is 
the father of the tunnel. 89 This is the valley's 
work, the white, the shining. 90 The dam is used 
when the tunnel is used. 91 The men and the 
water are never idle, 92 have definitions. 93 This is 
a perfect fluid, having no age nor hours, 94 surviving 
scarless, unaltered, loving rest, 95 willing to run forever to 
find its peace 96 in equal seas in currents of 
still glass. 97 Effects of friction: to fight and pass 
again, 98 learning its power, conquering boundaries, 99 able to 
rise blind in revolts of tide, 100 broken and sacrificed 
to flow resumed. 101 Collecting eternally power. Spender of power, 
102 torn, never can be killed, speeded in filaments, 103 
million, its power can rest and rise forever, 104 wait 
and be flexible. Be born again. 105 Nothing is lost, 
even among the wars, 106 imperfect flow, confusion of force. 
107 It will rise. These are the phases of its 
face. 108 It knows its seasons, the waiting, the sudden. 
109 It changes. It does not die.
