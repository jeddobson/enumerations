1 Never to hear, I know in myself complete 2 
that naked integrated music; now 3 it has become me, 
now it is nerve, song, gut, 4 and my gross 
hand writes only through Mozart; see 5 even in withholding 
what you have brought to me. 6 Renewed, foolish, reconciled 
to myself, I walk 7 this winter-country, I fly over 
its still-flock'd clouds, 8 always in my isolated flesh I 
take 9 that theme's light certainty of absolute purpose 10 
to make quick spirit when spirit most might break. 11 
Naked you walked through my body and I turned 12 
to you with this far music you now withhold. 13 
O my destroyed hope! Though I never again 14 hear 
developing heaven, the growing grave-bearing earth, 15 my poem, my 
promise, my love, my sleep after love; 16 my hours, 
listening, along that music move, 17 and have been saved 
and hardly know the cold.
