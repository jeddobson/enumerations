1 Let her be seen, a voice on a platform, 
heard 2 as a city is heard in its prophetic 
sleep when 3 one shadow hangs over one side of 
a total wall 4 of houses, factories, stacks, and on 
the faces 5 around her tallies, shadow from one form. 
6 An open square shields the voice, reflecting it 7 
to faces who receive its reflections of light as 8 
change on their features. She stands alone, sending 9 her 
voice out to the edges, seeing approach people 10 to 
make the ring ragged, to fill in blacker 11 answers. 
12 This is an open square of the lit world 
13 whose dark sky over hills rimmed white with evening 
14 squares lofts where sunset lies in dirty patterns 15 
and rivers of mill-towns beating their broken bridges 16 as 
under another country full of air. 17 Dark offices evening 
reaches where letters take the light 18 even from palest 
faces over script. 19 Many abandon machines, shut off the 
looms, 20 hurry on glooming cobbles to the square. And 
many 21 are absent, as in the sky about her 
face, the birds 22 retreat from charcoal rivers and fly 
far. 23 The words cluster about the superstition mountains. 24 
The sky breaks back over the torn and timid 25 
her early city whose stacks along the river 26 flourished 
darkness over all, whose mottled sky 27 shielded the faces 
of those asleep in doorways 28 spread dark on narrow 
fields through which the father 29 comes home without meat, 
the forest in the ground 30 whose trees are coal, 
the lurching roads of autumn 31 where the flesh of 
the eager hangs, heavier by 32 its thirty bullets, barbed 
on wire. Truckdrivers 33 swing ungrazed trailers past, the woman 
in the fog 34 can never speak her poems of 
unemployment, 35 the brakeman slows the last freight round the 
curve. 36 And riveters in their hardshell fling short fiery 
37 steel, and the servant groans in his narrow room, 
38 and the girl limps away from the door of 
the shady doctor. 39 Or the child new-born into a 
company town 40 whose life can be seen at birth 
as child, woman, widow. 41 The neighbor called in to 
nurse the baby of a spy, 42 the schoolboy washing 
off the painted word 43 "scab" on the front stoop, 
his mother watering flowers 44 pouring the milk-bottle of water 
from the ledge, 45 who stops in horror, seeing. The 
grandmother going 46 down to her cellar with a full 
clothes-basket, 47 turns at the shot, sees men running past 
brick, 48 smoke-spurt and fallen face. 49 She speaks of 
these: 50 the chase down through the canal, the filling-station, 
51 stones through the windshield. The woman in the bank 
52 who topples, the premature birth brought on by tear-gas, 
53 the charge leaving its gun slow-motion, finding those 54 
who sit at windows knowing what they see; 55 who 
look up at the door, the brutalized face appraising 56 
strangers with holsters; little blackened boys 57 with their animal 
grins, quick hands salvaging coal 58 among the slag of 
patriotic hills. 59 She knows the field of faces at 
her feet, 60 remembrances of childhood, likenesses of parents, 61 
a system of looms in constellation whirled, 62 disasters dancing. 
63 And behind her head 64 the world of the 
unpossessed, steel mills in snow flaming, 65 nine o'clock towns 
whose deputies' overnight power 66 hurls waste into killed eyes, 
whose guns predict 67 mirages of order, an empty coat 
before the blind. 68 Doorways within which nobody is at 
home. 69 The spies who wait for the spy at 
the deserted crossing, 70 a little dead since they are 
going to kill. 71 Those women who stitch their lives 
to their machines 72 and daughters at the symmetry of 
looms. 73 She speaks to the ten greatest American women: 
74 The anonymous farmer's wife, the anonymous clubbed picket, 75 
the anonymous Negro woman who held off the guns, 76 
the anonymous prisoner, anonymous cotton-picker 77 trailing her robe of 
sack in a proud train, 78 anonymous writer of these 
and mill-hand, anonymous city walker, 79 anonymous organizer, anonymous binder 
of the illegally 80 wounded, 81 anonymous feeder and speaker 
to anonymous squares. 82 She knows their faces, their impatient 
songs 83 of passionate grief risen, the desperate music 84 
poverty makes, she knows women cut down 85 by poverty, 
by stupid obscure days, 86 their moments over the dishes, 
speaks them now, 87 wrecks with the whole necessity of 
the past 88 behind the debris, behind the ordinary 89 
smell of coffee, the ravelling clean wash, 90 the turning 
to bed, undone among savage night 91 planning and unplanning 
seasons of happiness 92 broken in dreams or in the 
jaundiced morning 93 over a tub or over a loom 
or over 94 the tired face of death. 95 She 
knows 96 the songs : Hope to die, Mo I 
try, I comes out, 97 Owin boss mo, I comes 
out, Lawd, Owin boss mo 98 food, money and life. 
99 Praise breakers, 100 praise the unpraised who cannot speak 
their name. 101 Their asking what they need as unbelieved 
102 as a statue talking to a skeleton. 103 They 
are the animals who devour their mother 104 from need, 
and they know in their bodies other places, 105 their 
minds are cities whose avenues are named 106 each after 
a foreign city. They fall when cities fall. 107 They 
have the cruelty and sympathy of those 108 whose texture 
is the stress of existence woven 109 into revenge, the 
crime we all must claim. 110 They hold the old 
world in their new world's arms. 111 And they are 
the victims, all the splinters of war 112 run through 
their eyes, their black escaping face 113 and runaway eyes 
are the Negro in the subway 114 whose shadowy detective
