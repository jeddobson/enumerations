1 What do you know of America? I asked a 
little Russian schoolgirl. 2 ---Money, fat men, skyscrapers, lots of 
ships and airplanes. 3 And what do you think of 
America? I asked her father. 4 He thought a little, 
then said, A land where democracy 5 Will at last 
break down injustice, where many shrewd eyes 6 Look steadily 
and with hope into the future; 7 A land of 
brilliant techniques and plenty, 8 And of people who, like 
us, 9 Strive to a distant point.
