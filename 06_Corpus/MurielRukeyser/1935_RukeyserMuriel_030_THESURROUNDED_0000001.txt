1 They escape before, but their shadows walk behind, 2 
filling the city with formidable dark, 3 spilling black over 
the sun's run gold, speeding a rumor 4 of warfare 
and the sciences of death, and work 5 of treason 
and exposure, following 6 me for an easy mark. 7 
The sky is travelled by brightness, clouds ignite, 8 flame 
is incised upon the martyred air ; 9 the city 
dissolves in foaming craters, stars 10 falling in multitudes dazzle 
the sky with fire, 11 and I pursue them, I 
am pursued, and 12 they are everywhere. 13 Now there 
is no more brightness, and no shadow 14 but the 
shadow of a thought, and I'm in jail enough 15 
to know conviction with prisoner certainty, 16 haunted by protest, 
lacking completion's proof 17 surrounded by shadows 18 more plausible 
than love.
