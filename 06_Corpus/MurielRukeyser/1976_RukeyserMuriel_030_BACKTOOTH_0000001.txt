1 My large back tooth, without a mate for years, 
2 at last has been given one. The dentist ground 
her down 3 a bit. She had been growing wild, 
nothing to meet her, keep 4 her sane. 5 Now 
she fits the new one, they work together, sleep together, 
6 she is a little diminished but functioning, all night 
all day.
