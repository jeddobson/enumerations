1 Believing in those inexorable laws 2 After long rebellion 
and long discipline 3 I am cut down to the 
moment in all my flaws 4 Creeping to the feet 
of my master the sun 5 On the sea-beach, tides 
beaten by the moon woman, 6 And will not think 
of you, but lie at my full length 7 Among 
the great breakers. I find the clear outwater 8 Shine 
crash speaking of truth behind the law. 9 The many-following 
waves turn into you. 10 I see in vision that 
northern bay : pines, villages, 11 And the flat water 
suddenly rears up 12 The high wave races against all 
edicts, taller, 13 Finally powerful. Water becomes your mouth, 14 
And all laws all polarities your truth.
