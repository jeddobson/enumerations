1 Now that the river has changed, my dear, 2 
And summer has changed and the winter weather, 3 I 
cannot foretell three days together, 4 I cannot foretell two 
days, my dear. 5 In the hills or in the 
town 6 The landmarks are all gone and down, 7 
The signs are new and strange, my dear, 8 The 
signs are new and strange 9 And how shall I 
foretell, my dear? 10 What one thing do you need 
to hear? 11 What shall I say will come? ---Change.
