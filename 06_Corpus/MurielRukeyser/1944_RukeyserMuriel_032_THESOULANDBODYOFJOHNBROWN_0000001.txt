Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! Joel III : 
14 1 His life is in the body of the 
living. 2 When they hanged him the first time, his 
image leaped 3 into the blackened air. His grave was 
the floating faces 4 of the crowd, and he refusing 
them release 5 rose open-eyed in autumn, a fanatic 6 
beacon of fierceness leaping to meet them there, 7 match 
the white prophets of the storm, 8 the streaming meteors 
of the war. 9 Dreaming Ezekiel, threaten me alive! 10 
Voices: Why don't you rip up that guitar? 11 Or 
must we listen to those blistering strings? 12 The trial 
of heroes follows their execution. The striding 13 wind of 
nations with new rain, new lightning, 14 destroyed in magnificent 
noon shining straight down 15 the fiery pines. Brown wanted 
freedom. Could not himself be free 16 until more grace 
reached a corroded world. Our guilt his own. 17 Under 
the hooded century drops the trap--- 18 There in October's 
fruition-fire three 19 tall images of him, Brown as he 
stood on the ground, 20 Brown as he stood on 
sudden air, Brown 21 standing to our fatal topmost hills 
22 faded through dying altitudes, and low 23 through faces 
living under the dregs of the air, 24 deprived childhood 
and thwarted youth and change: 25 fantastic sweetness gone to 
rags 26 and incorruptible anger blurred by age. 27 Compel 
the steps of lovers, watch them lie silvery 28 attractive 
in naked embrace over the brilliant gorge, 29 and open 
them to love: enlarge their welcome 30 to sharp-faced countrysides, 
vicious familiar windows 31 whose lopped-off worlds say I am 
promise, holding 32 stopgap slogans of a thin season's offering, 
33 false initials, blind address, dummy name--- 34 enemies who 
reply in smiles; mild slavers; moderate whores. 35 There is 
another gorge to remember, where soldiers give 36 terrible answers 
of lechery after death. 37 Brown said at last, with 
a living look, 38 "I designed to have done the 
same thing 39 again on a larger scale." Brown sees 
his tree 40 grow in the land to leap these 
mountains. 41 Not mountains, but men and women sleeping. 42 
O my scene! my mother! 43 America who offers many 
births. 44 Over the tier of barriers, compel the connected 
steps 45 past the attacks of sympathy, past black capitals, 
46 to arrive with horizon sharpness, marching 47 in quick 
embrace toward people 48 faltering among hills among the symptoms 
of ice, 49 small lights of the shifting winter, the 
rapid snow-blue stars. 50 This must be done by armies. 
Nothing is free. 51 Brown refuses to speak direct again, 
52 "If I tell them the truth, 53 they will 
say I speak in symbols." 54 White landscapes emphasize his 
nakedness 55 reflected in counties of naked who shiver at 
fires, 56 their backs to the hands that unroll worlds 
around them. 57 They go down the valleys. They shamble 
in the streets, 58 Blind to the sun-storming image in 
their eyes. 59 They dread the surface of their victim 
life, 60 lying helpless and savage in shade parks, 61 
asking the towers only what beggars dare : 62 food, 
fire, water, and air. 63 Spring: the great hieroglyph : 
the mighty, whose first hour 64 collects the winter invalids, 
whose cloudless 65 pastures train swarms of mutable apple-trees 66 
to blond delusions of light, the touch of whiter 67 
more memorable breasts each evening, the resistant 68 male shoulders 
riding under sold terrible eyes. 69 The soldier-face persists, the 
victorious head 70 asks, kissing those breasts, more miracles--- 71 
Untarnished hair! Set them free! "Without the snap of a 
gun---" 72 More failures---but the season is a garden after 
sickness; 73 Then the song begins, 74 "The clearing of 
the sky 75 brings fulness to heroes--- 76 Call Death 
out of the city 77 and ring the summer in." 
78 Whether they sleep alone. Whether they understand darkness 79 
of mine or tunnel or store. Whether they lay branches 
80 with skill to entice their visions out of fire. 
81 Whether she lie awake, whether he walk in guilt 
82 down padded corridors, leaving no fingerprints. 83 Whether he 
weaken searching for power in papers, 84 or shut out 
every fantasy but the fragile eyelid to 85 commemorate delight 
... 86 They believe in their dreams. 87 They more 
and more, secretly, tell their dreams. 88 They listen oftener 
for certain words, look deeper 89 in faces for features 
of one remembered image. 90 They almost forget the face. 
They cannot miss the look. 91 It waits until faces 
have gathered darkness, 92 and country guitars a wide and 
subtle music. 93 It rouses love. It has mastered its 
origin: 94 Death was its method. It will surpass its 
95 furious birth when it is known again. 96 Dreaming 
Ezekiel, threaten me alive! 97 Greengrown with sun on it. 
All the living summer. 98 They tell their dreams on 
the cool hill reclining 99 after a twilight daytime painting 
machines on the sky, 100 the spite of tractors and 
the toothless cannon. 101 Slaves under factories deal out identical 
102 gestures of reaching---cathedral-color-rose 103 resumes the bricks as the 
brick walls lean 104 away from the windows, blank in 
bellwavering air, 105 a slave's mechanical cat's-claw reaping sky. 106 
The cities of horror are down. These are called born, 
107 and Hungry Hill is a farm again. 108 I 
know your face, deepdrowned 109 prophet, and seablown eyes. 110 
Darkflowing peoples. A tall tree, prophet, fallen, 111 your arms 
in their flesh laid on the mountains, all 112 your 
branches in the scattered valleys down. 113 Your boughs lie 
broken in channels of the land, 114 dim anniversaries written 
on many clouds. 115 There is no partial help. Lost 
in the face of a child, 116 lost in the 
factory repetitions, lost 117 on the steel plateaus, in a 
ghost distorted. 118 Calling More Life. In all the harm 
calling. 119 Pointing disaster of death and lifting up the 
bone, 120 heroic drug and the intoxication gone. 121 I 
see your mouth calling 122 before the words arrive. 123 
Buzz of guitars repeat it in streamy 124 summernoon song, 
the whitelight of the meaning 125 changed to demand. More 
life, challenging 126 this hatred, this Hallelloo---risk it upon yourselves. 
127 Free all the dangers of promise, clear the image 
128 of freedom for the body of the world. 129 
After the tree is fallen and has become the land, 
130 when the hand in the earth declined rises and 
touches and 131 after the walls go down and all 
the faces turn, 132 the diamond shoals of eyes demanding 
life 133 deep in the prophet eyes, a wish to 
be again 134 threatened alive, in agonies of decision 135 
part of our nation of our fanatic sun.
