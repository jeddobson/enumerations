1 Gullies as deep as halls held these surveyors, 2 
Their bobs and blueprints. But men have drowned in the 
eaten 3 Land, the river ate them too. You know 
the river 4 Cannot be looked at unless you see 
the forest, 5 The forest will not speak until you 
call the people. 6 Look at these people's lives and 
you will see it clear. 7 After explosions filling these 
valleys, clear 8 Outlander voices ring across the sky, and 
people 9 Prepare to move the dead from the graves, 
the river 10 Is coming over the bottomland and forest, 
11 A little fightin creek would have eaten 12 The 
porch, the chickencoop, all but the surveyors. 13 The spools 
of cable, the pylons like surveyors 14 Walk, signal to 
the lives of all these people. 15 Their lives are 
real and face the tree of the forest, 16 And 
face the tree of time and the tree of the 
river 17 Singing a secret of growing and not being 
eaten 18 Until they are given as food. And the 
valley stands clear.
