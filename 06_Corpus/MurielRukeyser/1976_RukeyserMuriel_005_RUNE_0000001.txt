1 The word in the bread feeds me, 2 The 
word in the moon leads me, 3 The word in 
the seed breeds me, 4 The word in the child 
needs me. 5 The word in the sand builds me, 
6 The word in the fruit fills me, 7 The 
word in the body mills me, 8 The word in 
the war kills me. 9 The word in the man 
takes me, 10 The word in the storm shakes me, 
11 The word in the work makes me, 12 The 
word in the woman rakes me, 13 The word in 
the word wakes me.
