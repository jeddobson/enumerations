1 Up in the second balcony 2 the dark man's 
hand moves at his thigh, 3 he turns congested eyes 
to floor. 4 The crowd still stamps and brays for 
more : 5 Magenta flares strip grace away 6 peeling 
attraction down to this : 7 thighs' alternation, shrugging breasts, 
8 silk tapping the mons veneris ; 9 The adequate 
trough inclines and dips 10 rising venereally to view : 
11 stained by the shifting light to blue, 12 the 
pearl scarf simmers at her hips. 13 With each contraction 
of desire 14 the appealing flesh is whipped entire, 15 
ambushed in spasms. 16 In the street, 17 the raw 
light serves as index to 18 upturning avid faces who 
19 shine all the signals of defeat. 20 An army 
of horns moves up the hall, 21 drums hurry to 
their crisis where 22 awkward in fear, the audience 23 
at last confronts a dancer bare : 24 these naked 
multitudes exposed to her : 25 bright shoulders, glossy length 
of leg, 26 the lapsing beat persists, to beg 27 
salving of lives of these thighs' stir. 28 We are 
drenched in confusion, drowning among lights 29 that flare across 
stormed waters showing here 30 the faces pitiable with hesitation, 
31 eyes groaning past the corpse's sneer, 32 the twisted 
words of all the unlucky, spent 33 on brightened flesh 
of these impossible dear : 34 The blemished faces and 
impeccable thighs 35 are those we paint with lights to 
make us wise, 36 consigning our total beauty now to 
this : 37 the clutching loins and intolerable kiss.
