1 When the true things meet us at the place 
we reach, they are all 2 real, all dreams, 3 
Hidden by incident, often, they stand clear, here they are; 
4 The mottled frayed fish in the pool leaps, the 
magnificence, 5 Epiphany among the sparks and rags of God. 
6 Before the opening of the world, in our own 
time, 7 When the air we feed on gives us 
magnificence in conflict, 8 A naked man in this stream 
may leap, may pour his energy 9 Into all lives, 
pouring himself out on the forming light 10 Where power-crossed 
creatures soar, trees up and over us, 11 Our joy, 
our meaning, our love, even in dream. 12 To go 
to make to flow 13 To rise to break to 
grow 14 To shine and to stand; 15 To join 
and to separate 16 To give and to take 17 
To destroy and to defend 18 All beginning in end 
beginning 19 Spirit through world acting 20 World without end.
