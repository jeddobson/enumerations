1 Sunlight the tall women may never have seen. 2 
Men, perhaps, going headfirst into the breakers, 3 But certainly 
the children at the sandbar. 4 Shallow glints in the 
wave suspended 5 We knew at the breaker line, running 
that shore 6 At low tide, when it was safe. 
The grasses whipped 7 And nothing was what they said: 
not safety, nor the sea. 8 And the sand was 
not what they said, but various, 9 Lion-grained, beard-grey. And 
blue. And green. 10 And each grain casting its shadow 
down before 11 Childhood in tide-pools where all things are 
food. 12 Behind us the shores emerged and fed on 
tide. 13 We fed on summer, the round flowers in 
our hands 14 From the snowball bush entered us, and 
prisoner wings, 15 And shells in spirals, all food. 16 
All keys to unlock 17 Some world, glinting as strong 
as noon on the sandbar, 18 Where men and women 
give each other children.
