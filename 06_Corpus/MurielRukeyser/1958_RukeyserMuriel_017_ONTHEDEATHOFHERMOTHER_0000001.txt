1 A seacoast late at night and a wheel of 
wind. 2 All those years, Mother, your arms were full 
of absence 3 And all the running of arrows could 
never not once find 4 Anything but your panic among 
all that substance, 5 Until your wide eyes opened forever. 
Until it all was true. 6 The fears were true. 
In that cold country, winter, 7 The wordless king, went 
isolate and cruel, 8 And he alone real. His armies 
all that entered. 9 But here is peacock daybreak; thought-yoked 
and warm, 10 the light, 11 The cloud-companions and the 
greenest star. 12 Starflash on water; the embryo in the 
foam. 13 Dives through my body in the waking bright, 
14 Watchmen of birth; I see. You are here, Mother, 
and you are 15 Dead, and here is your gift: 
my life which is my home.
