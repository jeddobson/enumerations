life.246 All day the rain 247 all day waiting within 
the prison gate 248 before another prison gate 249 The 
house of the poet 250 He is in there somewhere 
251 among the muscular wardens 252 I have arrived at 
the house of the poet 253 in the mud in 
the interior music of all poems 254 and the grey 
rain of the world 255 whose gates do not open. 
256 I stand, and for this religion and that religion 
257 do not eat but remember all the things I 
know 258 and a strong infant beginning to run. 259 
Nothing is happening. Mud, silence, rain. 260 Near the end 
of the day 261 with the rain and the knowledge 
pulling at my legs 262 a movement behind me makes 
me move aside. 263 A bus full of people turns 
in the mud, drives to the gate. 264 The gate 
that never opens 265 opens at last. Beyond it, slender 
266 Chinese-red posts of the inner gates. 267 The gate 
of the house of the poet. 268 The bus is 
crowded, a rush-hour bus that waits. 269 Nobody moves. 270 
"Who are these people?" I say. 271 How can these 
gates open? 272 My new friend has run up beside 
me. 273 He has been standing guard in the far 
corner. 274 "They are prisoners," he says, "brought here from 
trial. 275 Don't you see? They are all tied together." 
276 Fool that I am! I had not seen the 
ropes, 277 down at their wrists in the crowded rush-hour 
bus. 278 The gates are open. The prisoners go in. 
279 The house of the poet who stays in solitary, 
280 not allowed reading not allowed writing 281 not allowed 
his woman his friends his unknown friends 282 and the 
strong infant beginning to run. 283 We go down the 
prison hill. On our right, sheds 284 full of people 
all leaning forward, blown on some ferry. 285 "They are 
the families of the prisoners. Some can visit. 286 They 
are waiting for their numbers to be called." 287 How 
shall we venture home? 288 How shall we tell each 
other of the poet? 289 How can we meet the 
judgment on the poet, 290 or his execution? How shall 
we free him? 291 How shall we speak to the 
infant beginning to run? 292 All those beginning to run?
