ever hold us? 138 Deeply night 139 found you intent 
upon this city river, 140 asleep at heart (turn light 
to her at last, 141 it shall be to her 
142 as wellwater) : 143 going all day along the 
gilded air 144 you saw at midnight 145 (going, down 
to the river, haunted by fog-horns) : 146 steam escaping 
over the spouting manhole, 147 a rout of white cats 
racing through the street. 148 Wet street, and the fight 
was ended there, 149 cats and that cock, fearful antagonists 
150 resolved in fog, a quick pack running uphill 151 
to a cock rigid with joy; running, but not to 
kill. 152 "Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third 
time, 153 Moby Dick!" --- Herman Melville 154 Moment of 
proof, when the body holds its vision, 155 masses recognize 
masses, knowledge without all end ; 156 face fathoms other 
face, all the hills open sunrise, 157 mouth sets on 
mouth ; Spring, and the tulips 158 totter in the 
wind. 159 Forfeit in love, forfeit in conflict, here 160 
met and at last marked clear in principle, 161 desire 
meets desire, the chase expands, and now 162 forever we 
course, knowing the marks of growth, 163 seeing the signals. 
164 Now we remember winter-tormented cities, 165 the August farm's 
overgrown hollow, thick with goldenrod, 166 the impetus of strain, 
and places where 167 love set its terminals, the vivid 
hunger 168 and satisfying food. 169 Mayday is moment of 
proof, when recognition 170 binds us in protest, binds us 
under a sun 171 of love and subtle thought and 
the ductile wish. 172 Tomorrow's Mayday. : How many are 
we? 173 We'll be everyone. 174 No hill can ever 
hold us, peak enlists peak, 175 climax forces out climax, 
proud cock, cats streaming, 176 poets and pickets contriving a 
valid country, 177 : Mayday moment, forever provoking new 178 
belief and blooming.
