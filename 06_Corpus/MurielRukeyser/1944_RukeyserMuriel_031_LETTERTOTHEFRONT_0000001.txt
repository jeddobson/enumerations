1 Women and poets see the truth arrive. 2 Then 
it is acted out, 3 The lives are lost, and 
all the newsboys shout. 4 Horror of cities follows, and 
the maze 5 Of compromise and grief. 6 The feeble 
cry Defeat be my belief. 7 All the strong agonized 
men 8 Wear the hard clothes of war, 9 Try 
to remember what they are fighting for. 10 But in 
dark weeping helpless moments of peace 11 Women and poets 
believe and resist forever : 12 The blind inventor finds 
the underground river.13 Even during war, moments of delicate peace 
14 Arrive; ceaseless the water ripples, love 15 Speaks through 
the river in its human voices. 16 Through every power 
to affirm and heal 17 The unknown world suggests the 
air and golden 18 Familiar flowers, and the brief glitter 
of waves, 19 And dreams, and leads me always to 
the real. 20 Even among these calendars of fire. 21 
Sings: There is much to fear, but not our power. 
22 The stars turn over us; let us not fear 
the many. 23 All mortal intricacies tremble upon this flower. 
24 Let us not fear the hidden. Or each other. 
25 We are alive in an hour whose burning face 
26 Looks into our death, death of our dear wish. 
27 And time that will be eating away our flesh 
28 Gives us this moment when blue settles on rose 
29 And evening suddenly seems limitless silver. 30 The cold 
wind streaming over the cold hill-grasses 31 Remembers and remembers. 
Mountains lift into night. 32 And I am remembering the 
face of peace. 33 I have seen a ship lying 
upon the water 34 Rise like a great bird, like 
a lifted promise.35 They called us to a change of 
heart 36 But it was not enough. 37 Not half 
enough, not half enough 38 For all their bargaining and 
their art. 39 After the change of heart there comes 
40 The savage waste of battlefield; 41 The flame of 
that wild battlefield 42 Rushes in fire through our rooms. 
43 The heart that comes to know its war 44 
When gambling powers try for place 45 Must live to 
wrestle for a place 46 For every burning human care: 
47 To know a war begins the day 48 Ideas 
of peace are bargained for, 49 Surrender and death are 
bargained for--- 50 Peace and belief must fight their way. 
51 Begin the day we change and so 52 Open 
the spirit to the world. 53 Wars of the spirit 
in the world 54 Makes us continually know 55 We 
fight continually to grow.56 Coming to Spain on the first 
day of the fighting, 57 Flame in the mountains, and 
the exotic soldiers, 58 I gave up ideas of strangeness, 
but now, keeping 59 All I profoundly hoped for, I 
saw fearing 60 Travellers and the unprepared and the fast-changing 
61 Foothills. The train stopped in a silver country. 62 
Coast-water lit the valleys of this country--- 63 All mysteries 
stood human in the fighting. 64 We came from far. 
We wondered, Were they changing, 65 Our mild companions, turning 
into soldiers? 66 But the cowards were persistent in their 
fearing, 67 Each of us narrowed to one wish he 
was keeping. 68 There was no change of heart here; 
we were keeping 69 Our deepest wish, meeting with hope 
this country. 70 The enemies among us went on fearing 
71 The frontier was too far behind. The fighting 72 
Was clear to us all at last. The belted soldiers 
73 Vanished into white hills that dark was changing. 74 
The train stood naked in flowery midnight changing 75 All 
complex marvellous hope to war, and keeping 76 Among us 
only the main wish, and the soldiers. 77 We loved 
each other, believed in the war; this country 78 Meant 
to us the arrival of the fighting 79 At home; 
we began to know what we were fearing. 80 As 
continents broke apart, we saw our fearing 81 Reflect our 
nations' fears; we acted as changing 82 Cities at home 
would act, with one wish, fighting 83 This threat or 
falling under it; we were keeping 84 The knowledge of 
fiery promises; this country 85 Struck at our lives, struck 
deeper than its soldiers. 86 Those who among us were 
sure became our soldiers. 87 The dreams of peace resolved 
our subtle fearing. 88 This was the first day of 
war in a strange country. 89 Free Catalonia offered that 
day our changing 90 Age's hope and resistance, held in 
its keeping 91 The war this age must win in 
love and fighting. 92 This first day of fighting showed 
us all men as soldiers. 93 It offered one wish 
for keeping. Hope. Deep fearing. 94 Our changing spirits awake 
in the soul's country.95 Much later, I lie in a 
white seaport night 96 Of gongs and mystery and bewildered 
mist 97 Giving me a strange harbor in these white 
98 Scenes, white rivers, my white dreams of peace. 99 
And a ship lifted up on a sign of freedom. 
100 Peace sharp and immediate as our winter stars. 101 
A blue sailor with a cargo of guitars. 102 I 
saw a white ship rise as peace was made 103 
In Spain, the first peace the world would not keep. 
104 The ship pulled away from the harbor where Columbus 
105 Standing on his black pillar sees new worlds; 106 
And suddenly all the people at all the rails 107 
Lifted their hands in a gesture of belief 108 That 
climbs among my dreams like a bird flying. 109 Until 
the world is lifted by one bird flying 110 An 
instant drawing to itself the world.111 Home thoughts from home; 
we read you every day, 112 Soldiers of distances. You 
wish most to be here. 113 In the strange lands 
of war, I woke and thought of home. 114 Remembering
