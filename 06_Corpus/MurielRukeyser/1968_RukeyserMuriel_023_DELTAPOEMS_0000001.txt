1 Among leaf-green 2 this morning, they 3 walk near 
water-blue, 4 near water-green 5 of the river-mouths 6 this 
boy this girl 7 they die with their heads near 
each other, 8 their young mouths 9 A sharp glint 
out among the sea 10 These are lives coming out 
of their craft 11 Men who resemble.... 12 Sound is 
bursting the sun 13 Two dead bodies against the leaves 
14 A young man and a girl 15 Their heads 
close together 16 No weapons, only grasses and waves 17 
Lives, grasses 18 Something is flying through the high air 
over the river-mouth 19 country, 20 Something higher than the 
look can go, 21 Higher than herons fly, 22 Higher 
than planes is it? 23 It is nothing now 24 
But now it is sound beyond bigness 25 Turns into 
the hugeness : death. A leaf shakes on the sky. 
26 Of the children in flames, of the grown man 
27 his face burned to the bones, of the full 
woman 28 her body stopped from the nipples down, nursing 
29 the live strong baby at her breast 30 I 
do not speak. 31 I am a woman 32 in 
a New York room 33 late in the twentieth century. 
34 I am crying. I will write no more.--- 35 
Young man and girl walking along the sea, 36 among 
the leaves. 37 Fresh hot day among the river-mouths, 38 
yellow-green leaves green rivers running to sea. 39 A young 
man and a girl 40 go walking in the delta 
country 41 The war has lasted their entire lifetime. 42 
They look at each other with their mouths. 43 They 
look at each other with their whole bodies. 44 A 
glint as of bright fire, metal over the sea-waters. 45 
A girl has died upon green leaves, 46 a young 
man has died against the sky. 47 A girl is 
walking printed against green leaves, 48 A young man walks 
printed upon the sky. 49 I remember you. We walked 
near the harbor. 50 You a young man believing in 
the future of summer, 51 in yellow, in green, in 
touch, in entering, 52 in the night-sky, in the gifts 
of this effort. 53 He believes in January, 54 he 
believes in the pulses beating along his body, 55 he 
believes in her young year. 56 I walk near the 
rivers. 57 They are walking again at the edge of 
waters. 58 They are killed again near the lives, near 
the waves. 59 They are walking, their heads are close 
together, 60 their mouths are close as they die. 61 
A girl and a young man walk near the water.
