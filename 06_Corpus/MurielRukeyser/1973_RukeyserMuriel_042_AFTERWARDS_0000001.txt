1 We are the antlers of that white animal 2 
That great white animal 3 Asleep under the sea 4 
He forgets and dreams so deep he does not 5 
Know his whiteness in the sea-black 6 Among the plants 
of night. 7 His antlers have legs and arms. Our 
heads 8 together being joined 9 Journey tonight, dreamed in 
his ocean. 10 Where we lie afterwards, smoke of our 
dreams 11 Goes coiling up, a plant in the dark 
room. 12 You were a young boy, you sang in 
the Polish woods 13 Limping away away. I in this 
city, held 14 In a dream of children. Some mythic 
animal 15 Rises now, flies up, white from the sea-floor. 
16 In all our death, the glow behind his eyes 
17 Speaks under all knowing : our lives burn.
