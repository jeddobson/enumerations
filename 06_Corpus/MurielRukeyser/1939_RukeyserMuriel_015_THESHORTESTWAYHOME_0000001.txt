1 There was no place on that plain for a 
city, 2 no city can break through the blank of 
the Black Prairie, 3 its stiff grass tufted grey and 
aluminum birds; 4 a province whose design holds fertile seasons, 
5 black earth, basis for growth; travellers whose approach 6 
bends daylight through ghosts, the reasonable dread, 7 frontier familiar 
form, through color without water. 8 There was no place 
on that prairie for relief, 9 until the Blue Marl 
Lands, relics of ancestors 10 passed us, belted by rocks, 
the tribal poles; 11 tourist, we hunt the past as 
the farmer hunts rain, 12 as the manic depressive in 
tired hunt for equilibrium 13 hunts sleep, swarm up the 
totems for a view, 14 see older beds outcropping, dipping 
seaward and blue. 15 There was no room on that 
road for a shadow. 16 Far off the sand-hills blew, 
domes over rock salt blowing 17 echo slant fields in 
the colors of winter still, 18 we pass white obelisks 
of pioneers, the square hero women 19 and also settlers 
who control the language, 20 riding the continent tilting seaward, 
seeing 21 the coastal plain stand faithful as a wall. 
22 Down-lying, the drowned valleys, the captured streams, the fall 
23 of barrier beach and hills embayed, the red, the 
orange, 24 the chocolate, the sulphur, the cuesta yellow. 25 
Profile of waves, a jaw of sand, surface of breakers, 
26 and there the end of the trip, and the 
five swimmers 27 finding, dive like spread hand into the 
lit water 28 seaming the ocean with silver. Tantrum of 
light on water. 29 The ladies watch whose jewels sparkle 
as they breathe, 30 the stander in wet boat, his 
net flinching with fish, 31 the city at the lagoon, 
surfboat and speedcar 32 see the whole country : Snow 
Mountain, under which leaps the rose 33 the tops of 
ranges where no lazy are, 34 through Black, Marl, Salt, 
to coast-land, vein to vein. 35 Down-lying, prophetic, the long 
veins of this land 36 passing into the sea without 
a change of slope. 37 Vein of this land feeding 
on rest again 38 eats central freshness, the white implacable 
root. 39 Each birth was earned with convulsions, each traveller's 
birth 40 spoke its word every time the tilt was 
changed. 41 But the ruined mills, but the ghost-towns, but 
the gaunt 42 adolescent 43 short-sleeved, torn-trouser, before the final 
beach! 44 Pathologies of lightnings turn to prose, 45 broken 
and jarring forms to peace. 46 A fugue of landscapes 
resolved, the hunt 47 levelled on equilibrium, that totemic head 
seeing 48 a natural sleep, a place for people and 
peace.
