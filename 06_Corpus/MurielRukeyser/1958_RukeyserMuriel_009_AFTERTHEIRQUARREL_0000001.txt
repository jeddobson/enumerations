1 After the quarrel in the house I walked the 
grasses of the field 2 Until the hissing of breakers 
and the hissing on the sand 3 Lowered, and I 
could see the seed heads and the sky. 4 A 
pod of the milkweed burst; it was speaking to me 
: 5 Never mind, never mind. All splits open. There 
is new inside, 6 We witness. Downwind, the softened asters 
let me see 7 A lengthened sky in its mixed 
oranges of sunset 8 Gone east and west, glazing the 
first bare branches. 9 The branches said: We know you. 
I remembered a tiger 10 The winter I was five 
not leaping in my dream but fusing 11 All my 
wishes to run, with his endless glowing look telling: 12 
I recognize you. Kill them if they deny; or wake 
them. Now 13 wake! 14 Autumn announcing birds, the flights 
calling from sunset. 15 One bird crying: I see you 
down there, bird! The quick furry 16 ground 17 Moves 
with me in small animals whispering: 18 You are like 
us, too. And the stars.---I my own evidence 19 That 
even the half-eaten and accursed can be a season. 20 
Search yourself, said all the field, understand growth. 21 When 
lack consents to leave its seed, waste opens, you will 
see 22 Even there, the husband of the spring, who 
knows his time.
