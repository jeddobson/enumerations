1 During the journey there come moments of waking 2 
When you will find, growing among your dream, 3 A 
sense of light. The setting constellation 4 Has gone far 
under while you fade in, fade out, 5 On the 
threshold of the recognizable. 6 Again, far off your road! 
But showers of fire 7 Burst in your body; now 
you can remember as 8 If for the first time 
the other waking that 9 Spoke one word to you. 
Daybreak. The 10 Actual day.
