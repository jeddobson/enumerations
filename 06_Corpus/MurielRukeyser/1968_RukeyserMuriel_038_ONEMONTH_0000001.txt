for Dorothy Lear 1 All this time 2 you were 
dead and I did not know 3 I was learning 
to speak 4 and speaking to you 5 and you 
were not there 6 I was seeing you 7 tall, 
walking the corridor 8 of that tall shining building 9 
I was learning to walk 10 and walking to you 
11 and it was not true 12 you were still 
living still lying still 13 it was not true 14 
that you were giving me a rose 15 telling me 
stories 16 pouring a wine-story, there were bubbles in it 
17 all this time 18 I was remembering untrue 19 
speaking untrue, seeing a lie. 20 It is true.
