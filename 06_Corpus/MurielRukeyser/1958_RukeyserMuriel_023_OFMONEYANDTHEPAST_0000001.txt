1 These coins and calendars stood for the moon, strong 
boys, 2 And the resinous storerooms of a house in 
silence. 3 Too many losses among the possible. 4 But 
only when you hear their fearful music: 5 Nothing at 
all and then the front door slamming, 6 The cave 
of sound at the station after all hope has gone, 
7 Fifteen wire hangers jangling in emptied closets. 8 When 
you discover the real, lying under, and still, 9 Among 
the silences green morning reopening. 10 Now your invisible path 
between the brambles opens 11 To the hill of oyster-shells 
under the hills of cloud 12 And the hard knuckles 
of a boy poverty-driven 13 And the moon rising in 
a smell of vanilla. 14 Voices of money, voices of 
your past, 15 The swinging music in these voices telling: 
16 No, no, you must go. Now. Go from this 
bay to where 17 You can bridge backward and forward 
and move toward form. 18 From here there is nothing. 
Nothing for you here. 19 Somewhere you may find something. 
But not here. 20 Do not look here, not now. 
Not anywhere here. 21 Nowhere, nowhere, nothing anywhere here. 22 
Beyond these coins and seasons, then look back. 23 When 
the black voices turn brilliant and call: Here!
