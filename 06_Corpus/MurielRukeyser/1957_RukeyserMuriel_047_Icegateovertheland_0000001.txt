1 Ice-gate over the land, a shock of closure. 2 
Across the country now, a many-worked crying 3 That masks 
a silence. The rising water and the entrapped air. 4 
These are ice-crises in the history of ice, 5 And 
nothing is known of the life of ice in earthquake. 
6 But all of this is about applause, 7 All 
of this is the fullness of values, 8 Commitment and 
refusal, the demand of the root 9 And the freezing 
of shallow streams. 10 When ice first forms 11 Snowfall 
and frozen rain may be its friends, 12 Deep roots 
recapture 13 Sleep of the heavy rain, the water rains, 
14 Much of the gathering is underground. 15 These forces 
are not delicate, they are subtle, 16 They are like 
quicksand, not a material, 17 But a condition. 18 They 
are not forces, they are men and women. 19 The 
crest gates waiting, 20 The wheeled gates sealed.
