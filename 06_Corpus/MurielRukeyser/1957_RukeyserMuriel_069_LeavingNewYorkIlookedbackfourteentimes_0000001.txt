1 Leaving New York, I looked back fourteen times: 2 
Once when the bridge was cloven, and the driver 3 
Chose smoothly. I saw the city emerge; but you 4 
Sleep somewhere, who in my waking never sleep. 5 The 
highway leaps. I look back many times. 6 Now again, 
I know the splitting everywhere: 7 Clouds, roads, words given 
me from you, this river 8 Dividing us, locking you 
back to the dreams of islands, 9 Locking me now 
to voyage and to air.
