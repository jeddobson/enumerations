1 There were three of them that night. 2 They 
wanted it to happen in the first woman's room. 3 
The man called her; the phone rang high. 4 Then 
she put fresh lipstick on. 5 Pretty soon he rang 
the bell. 6 She dreamed, she dreamed, she dreamed. 7 
She scarcely looked him in the face 8 But gently 
took him to his place. 9 And after that the 
bell, the bell. 10 They looked each other in the 
eyes, 11 A hot July it was that night, 12 
And he then slow took off his tie, 13 And 
she then slow took off her scarf, 14 The second 
one took off her scarf, 15 And he then slow 
his heavy shoe, 16 And she then slow took off 
her shoe, 17 The other one took off her shoe, 
18 He then took off his other shoe, 19 The 
second one, her other shoe, 20 A hot July it 
was that night. 21 And he then slow took off 
his belt, 22 And she then slow took off her 
belt, 23 The second one took off her belt .
