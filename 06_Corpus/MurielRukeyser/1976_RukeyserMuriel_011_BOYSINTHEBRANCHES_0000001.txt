1 Blue in the green trees, what are they climbing? 
2 And girls bringing water, what are they watering 3 
With their buckets spilling the wet dark on dry ground? 
4 And up the hill the concrete-mixers rolling 5 Owned 
by my father when I was the same youth 6 
As these who are my students, boys in the branches, 
7 Young women in the young trees. 8 The last 
few drops from the faucet, carried 9 To the tan 
crumbling earth. 10 The earth belongs to the authorities 11 
Of this college, and the authorities 12 Have turned the 
water off, have they? 13 Ask the owners of colleges, 
who is in the trees? 14 Ask the owners of 
concrete-mixers, who is holding 15 This acre of city land 
against the concrete? 16 We know where the water is. 
17 Blue green students in the branches 18 Defending the 
tree. The trees begin to shudder. 19 The concrete-mixers roll 
over exposed roots. 20 But isn't all this a romantic 
delusion? 21 You love the pouring of the city, don't 
you? 22 You need the buildings, don't you? 23 Sift 
the seeds. We need to sift the seeds. 24 We 
know where the water is. 25 They have turned the 
water off. 26 You don't want buildings not to be 
built, do you? 27 The blueprint lies on the flat-top 
desk. 28 The building now is two years built, 29 
Most of the boys went off to war, 30 I 
don't teach there any more. 31 Here we go, swimming 
to civilization, 32 We who stand and water and sift 
the seeds, 33 My students saying their word, it flies 
behind what I hear in 34 the air: 35 "Time 
is God's blood," Warren said. Avra wrote: 36 "Forgive me, 
Mother. I am alive."
