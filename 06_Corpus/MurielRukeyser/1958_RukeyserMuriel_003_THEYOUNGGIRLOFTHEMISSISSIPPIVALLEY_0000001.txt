1 Stallions go leap, and rimfire knows, 2 Where there 
was sleep the ware eye goes, 3 Out of the 
rotten climbs the rose. 4 I will remember how the 
music went 5 When he sang down my fears. 6 
A murder ballad blown by the moon away, 7 And 
all your dreaming could not make him stay. 8 wants 
the blue counties, the way to Africa. 9 Lean east 
lean west, the thousand ocean knows, 10 How soon do 
you come to the center again? 11 Nightmary, zip me 
up, the avenue 12 Is black, I'll start in the 
dark of the moon--- 13 Flat miles away my love 
who never knew 14 Wakes and leans on the windowsill, 
15 Wanting the sea-breasts of an unborn girl. 16 Hills 
climb, songs climb, and I will find him out, 17 
My child will leap like stallions from my mouth 18 
Before the traveler moon can light my heart, 19 There'll 
be a gun, and there'll be storms of roses, 20 
All Indiana crystal in my tears.
