1 When the exposed spirit, busy in daytime, 2 searches 
out night, only renewer. 3 That time plants turn to. 
The world's table. 4 When any single thing's condemned again. 
5 The changeable spirit finds itself out, 6 will not 
employ Saint Death, detective, 7 does its own hunting, runs 
at last to night. 8 Renewer, echo of judgment, morning-source, 
music. 9 Dark streets that light invents, one black tree 
standing, 10 struck by the street-light to raw electric green, 
11 allow one man at a time to walk past, 
plain. 12 Cities lose size. The earth is field 13 
and ranging these countries in sunset, we make quiet, 14 
living in springtime, wish for nothing, see 15 glass bough, 
invented green, flower-sharp day 16 crackle into orange and be 
subdued to night. 17 The mind, propelled by work, reaches 
its evening : 18 slick streets, dog-tired, point the way 
to sleep, 19 walls rise in color, now summer shapes 
the Square 20 (and pastel five o'clock chalked on the 
sky). 21 We drive out to the suburbs, bizarre lawns 
22 flicker a moment beside the speeding cars. 23 Speed 
haunts our ground, throws counties at us under 24 night, 
a black basin always spilling stars. 25 Waters trouble our 
quiet, vanishing down 26 reaches of hills whose image legend 
saves : 27 the foggy Venus hung above the flood 
28 rising, rising, from the sea, with her arms full 
of waves 29 as ours are full of flowers. 30 
Down polished airways a purple dove descending 31 sharp on 
the bodies of those so lately busy apart, 32 wingtip 
on breasttip, the deep body of feathers 33 in the 
breastgroove along the comforted heart. 34 The head inclined offers 
with love clear miles 35 of days simple in sun 
and action, bright 36 air poised about a face in 
ballet strictness 37 and pure pacific night. 38 But in 
our ears brute knocking at all doors, 39 factories bellow 
mutilation, and we live needy still 40 while strength and 
hours run 41 checkless downhill. 42 Flattered by grief, the 
changeable spirit 43 puts on importance. Goes into the street, 
44 adventures everywhere but places fear 45 is absent. Everywhere 
the face's look 46 is absent, the heart is flat, 
47 the avenues haunted by a head whose eye 48 
runs tears incessantly, the other eye 49 narrow in smiling. 
Everywhere, words fail, 50 men sunk to dust, houses condemned, 
walls ruined, 51 and dust is never an anachronism. 52 
Everywhere the eye runs tears. And here 53 the hand, 
propelled somehow, marches the room 54 pulling dark windowshades down 
around the gaze. 55 And now, stately, jotting on lipstick, 
she 56 prepares to sexualize her thistle thought. 57 Loosens 
her earrings, smiling. Drives 58 herself far into night. Smiles, 
fornicating. Drives 59 herself deep into sleep. Sees children sleep.1
