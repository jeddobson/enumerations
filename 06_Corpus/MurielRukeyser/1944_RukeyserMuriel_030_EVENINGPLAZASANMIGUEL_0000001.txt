1 No one will ever understand that evening 2 Who 
has not lain the night with a changeable lover, 3 
Changeable as that last evening. 4 No one who has 
not ever seen that color 5 Change and travel the 
hills, the irrelevant bells 6 Ringing the changes, 7 And 
seen the green enter the evening sky, 8 Reluctant yellow 
come and the cathedral 9 Unfold in rose--- 10 And 
stood under that rose of stone, remembering rose 11 Spattered 
in feasts of rockets, interrupted 12 By the black downdrawn 
line 13 Of the down-turning wheel of carnival---will ever know 
14 The evening color filtered through cinnamon 15 And how 
the birds came down 16 Through the bars of yellow 
and the bars of green 17 Into the brandy dusk 
and the leaves of night, 18 A touch, a shadow 
of touch, when breasts 19 Lift their little branches, and 
showers and flares of fire 20 Rise in the blood, 
in spite of the word of war, 21 In spite 
of evening coming down like a lover, 22 Like the 
birds falling among the trees, like music 23 As the 
trees close, and the cathedral closes. 24 No one will 
know who in a stranger land 25 Has never stood 
while night came down 26 In shadows of roses, a 
cloud of tree-drawn birds, 27 And said, "I must go 
home."
