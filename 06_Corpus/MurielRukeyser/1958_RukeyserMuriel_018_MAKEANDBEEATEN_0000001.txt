1 Make and be eaten, the poet says, 2 Lie 
in the arms of nightlong fire, 3 To celebrate the 
waking, wake. 4 Burn in the daylong light; and praise 
5 Even the mother unappeased, 6 Even the fathers of 
desire. 7 Blind go the days, but joy will see 
8 Agreements of music; they will wind 9 The shaking 
of your dance; no more 10 Will the ambiguous arm-waves 
spell 11 Confusion of the blessing given. 12 Only and 
finally declare 13 Among the purest shapes of grace 14 
The waking of the face of fire, 15 The body 
of waking and the skill 16 To make your body 
such a shape 17 That all the eyes of hope 
shall stare. 18 That all the cries of fear shall 
know, 19 Staring in their bird-pierced song; 20 Lines of 
such penetration make 21 That shall bind our loves at 
last. 22 Then from the mountains of the lost, 23 
All the fantasies shall wake, 24 Strong and real and 
speaking turn 25 Wherever flickers your unreal. 26 And my 
strong ghosts shall fade and pass 27 My love start 
fiery as grass 28 Wherever burn my fantasies, 29 Wherever 
burn my fantasies.
