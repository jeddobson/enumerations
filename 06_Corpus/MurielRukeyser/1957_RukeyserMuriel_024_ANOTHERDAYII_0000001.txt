1 PAUL: And then the cow did write. 2 His 
mother said sleep, sleep, 3 The other cows are outside, 
4 You have been bad, 5 More than the black 
cow, 6 More than the white; 7 Go to sleep. 
8 You are a baby cow. 9 Your father is 
in the creek. 10 I had no home and I 
cried 11 Master, master! 12 I want some water or 
I will be sad.
