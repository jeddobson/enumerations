1 Do you know the name of the average animal? 
2 Not the dog, 3 Nor the green-beaded frog, 4 
Nor the white ocean monster lying flat--- 5 Lower than 
that. 6 The curling one who comes out in the 
storm--- 7 The middle one's the worm. 8 Lift up 
your face, my love, lift up your mouth, 9 Kiss 
me and come to bed 10 And do not bow 
your head 11 Longer on what is bad or what 
is good--- 12 The dead are terribly misunderstood, 13 And 
sin and godhead are in the worm's blind eye, 14 
We'll come to averages by and by.
