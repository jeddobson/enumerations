1 What is the skill of this waking? Heard the 
singing 2 of that man rambling up Frederick Street in 
music 3 and his repeated ecstasy, in a long shaken 
line. 4 After many and many a February storm, cyclamen 
5 and many a curtain of rain, the tearing of 
all curtains 6 and, as you said, making love and 
facing the police 7 in one afternoon. A few bright 
colors in permanent ink: 8 black sea, light like streetlight 
green, blue sees in you 9 the sun and the 
moon that stand as your guardians. 10 And the young 
bearded rebels and students tearing it all away, 11 all 
of it, down to the truth that barefaced naked act 
of 12 light, streamings of the courage of the sources, 
13 the sun and the moon that stand at your 
ears.
