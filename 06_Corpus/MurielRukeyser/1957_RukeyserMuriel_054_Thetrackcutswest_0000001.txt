1 The track cuts west. Slant roof, sun-catcher, 2 Outhouse, 
and barbed wire, the scrub growing up hill, 3 And 
a man in overalls walking the eleventh furrow. 4 The 
hard eyes of bigots. The hard eyes of the poor. 
5 Full moon at Skelly Stadium, the crowd 6 Roaring 
through Tulsa, the screams of wild turkeys, 7 The underground 
black sounds of strength, Negroes and oil, 8 In a 
growing city. After the tents and clapboards, 9 The spinning 
of chance, the spinning dance of derricks 10 On the 
horizon through the pecan grove, 11 Across the broomcorn, across 
the tumbleweed, 12 Past the false-fronted clapboard, the pipeline, and 
this crowd, 13 Deep-throated, hard-riding, impoverished as by war, 14 
Eaten away by dust the eroder, water, 15 Poverty the 
eroder and the eroder oil. 16 Waiting for fullness under 
the open moon. 17 I saw the footpath beside the 
telegraph poles 18 Waver among the knotted weeds, 19 Straighten. 
A child here 20 In faded clothes among the faded 
words: 21 The sheetflood washed me clean. 22 My hilltop 
when I ran alone 23 Is put to pasture, ridge 
the contour round, 24 How shall I be, how shall 
I be found? 25 Furrows hold ice, furrows hold snow, 
26 Plow the slope that I name home. 27 Dust 
my mother overturned, 28 Sand and dust and wind have 
come, 29 To burn my days, until I go 30 
To find the garden of the wind, 31 The pleasant 
garden of the world, 32 Where the sheetflood lost its 
force 33 Wrapped all its water in a bud, 34 
Where bud and seed and fledgling bird, 35 Where the 
child will tell his word, 36 Where all the streams 
are from.
