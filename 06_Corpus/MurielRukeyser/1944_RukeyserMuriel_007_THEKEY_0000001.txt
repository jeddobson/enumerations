1 I hold a key in my hand 2 And 
it is cold, cold; 3 The sign of a lost 
house 4 That framed a symbolic face. 5 Its windows 
now are black, 6 Its walls are blank remorse, 7 
Here is a brass key 8 Freezing to the touch. 
9 Of that house I say here 10 Goodness came 
through its door, 11 There every name was known, 12 
And of all its faces 13 Unaligned beauty gives 14 
Me one forever 15 That made itself most dear 16 
By killing the cruelest bond: 17 Father murder and mother 
fear. 18 What perception in that face 19 Nothing but 
loneliness 20 Can ever again retrace--- 21 Conflict and isolation, 
22 A man among copper rocks, 23 Human among inhuman 
24 Formal immune and cold, 25 Or a wonderful young 
woman 26 In the world of the old. 27 I 
walk the world with these: 28 A wish for quick 
speech 29 Of heathen storm-beaten poems 30 In pure-lined English 
sound, 31 A key in my hand that freezes 32 
Like memories of faces 33 Whose intellectual color 34 Relieves 
their cruelty, 35 Until the wishes be found 36 And 
the symbols of worship speak, 37 And all may in 
peace, in peace, 38 Guiltless turn to that mouth.
