for Nancy Marshall 1 You are like me born at 
the end of the year; 2 When in our city 
day closes blueness comes 3 We see a beginning in 
the ritual end. 4 Never mind: I know it is 
never what it seems, 5 That ending: for we are 
born, we are born there, 6 There is an entrance 
we may always find. 7 They reckon by the wheel 
of the year. Our birth's before. 8 From the dark 
birthday to the young year's first stay 9 We are 
the ones who wait and look for ways: 10 Ways 
of beginning, ways to be born, ways for 11 Solvings, 
turnings, wakings; we are always 12 A little younger than 
they think we are.
