1 A red bridge fastening this city to the forest, 
2 Telling relationship in a stroke of steel; 3 Cloud-hung 
among the mist it speaks the real, 4 In the 
morning of need asserts the purest 5 Of our connections 
: for the opposites 6 To call direct, to be 
the word that goes, 7 Glowing from fires of thought 
to thought's dense snows, 8 Growing among the treason and 
the threats. 9 Between the summer strung and the young 
city, 10 Linking the stonefall to the treefall slope, 11 
Beyond the old namings of body and mind 12 A 
red bridge building a new-made identity: 13 Communion of love 
opened to cross and find 14 Self the enemy, this 
moment and our hope.
