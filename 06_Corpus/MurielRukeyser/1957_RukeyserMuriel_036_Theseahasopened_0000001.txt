1 The sea has opened, the limit of his dream 
2 Has split; now lights announce him to the day. 
3 He is born; and asleep, awake, and soon the 
warm 4 Taste of the second world calls him to 
understand 5 Power drawn on the tides of sweetness in. 
6 His strength allowing change, letting him choose and grow 
7 Again, and the curve of the world is breast, 
the breathing land 8 With his own breathing tells of 
peace and form. 9 Not now, but much later, does 
the world fall away. 10 This is myself, says the 
child. My self, we all did say. 11 There is 
my mother, whose pleasure, whose deep need 12 It was 
to feed me singing, or recoil. 13 And then the 
fable, the terrible forgetting. 14 A cold distortion twisting past 
the leaves. 15 Was there a Garden? Was there a 
Tree of Sin? 16 What was my exile but from 
memory? 17 Refusal, flowering, was the only tree. 18 It 
grew until the truth was almost lost. 19 Cast, the 
obliterate spirit sang its loss. 20 Dream and the sea 
open. 21 All things find their change. 22 The child 
remembers : the child is the tree; 23 The tides, 
the leaves, the city, the true relation. 24 The world 
was the mother, the world; it was always the world 
25 Pure, fierce, all moving and all reconciled.
