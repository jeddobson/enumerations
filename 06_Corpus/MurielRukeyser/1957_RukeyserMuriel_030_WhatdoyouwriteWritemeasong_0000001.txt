1 PAUL: What do you write? 2 Write me a 
song. 3 What about? The fish I do not know. 
4 ---The man had little streams. 5 And a bright 
pain. 6 It was bright when he pushed 7 With 
a noise and a bar. 8 A tooth. With a 
hole. 9 There can be holes in the ground, 10 
Can there be holes 11 In the white sky? 12 
The sky is a tree. It spreads. 13 Does it 
hurt the ground to have holes? 14 Why, the sky 
was white .
