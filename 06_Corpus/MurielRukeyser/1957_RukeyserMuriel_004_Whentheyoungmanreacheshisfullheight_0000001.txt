1 When the young man reaches his full height, sharpened 
on the 2 arguments of his strong house, mixed in 
the opposites of all he 3 knows, tall in the 
heat, and waiting to speak. 4 Has moved finally to 
the front of the stage, has felt for the first 
5 time all the eyes. 6 They are waiting for 
him to declare his entire form. Faces 7 composed in 
a habit of boredom. 8 They come from these fields, 
split by these towns run central 9 through them as 
they sleep; they walked these streets of smoke, 10 they 
drove these heavy horses to the barn, slept with the 
same 11 women, were lost too in these swamps of 
black and ancient 12 green. 13 Deep in these graveyard 
nights found girls throwing defies of 14 their bodies to 
death on the grave-grass and on the porches and 15 
behind the brickyards and under the knotted trees. 16 Judges 
of all hope work out the same whisky, the same 
riverbanks 17 and barrooms, bury in themselves the same bodies 
and the 18 same images, are burned in the memory 
of the color of fire 19 When they hear the 
doors strike shut behind them, the gongs of 20 time 
like closed-down metal mills, 21 And they know now they 
are called to breathe in air of the same 22 
belief, the warm deep native earth and air, already surrendered 
23 and done to death, 24 To cut their time 
with an edge of new-cut finding. 25 The young man 
takes his wavering breath. He is naming himself 26 in 
the tribe ceremony. 27 Prepared for speech among many wakings 
in the lights of his 28 lifetime, he speaks to 
these faces. 29 Under and before him, faces of judges, 
30 Discovering provocation. 31 His legs feel very long to 
him and the ideas feel holy. 32 It comes to 
him now that the courts are sworn to these old 
ideas, 33 green stalks of being, that the courts are 
all of choice. 34 The choice of growth is of 
the closing and opening of doors. 35 Doors of our 
rock, yes, clanging of mountains, 36 Through which our grandfathers 
drove their seed. Mountains, 37 and seas of exile and 
of choice, 38 By whose unforeseen stars we made landfall, 
our coast being 39 always choice 40 In another freedom. 
Though we may land here there is no other 41 
landing, to choose our meaning we must make it new. 
42 He knows the animals of boyhood and the west. 
43 Freedom to him is a constant and a bond. 
44 Close to our wildness, be fierce and be safe, 
45 Be fast and be feeding, 46 Be strong according 
to our own kind.
