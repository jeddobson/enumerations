1 It was much later in his life he rose 
2 in the professors' room, the frail bones rising 3 
among that fume of mathematical meaning, 4 symbols, the language 
of symbols, literature ... threw 5 air, simple life, in 
the dead lungs of their meeting, 6 said, "Mathematics is 
a language." 7 Withdrew. Into a silent world beyond New 
Haven, 8 the street-fights gone, the long youth of undergraduate 
9 riots down Church Street, initiation violence, 10 secret societies 
gone : a broken-glass isolation, 11 bottles smashed flat, windows 
out, street-fronts broken : 12 to quiet, 13 the little 
portico, wrought-iron and shutters' house. 14 A usable town, a 
usable tradition. 15 In war or politics. 16 Not science. 
17 Withdrew. 18 Civil War generates, but 19 Not here. 
Tutors Latin after his doctorate 20 when all of Yale 
is disappearing south. 21 There is no disorganization, for there 
is no passion. 22 Condense, he is thinking. Concentrate, restrict. 
23 This is the state permits the whole to stand, 
24 the whole which is simpler than any of its 
parts. 25 And the mortars fired, the tent-lines, lines of 
trains, 26 earthworks, breastworks of war, field-hospitals, 27 Whitman forever 
saying, "Identify." 28 Gibbs saying 29 "I wish to know 
systems." 30 To be in this work. Prepare an apocryphal 
31 cool life in which nothing is not discovery 32 
and all is given, levelly, after clearest 33 most disciplined 
research. 34 The German years 35 of voyage, calmer than 
Kant in Koenigsberg, to states 36 where laws are passed 
and truth's a daylight gift. 37 Return to a house 
inheriting Julia's keys, 38 sister receiving all the gifts of 
the world, 39 white papers on your desk. 40 Spiritual 
gift 41 she never took. 42 Books of discovery, 43 
haunted by steam, ghost of the disembodied engine, 44 industrialists 
in their imperious designs 45 made flower an age to 
be driven far by this 46 serene impartial acumen. 47 
Years of driving 48 his sister's coach in the city, 
knowing the 49 rose of direction loosing its petals down 
50 atoms and galaxies. Diffusion's absolute. 51 Phases of matter! 
The shouldering horses pass 52 turnings (snow, water, steam) echoing 
plotted curves, 53 statues of diagrams, the forms of schemes 
54 to stand white on a table, real as phase, 
55 or as the mountainous summer curves when he 56 
under New Hampshire lay while shouldering night 57 came down 
upon him then with all its stars. 58 Gearing that 
power-spire to the wide air. 59 Exacting symbols of rediscovered 
worlds. 60 Through evening New Haven drove. The yellow window 
61 of Sloane Lab all night shone. 62 Shining an 
image whole, as a streak of brightness 63 bland on 
the quartz, light-blade on Iceland spar 64 doubled! and the 
refraction carrying fresh clews. 65 Withdrew. 66 It will be 
an age of experiment, 67 or mysticism, anyway vastest assumption. 
68 He makes no experiments. Impregnable retires. 69 Anyone having 
these desires will make these researches. 70 Laws are the 
gifts of their systems, and the man 71 in constant 
tension of experience drives 72 moments of coexistence into light. 
73 It is the constitution of matter I must touch. 
74 Deduction from deduction : entropy, 75 heat flowing down 
a gradient of nature, 76 perpetual glacier driving down the 
side 77 of the known world in an equilibrium tending 
78 to uniformity, the single dream. 79 He binds 80 
himself to know the public life of systems. 81 Look 
through the wounds of law 82 at the composite face 
of the world. 83 If Scott had known, 84 he 
would not die at the Pole, he would have been 
85 saved, and again saved---here, gifts from overseas, 86 and 
grapes in January past Faustus' grasp. 87 Austerity, continence, veracity, 
the full truth flowing 88 not out from the beginning 
and the base, 89 but from accords of components whose 
end is truth. 90 Thought resting on these laws enough 
becomes 91 an image of the world, restraint among 92 
breaks manacles, breaks the known life before 93 Gibbs' pale 
and steady eyes. 94 He knew the composite 95 many-dimensioned 
spirit, the phases of its face, 96 found the tremendous 
level of the world, 97 Energy : Constant, but entropy, 
the spending, 98 tends toward a maximum---a "mixed-up-ness," 99 and 
in this end of levels to which we drive 100 
in isolation, to which all systems tend, 101 Withdraw, he 
said clearly. 102 The soul says to the self : 
I will withdraw, 103 the self saying to the soul 
: I will withdraw, 104 and soon they are asleep 
together 105 spiralling through one dream 106 Withdrew, but in 
107 his eager imperfect timidities, rose and dared 108 sever 
waterspouts, bring the great changing world 109 time makes more 
random, into its unity.
