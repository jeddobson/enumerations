blonde, "oh no," as the mist arose. 359 Organization of 
simple banking system for passengers, 360 but the closed bar, 
the empty shops, the lack of cigarettes. 361 Dreams of 
distress: land passed in the night, with no one 362 
looking, 363 the rising mist, the subterfuge, disaster. 364 Log's 
entry: "Engines faltering, charts useless, meat maggotty, 365 passengers grown 
flabby with lack of confidence, 366 great trust in me 
while I believed in my orders. 367 But lately, doubts 
batter me. I do not confess. 368 The sea is 
369 full of teeth, full of music, and there is 
war at home." 370 His mirror said, Order's tarnished, you 
drift insane. 371 Drift through continual waste of waters, under 
high heated 372 clouds, 373 closing to storm-threat, guarding the 
ship, closing to fog, 374 and the passengers stared through 
shadow imagining 375 twirling cool springs, low-banked familiar flowers. 376 
"Now," wrote the captain, "boats of madness ferry across the 
377 brain, 378 the blizzard sky's covered by fog and 
lost, 379 we'll sail by dead reckoning while the sun 
is covered; 380 saviors may rise which only can be 
seen 381 standing in mirrors." 382 He looked at the 
tarnished heirloom giving him back his face, 383 no word, 
no savior; raw forehead, open book. 384 On deck they 
lay obscured, bodily blanketed, 385 the faceless travellers, streaming fog 
bannering 386 between them let them forget the dangling lifeboat 
hooks, 387 the prison days, the reach of sea, the 
death 388 around them, mutinies, wars, suicides, angers, 389 the 
ineffective racid idle engines. 390 The captain saw the fog 
taint brightening to ochre, 391 "Sulphur!" he cried, "that's hell, 
that's yellow, the color of 392 madness, 393 we'll travel 
back to blue . . ." 394 tearing at his 
mirror, smashing it, smashing the radio, 395 smashing the fog 
396 until his arms were tied. 397 And deep into 
the galleries of fog, riding in silence, ship 398 drifted 
dead. The cloud came wave on wave, 399 the blond 
woman sang to the sleeping passengers, captain 400 shrieked from 
his straitjacket: Make her go, her hair is yellow fog. 
401 Land, land, she sang, let them all attempt land. 
402 Land, she sang, doubtful or dangerous. Barriers came 403 
Disaster of music in the yellow fog, 404 and she 
sang land 405 Drifting. Disaster. Drifted the world away 406 
saner than angels, promise of safety, harbor.
