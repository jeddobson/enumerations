for Toni 1 Lattice of his back grows, the dolphin-arching, 
till 2 That ripple, that stress, dance on a board 
on a ball, 3 Bracing are planted among the unbalanced 
seas 4 Rooted in whirlwind, flanks of a man whose 
torse 5 Unknots becoming the face of all control 6 
Trembling past his tornadoes, rouse of storm 7 Walking upon 
one point of make and build. 8 Black copper acrobat 
from Ecuador. 9 Is followed by the blonde and summer 
one 10 Fallen in whiteness upon her smooth trapeze, 11 
Swung to no heavier and softer force 12 Than Monet's 
waterlilies in his light suspended 13 Or floating in our 
joy, or floating in circus air, 14 The calm eye 
at the core of the hurricane.
