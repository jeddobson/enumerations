if I could rest my life, 108 my forehead on 
those knees and the arriving shadows 109 in rising quiet 
as the long night arrives. 110 Terror, war, terror, black 
blood and wasted love, 111 The most terrible country, in 
the heads of men. 112 This is the war imagination 
made; 113 it must be strong enough to make a 
peace. 114 My peace is strong enough if it will 
come 115 flowing, the color of eyes. When the world 
burns away 116 nothing is left can ever be betrayed. 
117 All broken promises, adulterate release--- 118 cast in the 
river Death, charred surface of waste, 119 a downward soulset, 
never the old heaven 120 held for a moment as 
breath held underwater; 121 but we must rise into a 
breathing world. 122 And this dark bellowing century, on its 
knees---? 123 If all this must go down, it must. 
124 And all this brilliance go to dust? 125 Only 
the meanings can remain alive. 126 When the cemeteries are 
military objectives 127 and love's a downward drawing at the 
heart 128 and every letter bears the stamp of death. 
129 There is no solution. There is no happiness. 130 
Only the range must be taken, a way be found 
to use 131 the inmost frenzy and the outer doom. 
132 They are here, they run their riot in the 
clouds, 133 fly in our blood and over all our 
mountains, 134 corrupt all waters, poison the pride of theme. 
135 Years of judgment! Century screaming for 136 the flowing, 
the life, the intellectual leap 137 of waters over a 
world grown old and wild, 138 a broken crying for 
seasonal change until 139 O God my love in time 
the waste become 140 the sure magnificent music of the 
defeated heart. Summer 1940
