1 The secret child walks down the street 2 of 
the year's winter black and white, 3 while evening flames, 
blue-green and high--- 4 the smooth face turns in the 
snow-smooth street 5 to lights, star-bubbles, the dark tree, 6 
the giant star in the sacred sky. 7 Children behind 
their windows sing 8 a cradle, a birth, the pilgrim 
kings, 9 praising the still and wild. 10 They praise 
the face, the quickening, 11 the various joy, the wound! 
They sing 12 a new prophetic child. 13 Out of 
the street, out of the spire, 14 a slow voice, 
radio or king, 15 begins above the mystery. 16 Tells 
pain and sweetness, pain and fire. 17 The bells begin 
to cast their rings 18 of celebration down the sky. 
19 The secret child walks down the street 20 of 
needle-dark December smells. 21 She walks with wonder everywhere. 22 
Who is that Child? Where is that sweet 23 face 
of the songs and silver bells, 24 the broad red 
saint, the angelhair? 25 The voice tells ragged ships that 
sailed 26 to find that birth and piercèd hand, 27 
a little child among the Jews. 28 "But I," she 
says, "I am a child 29 of Jews---" Says, "This 
is Christianland 30 and things are otherwise. 31 "People, beasts, 
and a winter rose, 32 procession and thorn, the suffering 
33 that had to be, the needed loss 34 led 
to this flame among the snows. 35 Three agents brought 
about this thing: 36 the Father, the Jews, the blesséd 
cross. 37 "And one of these is ours and overhead; 
38 and one is God; and one is still outside." 
39 Sure of the birth then, the people all went 
to sleep. 40 But the child was awake, and grieved 
for the time ahead, 41 awake all night, watching the 
land and the sky. 42 Did the child weep? No 
the child did not weep.
