1 The tree of rivers seen and forgotten, 2 With 
all its lightnings laid over it, the white law. 3 
Strokes of the spirit on the flowing spirit 4 Seen, 
forgotten, and seen, until the source. 5 But the source, 
simple and various 6 As possibility, the nest of light, 
7 Is open; what do you forget who have forgotten? 
8 At home or hunting, forgetting takes your throat. 9 
This dream of rivers responding, as many lives respond: 10 
The cant of a dam and the running of fresh 
waters 11 Allow discovery deep in the city of your 
days 12 Starting up, before your faces born, 13 Born 
and reborn of your perceive, 14 Of your smile that 
you recognize 15 The meanings as they move.
