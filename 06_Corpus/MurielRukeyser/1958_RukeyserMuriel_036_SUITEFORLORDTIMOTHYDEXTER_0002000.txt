me mad. 156 They slip my meaning--- 157 When I 
mock at them, I 158 always make money--- 159 How 
can this go on? 160 Harum scarum, merchant marum, 161 
My house is built, and my wall of pillars, 162 
A noted house to the Isles of Shoals. 163 My 
kings, my presidents, stand round: 164 I speak in images 
so they may know 165 My gold spread-eagle on the 
cupalow. 166 Dr. Franklin, Mr. Hamilton, John Hancock, Rufus King, 
167 John Jay, two grenadiers. 8 168 Four lions, and 
here the roof runs so, 169 That a lamb can 
lie down with one of the 170 lions, 171 And 
an eagle on the cupalow. 172 One unicorn, one dog, 
one horse, 173 And in the Garden Adam and Eve--- 
174 I will if I please have Adam and Eve. 
175 If no man murders me summer or snow 176 
I'll carry this to its fair concluding 177 With an 
eagle on the cupalow. 178 Three of the apostles, viz. 
179 St. Paul St. Peter and St. John. 180 Venus, 
Hiram, and Solomon--- 9 181 The President's platform and columns 
182 grow--- 183 I meant marble, but wood it is, 
184 And an eagle on the cupalow. 185 George Third, 
L'Ouverture, 186 Lord Nelson Baron of the Nile. 187 Constantinople's 
Grand Signior, 188 All heroes, each one in his style--- 
189 The Chief Cornplanter with his bow, 190 His moccasins, 
arrows, and tomahawk, 191 And an eagle on the cupalow. 
192 Black rum and silver gin, 193 Drink for this 
company. 194 For the resident poet, Jonathan Plummer, 195 With 
a wheelbarrow full of broadsides and haddock--- 196 Malaga wine 
for Madam Hooper, 197 Timothy Dexter's fortune-teller; 198 And for 
brandy-breasted Lucy, Lucy Lancaster, 199 Daughter of princes in Africa, 
200 Feathers and majesty---what for her? 201 Black rum and 
silver gin 202 And a coach with cream-color horses. 203 
Filisy, folosy, silver gin, 204 Stingalum, stangalum, wine for day, 
205 Ram pan, muski dan, 206 And wine for night 
on the sound blind sea. 207 Stingalum, stangalum, buck. 208 
Rum, whalerbone, whackerbone, 209 Waterfront, turnpike, Merrimack bridge, 210 Sea-berry, 
sea-gold, pine-forest edge; 211 Wire, briar, limber lock, 212 Timothy's 
a red red rock 213 Surrounded by waves of whisky 
and wine, 214 Loving waves called Jonathan, 215 Lucy Lancaster, 
Madam Hooper, 216 And a coach with cream-color horses.146 How 
can I speak to them today? What can I know, 
147 What can I show so that we see ourselves? 
148 Voices of stinted singing in the towns, 149 Voices 
of wildness and fear of wilderness. 150 The rhythm, the 
root. Gathering in 151 Sources of music and the wild 
sea-rose. 152 Sea-music and the sea building its waters, 153 
The weathervane beast. My song. 154 Whenever I say what 
I mean 155 They mock and call me mad. 156 
They slip my meaning--- 157 When I mock at them, 
I 158 always make money--- 159 How can this go 
on? 160 Harum scarum, merchant marum, 161 My house is

I mean here; in a book; 218 I wants to 
make 219 My Enemies grin 220 Like a cat over 
221 A hot puddin. 222 If you can bear the 
truth 10 223 Then I will tell the truth: 224 
Man's the best animal, 225 And the worst--- 226 All 
men, I say, are more or 227 Less the Devil's. 
228 Odds make the difference 229 And there's a sight 
of odds. 230 Some half, some quarters. 231 Odds make 
the difference. 232 I see in all places God, the 
God 233 Of nature in all things. 234 We live 
and move in God, 235 We live in God. 236 
When great powers ruled, 237 I was born. 11 238
