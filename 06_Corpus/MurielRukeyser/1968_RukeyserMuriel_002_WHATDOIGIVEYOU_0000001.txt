1 What do I give you? This memory 2 I 
cannot give you. Force of a memory 3 I cannot 
give you : it rings my nerves among. 4 None 
of these songs 5 Are made in their images. 6 
Seeds of all memory 7 Given me give I you 
8 My own self. Voice of my days. 9 Blessing; 
the seed and pain, 10 Green of the praise of 
growth. 11 The sacred body of thirst.
