1 Morning cried by the bed : 2 at Seven 
I understood--- 3 by Eight, I was very God, 4 
happiness in my head. 5 At Nine, I went to 
work, 6 and all the machines spoke : 7 Quiet 
there! Don't talk, 8 make, break and make! 9 At 
Ten, I opened my book 10 and all that hour 
I read 11 'The tallest men are dead, 12 their 
graveyard's in your look....' 13 I rose, angered, through sky 
14 in a plane of glass, 15 dreaming speed, I 
pass 16 very bright, very high. 17 As it went 
up toward Noon 18 I heard the sun scream : 
19 fly, suck your yellow dream, 20 we'll end it 
soon. 21 I fell all through One, 22 howling and 
threatening, 23 until at Two I sing 24 of a 
far reunion : 25 On Three the masses spread, 26 
a fist opening bare, 27 a great hand in the 
square 28 to vindicate the dead. 29 By Four the 
men had gone, 30 the land was wet with rain 
31 and a fountain stood up plain 32 on every 
lawn. 33 The clock picked at Five, 34 those jets 
turned silver then 35 with the lovely words of men 
36 who wrote and remained alive, 37 prophesying the night 
38 of Six, and the dawn behind; 39 but, creeping 
down the wind, 40 Seven snatched all the light. 41 
Now am I left alone 42 waiting for day : 
43 sometimes I turn away, 44 sometimes I sleep like 
stone. 45 Midnight is on my heels, 46 death bites 
about my legs. 47 While all my courage sags 48 
the endless night wheels, 49 danger yells, and with 50 
this blackness comes 51 back confidence, and blooms 52 in 
song and act and myth. 53 Call off your black 
dog, death, 54 it cannot bark me down : 55 
I'll travel past these wounds 56 and speak another breath!
