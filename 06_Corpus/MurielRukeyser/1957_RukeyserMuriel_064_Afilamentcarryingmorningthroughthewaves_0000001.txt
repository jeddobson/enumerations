1 A filament carrying morning through the waves, 2 A 
nerve singing branches. 3 Orbits of pear blossom 4 Recurring 
while the wars declared themselves; 5 On the red rails, 
the train hurling his words 6 Down all the arteries 
of tears. 7 Endure, grandmother of all music, 8 Crystal 
in Asia, indelible pinnacles 9 Color of going to sleep 
10 Above the breastÃ«s gold. 11 Endure, sing : deep 
night in Abyssinia 12 Waits for a messenger, heat 13 
Of that ancient waiting 14 Rising from tongues of lions. 
15 The jagged time, the jagged time of clues, 16 
All broken inheritances riding home 17 Past columns and ruins, 
down the edge-lit clouds 18 Reaching back to the well 
at home, a twilight girl 19 Wherefrom new breasts, new 
sources, feed the dawn. 20 Singing develop 21 The sapphire 
climbing song 22 Flaring, a woman's eternal jugular cry. 23 
An Ethiopian Jew praising the world, 24 The flying psalm 
inviting creation come. 25 Osiris in his veins praising the 
world away. 26 Wine that is poetry---inclare! inclare! 27 The 
conqueror of all attractive dragons 28 Is in that vice 
and white and steam. 29 He waited. He saw the 
water. 30 But the recurrent branch 31 Flew backward on 
the track in early day, 32 Warning him against compliance, 
breaking 33 In blossom said, Willkie! 34 You must defy 
them or be lost! 35 The foam spinning on water 
straight beneath 36 Will tell another myth, and spin and 
drown. 37 Far down under the trestle invisible. 38 His 
sense of the real leaves him. Dizzy and blind. 39 
Will go to Washington.
