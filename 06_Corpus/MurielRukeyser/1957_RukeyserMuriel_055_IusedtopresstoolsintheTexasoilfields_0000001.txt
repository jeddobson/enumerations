1 I used to press tools in the Texas oil 
fields. 2 We produce 60% of the oil of the 
world. 3 (Let the streetlamps burn all night!) 4 Amarillo 
in the morning heat 5 Away from the boom-town, infancy, 
6 Used to be made of buffalo-hide, 7 Ain't made 
of buffalo-hide no more. 8 Little boys of the Panhandle 
9 Used to pitch pennies at the yellow houses 10 
Used to gather buffalo-bones. 11 Ship away the buffalo-bones. 12 
Barbed wire was invented here : 13 Sing me a 
boardwalk in an old ghost town, 14 Gun play near 
the courthouse : Now vote me in, 15 I'll give 
a lot each for every vote, 16 Turn the LX 
into Amarillo, 17 Hot in the morning. 18 Down the 
Staked Plains the color winds 19 Rising through mirage. The 
still 20 Elusive colors graze these hills, 21 Drink at 
these caves, go hunting in this sky. 22 The colors 
feed; or go hunting; or they hear. 23 Pause of 
colors before change. 24 A stranger, from the East, and 
talking fast, 25 Looks at a unique man, 26 The 
man from Tucumcari 27 Knows cattle and tourists. He stares 
at the candidate. 28 The great pure Apache watches from 
his eyes, 29 Ferocious dawns do climb the Walls of 
Bronze. 30 Two from Gallup remember the strike. 31 A 
carpenter from Conchas Dam, 32 A handful of people from 
Mimbres Valley, 33 Alamogordo, the Oscura Mountains, 34 A few 
curiosities down from Taos 35 Listen to Willkie. Spit. Shake 
hands. 36 Out of the throats of volcanoes : rocks 
: volcanoes forgotten : 37 a word craggy and pinnacled: 
38 Shiprock : the shape of a cry issuing : 
as people, as rock: 39 Among the rivers in a 
dry country : invasion of dunes, the white 40 sand 
in the wash : from the cave waters 41 Given, 
erect crystals : pinnacles in the flows : a cap 
of lava over 42 the rock: 43 Cliffs vermilion and 
undermined : retreating cliffs 44 For the rainwash, the sheetflood 
overthrow 45 Reaches them : they deploy, in summer thunderstorms 
46 In the shale, in softness, until the softness goes; 
47 The ruined villages of rock, and the people.
