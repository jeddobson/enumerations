1 A shadowy arch calling the clouds of the sun 
2 To enter, enter. Enter. But they run. 3 Their 
seeking whiteness refuses the false, the thief. 4 This shadow 
is rich twilight of gold leaf. 5 A mask of 
gold beaten upon the stone 6 Is a live cheek 
painted on martyr bone. 7 If you go through the 
gold you find a hand 8 Delicate as foam and 
at the wrist 9 Foam and the scarlet cloth of 
a sick priest. 10 Until he coughs you will not 
understand. 11 You must go deeper to find the pure 
dark way, 12 The many crying "Sangre!" "Sangre!" "Sangre!" 13 
Deeper than death the faithful blood will flow 14 Singing 
"Mexico!" "Mexico!" "Mexico" 15 A serpent in the passionate garden 
says 16 "This," looking at men and saying "this, this." 
17 Pain and the desperate music of the poor. 18 
The true darkness. A naked human door. 19 Out of 
this darkness music of the crowd, 20 Bells raise their 
circles of truth and find the cloud.
