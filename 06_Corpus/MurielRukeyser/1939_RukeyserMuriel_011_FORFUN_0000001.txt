1 It was long before the national performance, 2 preparing 
for heroes, 3 carnival-time, time of 4 political decorations and 
the tearing of treaties. 5 Long before the prophecies came 
true. 6 For cities also play their brilliant lives. 7 
They have their nightmares. They have their nights of peace. 
8 Senility, wisecracks, tomb, tomb. 9 Bunting, plaster of Paris 
whores, electrified unicorns. 10 Pyramids of mirrors and the winking 
sphinx, 11 flower mosaics on the floors of stores, 12 
ballets of massacres. Cut-glass sewers, 13 red velvet hangings stained 
the walls of jails, 14 white lacquer chairs in the 
abortionists', 15 boxers, mummies for policemen, wigs 16 on the 
meat at the butchers', murderers 17 eating their last meal 
under the Arch of Peace. 18 The unemployed brought all 
the orange trees, 19 cypress trees, tubbed rubber-plants, and limes, 
20 conifers, loblolly and the tamaracks, 21 incongruous flowers to 
a grove wherein 22 they sat, making oranges. For in 
that cold season 23 fruit was golden could not be 
guaranteed. 24 It was long before the riderless horse came 
streaming 25 hot to the Square. I walked at noon 
and saw 26 that face run screaming through the crowd 
saying Help 27 but its mouth would not open and 
they could not hear. 28 It was long before the 
troops entered the city 29 that I looked up and 
saw the Floating Man. 30 Explain yourself I cried at 
the last. I am 31 the angel waste, your need 
which is your guilt, 32 answered, affliction and a fascist 
death. 33 It was long before the city was bombed 
I saw 34 fireworks, mirrors, gilt, consumed in flame, 35 
we show this you said the flames, speak it speak 
it 36 but I was employed then making straw oranges. 
37 Everything spoke : flames, city, glass, but I 38 
had heavy mystery thrown against the heart. 39 It was 
long before the fall of the city. 40 Ten days 
before the appearance of the skull. 41 Five days until 
the skull showed clean, 42 and now the entry is 
prepared. 43 Carnival's ready. 44 Let's dance a little before 
we go home to hell.
