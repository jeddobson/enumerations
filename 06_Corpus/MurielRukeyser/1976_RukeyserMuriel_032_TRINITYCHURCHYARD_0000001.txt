for my mother & her ancestor, Akiba 1 Wherever I 
walked I went green among young growing 2 Along the 
same song, Mother, even along this grass 3 Where, Mother, 
tombstones stand each in its pail of shade 4 In 
Trinity yard where you at lunchtime came 5 As a 
young workingwoman, Mother, bunches of your days, 6 grapes 7 
Pressing your life into mine, Mother, 8 And I never 
cared for these tombs and graves 9 But they are 
your book-keeper hours. 10 You said to me summers later, 
deep in your shiniest car 11 As a different woman, 
Mother, and I your poem-making 12 daughter--- 13 "Each evening 
after I worked all day for the lock-people 14 "I 
wished under a green sky on the young evening star--- 
15 "What did I wish for?" What did you wish 
for, Mother? 16 "I wished for a man, of course, 
anywhere in my world, 17 "And there was Trinity graveyard 
and the tall New York 18 steeples." 19 Wherever I 
go, Mother, I stay away from graves 20 But they 
turn everywhere in the turning world; now, 21 Mother Rachel's, 
on the road from Jerusalem. 22 And mine is somewhere 
turning unprepared 23 In the earth or among the whirling 
air. 24 My workingwoman mother is saying to me, Girl--- 
25 Years before her rich needy unreal years--- 26 Whatever 
work you do, always make sure 27 You can go 
walking, not like me, shut in your hours. 28 Mother 
I walk, going even here in green Galilee 29 Where 
our ancestor, Akiba, resisted Rome, 30 Singing forever for the 
Song of Songs 31 Even in torture knowing. Mother, I 
walk, this blue, 32 The Sea, Mother, this hillside, to 
his great white stone. 33 And again here in New 
York later I come alone 34 To you, Mother, I 
walk, making our poems.
