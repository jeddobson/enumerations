1 He turns through the lucid stars of a lit 
city 2 In sleep. He is walking past the snake 
and the spiderthread. 3 "And they do say the rain's 
to come." 4 The flood-woman ankle-deep, staring upon his eyes 
5 In a dream of rivers, water whirls here like 
the sound 6 Of voices, of swans. The faring. Below 
him turns 7 A house swimming, a broken-legged table and 
three chairs. 8 Past him in all that filth, a 
message in a bottle, 9 Too far to reach, and 
four stiff-legged chickens. 10 Ocean of our refusal, pouring its 
waste 11 Over the mind of man. 12 A choice 
between evils. 13 These evils are of us, that we 
did not respond: 14 Poverty, hunger, war. 15 The flood 
and the woman staring upon his eyes. 16 This flowing 
away is the lives of all I love. 17 Are 
you saying this is not water but lives? 18 Of 
course it is water. Fool! Of course it is lives.
