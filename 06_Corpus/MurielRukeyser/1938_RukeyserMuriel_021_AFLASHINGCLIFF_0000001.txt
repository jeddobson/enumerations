1 Spinning on his heel, the traveller 2 sees across 
snow a flashing cliff. 3 Past the plain's freeze, past 
savage branches 4 immune in ice, a frozen waterfall, 5 
clamped in December, glistens alive. 6 Love, will you recognize 
yourself displayed? 7 Or is the age defective, cold with 
storm 8 to lock fast water in iron artifice, 9 
whitening cataracts?---contempt and loss, 10 and nothing, in the great 
world, can lie calm, 11 travel alive, but is frozen 
solid, 12 and will not face its mirror nor speak 
its pain. 13 Will you fight winter to break in 
immense speed 14 resisting and sensitive, a waterfall-flash 15 sparkling 
full across the vicious plain? 16 Fight down our age, 
the mad vindictive time? 17 No victory's here. Now, any 
passion suffers 18 against proud ice, flashing, angry, and jailed. 
19 You, maniac, catalept! 20 And, love. You are all 
rivers.
