1 A tree of rivers flowing through our lives; 2 
These lives moving through their starvation and greatness, 3 Masked 
away from each other, masked in lack. 4 Each woman 
seen as a river through whom lifetime 5 Gives, and 
feeds. Each man seen giving and feeding. 6 Under all 
the images, under all growth and form. The energy 7 
of each, which is relation, 8 A flare of linked 
fire which is the need to grow, 9 The human 
wish for meaning. 10 Roots of diversity 11 Each being 
witness to itself, entering to relate, 12 Bearing the flood, 
the food, the becoming of power, 13 Which is our 
eyes and our lives 14 Related, in bonds of flow.
