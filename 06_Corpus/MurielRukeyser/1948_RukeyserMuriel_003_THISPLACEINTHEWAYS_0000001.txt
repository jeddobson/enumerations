1 Having come to this place 2 I set out 
once again 3 on the dark and marvelous way 4 
from where I began: 5 belief in the love of 
the world, 6 woman, spirit, and man. 7 Having failed 
in all things 8 I enter a new age 9 
seeing the old ways as toys, 10 the houses of 
a stage 11 painted and long forgot; 12 and I 
find love and rage. 13 Rage for the world as 
it is 14 but for what it may be 15 
more love now than last year 16 and always less 
self-pity 17 since I know in a clearer light 18 
the strength of the mystery. 19 And at this place 
in the ways 20 I wait for song. 21 My 
poem-hand still, on the paper, 22 all night long. 23 
Poems in throat and hand, asleep, 24 and my storm 
beating strong!
