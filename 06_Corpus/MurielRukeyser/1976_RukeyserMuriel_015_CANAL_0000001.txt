1 Sea-shouldering Ithaca 2 staring past sunset 3 after the 
islands 4 darkening closing 5 The narrow night. We 6 
came in from Ithaca 7 into the inland 8 narrow 
water 9 trying to keep awake 10 while the ship 
went forward 11 but sleep came down 12 shouldering 13 
down like Ithaca. 14 Night smites, light smites 15 and 
again light 16 in a narrow place 17 of old 
whiteness. 18 We are in 19 the narrowest place 20 
moving in still 21 through an ash-white canal 22 a 
whitened plant 23 grappled to this wall 24 deep-cut, Judean 
slaves 25 cut the narrowest place 26 the ship fares 
into, 27 light smites again 28 the olive-plant in the 
crevice 29 captained through light.
