1 However the voices rise 2 They are the shepherd, 
the king, 3 The woman; dreams, 4 Holy desire. 5 
Whether the voices 6 Be many the dance around 7 
Or body led by one body 8 Whose bed is 
green, 9 I defend the desire 10 Lightning and poetry 
11 Alone in the dark city 12 Or breast to 
breast. 13 Champion of light I am 14 The wounded 
holy light, 15 The woman in her dreams 16 And 
the man answering. 17 You who answer their dreams 18 
Are the ruler of wine 19 Emperor of clouds 20 
And the riches of men. 21 This song 22 Is 
the creation 23 The day of this song 24 The 
day of the birth of the world. 25 Whether a 
thousand years 26 Forget this woman, this king, 27 Whether 
two thousand years 28 Forget the shepherd of dreams. 29 
If none remember 30 Who is lover, who the beloved, 
31 Whether the poet be 32 Woman or man, 33 
The desire will make 34 A way through the wilderness 
35 The leopard mountains 36 And the lips of the 
sleepers. 37 Holy way of desire, 38 King, lion, the 
mouth of the poet, 39 The woman who dreams 40 
And the answerer of dreams. 41 In these delights 42 
Is eternity of seed, 43 The verge of life, 44 
Body of dreaming.
