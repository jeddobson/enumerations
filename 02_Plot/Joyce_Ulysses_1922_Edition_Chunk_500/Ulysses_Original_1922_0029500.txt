yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to make 
it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume 
does your? Peau d’Espagne. That orangeflower. Pure curd soap. Water 
is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps have. Time to 
get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt 
gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice 
girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do 
it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. 
Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel 
fresh then all day. Funeral be rather glum. — Yes, 
sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have 
you brought a bottle? — No, Mr Bloom said. Make 
it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and 
I’ll take one of those soaps. How much are they? 
— Fourpence, sir. Mr Bloom raised a cake to his 
nostrils. Sweet lemony wax. — I’ll take this one, he 
said. That makes three and a penny. — Yes, sir, 
the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when 
you come back. — Good, Mr Bloom said. He strolled 
out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, 
the coolwrappered soap in his left hand. At his armpit 
Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said : — Hello, Bloom, 
what’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a 
minute. Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold 
upper lip. To look younger. He does look balmy. Younger 
than I am. Bantam Lyons’ yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the 
baton. Wants a wash too. Take off the rough dirt. 
Good morning, have you used Pears’ soap. Dandruff on his 
shoulders. Scalp wants oiling. — I want to see about 
that French horse that’s running today, Bantam Lyons’ said. Where 
the bugger is it? He rustled the pleated pages, jerking 
his chin on his high collar. Barber’s itch. Tight collar 
he’ll lose his hair. Better leave him the paper and 
get shut of him. — You can keep it, Mr 
Bloom said. — Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. 
Half a mo. Maximum the second. — I was just 
going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said. Bantam Lyons 
raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly. — What’s that? 
his sharp voice said. — I say you can keep 
it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it 
away that moment. Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering : 
then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms. 
— I’Il risk it, he said. Here, thanks. He sped 
off towards Conway’s corner. God speed scut. Mr Bloom folded 
the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the 
soap in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. 
Regular hotbed of it lately. Messenger boys stealing to put 
on sixpence. Raffle for large tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner 
for threepence. Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off 
to America. Keeps a hotel now. They never come back.
