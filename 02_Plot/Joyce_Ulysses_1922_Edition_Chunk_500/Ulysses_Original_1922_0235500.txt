of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding 
part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to 
his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then 
with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguial fragment. Why with 
satisfaction? Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled 
of other unguial fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, 
pupil of Mrs Ellis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in 
the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious 
meditation. In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive
