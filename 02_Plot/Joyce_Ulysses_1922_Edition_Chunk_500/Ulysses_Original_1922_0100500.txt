That rules the world. Far. Far. Far. Far. Tap. Tap. 
Tap. Tap. Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with 
letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for 
Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on. Tap 
blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap 
by tap. Cowley, he stuns himself with it; kind of 
drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of 
a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not 
lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. 
You daren’t budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle 
about notes. All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant 
when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in 
Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up 
there in the cockloft alone with stops and locks and 
keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for 
hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the 
bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding 
or something in his no don’t she cried), then all 
of a soft sudden wee little wee little pippy wind. 
Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom’s little 
wee. — Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning, with fetched 
pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little

Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out! — ’lldo! cried 
Father Cowley. Rrrrrr. I feel I want… Tap. Tap. Tap. 
Tap. Tap. — Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at 
a headless sardine. Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier 
of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. 
Bloom alone. — Very, he stared. The lower register, for 
choice. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Bloom 
went by Barry’s. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if 
I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Litigation. Love 
one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have 
power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward. But for example the 
chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation : Micky 
Rooney’s band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at 
home after pig’s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the 
armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the 
wife. Asses’ skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after 
death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak 
or I mean kismet. Fate. Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind,
