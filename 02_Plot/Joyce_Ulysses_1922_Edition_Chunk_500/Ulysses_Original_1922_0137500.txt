History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I’m with you 
once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. 
And now? Sad about her lame of course but must 
be on your guard not to feel too much pity. 
They take advantage. All quiet on Howth now. The distant 
hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool 
perhaps. He gets the plums and I the plumstones. Where 
I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names 
change : that’s all. Lovers : yum yum. Tired I 
feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all 
the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. 
My youth. Never again. Only once it comes. Or hers. 
Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. 
Like kids your second visit to a house. The new 
I want. Nothing new under the sun. Care of P. 
O. Dolphin’s barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty 
darling. At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s house. Mat 
Dillon and his bevy of daughters : Tiny, Atty, Floey, 
Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before 
we. And the old major partial to his drop of 
spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. 
So it returns. Think you’re escaping and run into yourself. 
Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just

leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep 
in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. 
His gun rusty from the drew. Ba. What is that 
flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I’m a tree, so 
blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could 
be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. 
There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. 
Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in 
the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. 
Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at 
it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray 
for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. 
Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there’s the 
light in the priest’s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about 
the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s. 
Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy’s brother 
is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at 
night like mice. They’re a mixed breed. Birds are like 
hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit 
still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water 
out of the end of a jar by throwing in 
pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is 
with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind
