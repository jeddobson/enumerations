teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t 
lend each other a pinch of salt. Ah! Devils they 
are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Molly 
often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the 
sole of my foot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! 
Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a 
way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. 
Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something 
about withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they 
say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt. 
All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like 
that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or 
what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting 
: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the 
same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone 
or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently 
does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark 
and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner 
have me as I am than some poet chap with 
bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid 
gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my 
age. Didn’t let her see me in profile. Still, you 
never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and 
the beast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took 
off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim bought 
to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend 
down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair

when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why 
not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a 
prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more a pound. What? I 
think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand. Mrs Marion. 
Did I forget to write address on that letter like 
the postcard I sent to Flynn. And the day I 
went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it 
was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding. He’s 
another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at 
half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to 
clean could do it myself. Save. Was that just when 
he, she? O, he did. Into her. She did. Done. 
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. 
O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold 
and clammy After effect not pleasant. Still you have to 
get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented perhaps. 
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night 
prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren’t they. See her as 
she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the 
rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. 
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver 
effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and
