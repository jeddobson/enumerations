knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command 
her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct 
her faith I will that was the last time she 
turned on the teartap I was just like that myself

of course having the two of us slaving here instead 
of getting in a woman long ago am I ever 
going to have a proper servant again of course then

the pots well of course shes old she cant help

dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there 
was something and opened the window to let out the 
smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the 
night he walked home with a dog if you please 
that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his 
father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his 
tall hat on him at the cricket match and a 
great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at 
the other and his son that got all those prizes 
for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing 
over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us 
wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand 
funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough 
for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen 
now is he right in his head I ask pity 
it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might 
have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition 
for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the 
stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was

I told her and now shes going such as she 
was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres 
always something wrong with them disease or they have to 
go under an operation or if its not that its 
drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around

new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im 
stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have 
some peace I want to get up a minute if
