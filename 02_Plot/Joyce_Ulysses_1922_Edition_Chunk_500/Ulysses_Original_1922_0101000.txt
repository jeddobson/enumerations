a mermaid, hair all streaming (but he couldn’t see), blew 
whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn’t), mermaid coolest whiff of 
all. Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, 
then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a 
tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street 
west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made 
its own, don’t you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. 
Have you the? Cloche. Sonnez la! Shepherd his pipe. Policeman 
a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o’clock’s all’s well! 
Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait, I know. 
Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor 
little nominedomine. Pom. It is music, I mean of course 
it’s all pom pom pom very much what they call 
da capo. Still you can hear. As we march, we 
march along, march along. Pom. I must really. Fff. Now 
if I did that at a banquet. Just a question 
of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a 
tear. All the same he must have been a bit 
of a natural not to see it was a yeoman 
cap. Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the 
grave in the brown mackin. O, the whore of the 
lane! A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew 
came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr 
Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing. Yes, it 
is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. 
Horn. Who had the? Heehaw. Shesaw. Off her beat here. 
What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your 
wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be 
with you in the brown costume. Put you off your 
stroke. That appointment we made. Knowing we’d never, well hardly 
ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees 
me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face 
like dip. Damn her! O, well, she has to live 
like the rest. Look in here. In Lionel Marks’s antique 
saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly 
Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged candlestick melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain 
: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her 
pass. Course everything is dear if you don’t want it. 
That’s what good salesman is. Make you buy what he 
wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he 
shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge 
he gave it. She’s passing now. Six bob. Must be 
the cider or perhaps the burgund. Near bronze from anear 
near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, 
brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia’s tempting last rose of 
summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, 
a fifth : Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and 
Big Ben Dollard. Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond 
hall. Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks’s 
window. Robert Emmet’s last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer
