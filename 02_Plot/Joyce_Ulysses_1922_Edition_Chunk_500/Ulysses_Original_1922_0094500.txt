Get up. By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant 
jingle jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed at meat fit for 
princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they 
raised and drank Power and cider. Most beautiful tenor air 
ever written, Richie said : Sonambula. He heard Joe Maas 
sing that one night. Ah, that M’Guckin! Yes. In his 
way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical 
tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never. Tenderly Bloom 
over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. 
Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the 
piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave 
it off awhile. Sings too : Down among the dead 
men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much 
hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. 
Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry 
water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a 
sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he’s wanted not 
a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types. 
Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he 
lived, never. In the gods of the old Royal with 
little Peake. And when the first note. Speech paused on 
Richie’s lips. Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about 
damn all. Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. 
But want a good memory. — Which air is that? 
asked Leopold Bloom. — All is lost now. Richie cocked 
his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured 
: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good 
teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. 
Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard 
in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and 
turned them. All most too new call is lost in 
all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? 
All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost. Bloom 
bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under 
the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep 
she went to him. Innocence in the moon Still hold 
her back. Brave, don’t know their danger. Call name. Touch 
water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That’s 
why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes : all 
is lost. — A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. 
I know it well. Never in all his life had 
Richie Goulding. He knows it well too. Or he feels. 
Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her 
father, Dedalus said. Me? Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face 
of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old 
stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now 
begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir 
I did sir. Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some 
money. Apologise. Piano again. Sounds better than last time I 
heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again. Dollard and Cowley still urged
