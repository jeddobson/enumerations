of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. 
Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the 
resonance changes according as the weight of the water is 
equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies 
of Liszt’s, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddle iddle addle 
addle oodle oodle. Hiss. Now. Maybe now. Before. One rapped 
on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he 
knock Paul de Kock, with a loud proud knocker, with 
a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock. Tap. — Qui sdegno, Ben, 
said Father Cowley. — No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered, The 
Croppy Boy. Our native Doric. — Ay do, Ben, Mr 
Dedalus said. Good men and true. — Do, do, they 
begged in one. I’ll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He 
came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How 
much? — What key? Six sharps? — F sharp major, 
Ben Dollard said. Bob Cowley’s outstretched talons gripped the black 
deepsounding chords. Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, 
Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He’s on for 
a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and 
nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, 
bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting 
Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while 
they wait. But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. 
In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore.

made grave approach, and painful, come from afar, from hoary 
mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he

Dollard’s voice base barreltone. Doing his level best to say 
it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. 
Big ships’ chandler’s business he did once. Remember : rosiny 
ropes, ships’ lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand 
pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and

in. The holy father. Curlycues of chords. Ruin them. Wreck 
their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days

of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered 
a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footstep
