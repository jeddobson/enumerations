hate people who come at all hours answer the door 
you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you 
all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen 
blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the 
concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all 
flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at 
me professor I had to say Im a fright yes 
but he was a real old gent in his way 
it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say 
youre out you have to peep out through the blind 
like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff 
first him sending the port and the peaches first and 
I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he 
was trying to make a fool of me when I 
knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been 
a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when 
I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I 
never know the time even that watch he gave me 
never seems to go properly Id want to get it 
looked after when I threw the penny to that lame 
sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling 
there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt 
even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or 
a thing then this day week were to go to 
Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis 
his fathers anniversary the 27 th it wouldnt be pleasant 
if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were 
beside each other and any fooling went on in the 
new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not 
bother me with him in the next room or perhaps 
some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall 
then he wouldnt believe next day we didnt do something 
its all very well a husband but you cant fool 
a lover after me telling him we never did anything 
of course he didnt believe me no its better hes 
going where he is besides something always happens with him 
the time going to the Mallow Concert at Maryborough ordering 
boiling soup for the two of us then the bell 
rang out he walks down the platform with the soup 
splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve 
and the waiter after him making a holy show of 
us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but 
he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen 
in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right 
so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he 
gets a thing into his head a good job he 
was able to open the carriage door with his knife 
or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose 
that was done out of revenge on him O I 
love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely
