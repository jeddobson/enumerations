actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit 
telling me all her ailments she had too much old 
chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end 
of the world let us have a bit of fun 
first God help the world if all the women were 
her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody 
wanted her to wear I suppose she was pious because 
no man would look at her twice I hope Ill 
never be like her a wonder she didnt want us 
to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman 
certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and 
Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get 
shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and 
always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then 
still I like that in him polite to old women 
like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud 
out of nothing but not always if ever he got 
anything really serious the matter with him its much better 
for them go into a hospital where everything is clean 
but I suppose Id have to dring it into him 
for a month yes and then wed have a hospital 
nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there 
till they throw him out or a nun maybe like 
the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun 
as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling 
when theyre sick they want a woman to get well 
if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic 
and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he 
sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloof 
Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing 
him flowers the worst old ones she could find at 
the bottom of the basket anything at all to get 
into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying 
to imagine he was dying on account of her to 
never see thy face again though he looked more like 
a man with his beard a bit grown in the 
bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and 
dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring 
his corns afraid hed get blood poisoning but if it 
was a thing I was sick then wed see what 
attention only of course the woman hides it not to 
give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere 
Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or 
hed be off his feed thinking of her so either 
it was one of those night women if it was 
down there he was really and the hotel story he 
made up a pack of lies to hide it planning 
it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes 
I met do you remember Menton and who else who 
let me see that big babbyface I saw him and
