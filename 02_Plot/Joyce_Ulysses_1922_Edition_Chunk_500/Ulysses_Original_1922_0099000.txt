slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben’s contrite beard confessed : in nomine 
Domini, in God’s name. He knelt. He beat his hand 
upon his breast, confessing : mea culpa. Latin again. That 
holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for 
those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. 
Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape. Tap. They 
listened : tankards and Miss Kennedy, George Lidwell eyelid well 
expressive, fullbusted satin, Kernan, Si. The sighing voice of sorrow 
sang. His sins. Since easter he had cursed three times. 
You bitch’s bast. And once at masstime he had gone 
to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and 
for his mother’s rest he had not prayed. A boy. 
A croppy boy. Bronze, listening by the beerpull, gazed far 
away. Soulfully. Doesn’t half know I’m. Molly great dab at 
seeing anyone looking. Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is 
that best side of her face? They always know. Knock 
at the door. Last tip to titivate. Cockcarracarra. What do 
they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. 
Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah 
of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet 
home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country 
perhaps. That’s music too. Not as bad as it sounds. 
Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses, helpless, gashes in 
their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath 
jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin’s name. She looked fine. Her crocus 
dress she wore, lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath 
was always in theatre when she bent to ask a 
question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of 
poor papa’s. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap 
in dresscircle, staring down into her with his operaglass for 
all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear 
twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country 
man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks! 
All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his 
father, at Gorey all his brothers fell To Wexford, we 
are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his 
name and race. I too, last my race. Milly young 
student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late 
now. Or if not? If not? If still? He bore 
no hate. Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I 
am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice, Richie 
Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom, 
soon old but when was young. Ireland comes now. My 
country above the King. She listens. Who fears to speak 
of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough. — 
Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and 
let me go. Tap. Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got 
up to kill : on eighteen bob a week. Fellows 
shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. 
Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl’s
