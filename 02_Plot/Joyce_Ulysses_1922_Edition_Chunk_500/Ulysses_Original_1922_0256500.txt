spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher 
functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak 
caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense 
and me more money I suppose theyre called after him 
I never tho ught that would be my name Bloom 
when I used to write it in print to see 
how it looked on a visiting card or practising for 
the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie 
used to say after I married him well its better 
than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names 
with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind 
of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either 
or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother wh≈ìver 
she was might have given me a nicer name the 
Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo 
the fun we had running along Willis road to Europe 
point twisting in and out all round the other side 
of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my 
blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up 
the stairs I loved looking down at them I was 
jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars 
pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he 
went to India he was to write the voyages those 
men have to make to the ends of the world 
and back its the least they might get a squeeze 
or two at a woman while they can going out 
to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up 
windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with Captain 
Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he 
said hed have one or two from on board I 
wore that frock from the B Marche Paris and the 
coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to 
Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas 
mountain with snow on it and the straits like a 
river so clear Harry Molly Darling I was thinking of 
him on the sea all the time after at mass 
when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation 
weeks and weeks I kept the handerchief under my pillow 
for the smell of him there was no decent perfume 
to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau 
despagne that faded and left a stink on you more 
than anything else I wanted to give him a memento 
he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that 
I gave Gardner going to South Africa where those Boers 
killed him with their war and fever but they were 
well beaten all the same as if it brought its 
bad luck with it like an opal or pearl must 
have been pure 16 carat gold because it was very 
heavy I can see his face clean shaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that 
train again weeping tone once in the dear deaead days
