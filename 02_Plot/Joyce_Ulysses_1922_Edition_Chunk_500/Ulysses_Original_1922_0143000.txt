witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that 
he was able to do any manner of thing that 
lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right 
jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst 
laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which 
he would not bewray and also for that he rued 
for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. 
Then spoke young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would 
cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, 
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind 
of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth
