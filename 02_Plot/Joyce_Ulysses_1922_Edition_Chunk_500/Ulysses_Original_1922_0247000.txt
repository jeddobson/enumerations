so I didnt want to let him know more than 
was good for him she used to be always embracing 
me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course 
glauming me over and when I said I washed up 
and down as far as possible asking me did you 
wash possible the women are always egging on to that 
putting it on thick when hes there they know by 
his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent 
when they come out with something the kind he is 
what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because 
he was very handsome at that time trying to look 
like lord Byron I said I liked though he was 
too beautiful for a man and he was a little 
before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it 
so much the day I was in fits of laughing 
with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins 
falling one after another with the mass of hair I 
had youre always in great humour she said yes because 
it grigged her because she knew what it meant because 
I used to tell her a good bit of what 
went on between us not all but just enough to 
make her month water but that wasnt my fault she 
didnt darken the door much after we were married I 
wonder what shes got like now after living with that 
dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to 
look drawn and run down the last time I saw 
her she must have been just after a row with 
him because I saw on the moment she was edging 
to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about 
him to run him down what was it she told 
me O yes that sometimes he used to go to 
bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes 
him just imagine having to get into bed with a 
thing like that that might murder you any moment what 
a man well its not the one way everyone goes 
mad Poldy anyway whatever he does always wipes his feet 
on the mat when he comes in wet or shine 
and always blacks his own boots too and he always 
takes off his hat when he comes up in the 
street like that and now hes going about in his 
slippers to look for Â£ 10000 for a postcard up 
up O Sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply 
bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to 
take his boots off now what could you make of 
a man like that Id rather die 20 times over 
than marry another of their sex of course hed never 
find another woman like me to put up with him 
the way I do know me come sleep with me 
yes and he knows that too at the bottom of 
his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband
