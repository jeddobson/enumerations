you cant help yourself I wish some man or other 
would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me 
in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and 
hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I 
hate that confession when I used to go to Father 
Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he 
did where and I said on the canal bank like 
a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on 
the leg behind high up was it yes rather high 
up was it where you sit down yes O Lord 
couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with 
it what has that got to do with it and 
did you whatever way he put it I forget no

paste they stick their bills up with some liquor Id 
like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks 
those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted 
once with my finger dipped out of that American that 
had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all

the last time we took the port and potted meat 
it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt 
lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as 
a top the moment I popped straight into bed till 
that thunder woke me up as if the world was
