now with the hands hanging off me looking out of 
the window if there was a nice fellow even in 
the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse 
was after when I put on my gloves and hat 
at the window to show I was going out not 
a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand 
what you say even youd want to print it up 
on a big poster for them not even if you 
shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me 
either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row 
chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like 
to know grey matter they have it all in their 
tail if you ask me those country gougers up in 
the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less 
than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat 
and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle 
me with the wrong bill he took out of his 
hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans 
and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor 
man today and no visitors or post ever except his 
cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him 
addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from 
Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him 
who did I get the last letter from O Mrs 
Dwenn now whatever possessed her to write after so many 
years to know the recipe I had for pisto madrileno 
Floey Dillon since she wrote to say she was married 
to a very rich architect if Im to believe all

was an awfully nice man he was near seventy always 
good humour well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie theres 
the pyannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he 
had too on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far

to tell everybody has their own troubles that poor Nancy 
Blake died a month ago of acute pneumonia well I 
didnt know her so well as all that she was 
Floeys friend more than mine its a bother having to 
answer he always tells me the wrong things and no 
stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement

double yous in I hope hell write me a longer 
letter the next time if its a thing he really 
likes me O thanks be to the great God I 
got somebody to give me what I badly wanted to
