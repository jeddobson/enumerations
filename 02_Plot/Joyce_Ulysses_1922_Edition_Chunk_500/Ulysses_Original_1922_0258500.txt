with the earrings I dont like a man you have 
to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre 
all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like 
being alone in this big barracks of a place at 
night I suppose Ill have to put up with it 
I never brought a bit of salt in even when 
we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going 
to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate 
or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself 
altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like 
all the things he told father he was going to 
do and me but I saw through him telling me 
all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon 
Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of 
Como he had a picture cut out of some paper 
of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said 
whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if 
not sooner will you be my man will you carry 
my can he ought to get a leather medal with 
a putty rim for all the plans he invents then 
leaving us here all day youd never know what old 
beggar at the door for a crust with his long 
story might be a tramp and put his foot in 
the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture 
of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloydâ€™s Weekly 
News 20 years in jail then he comes out and 
murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor 
wife or mother or whoever she is such a face 
youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till 
I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure 
but its worse again being locked up like in a 
prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot 
or the cat of nine tails a big brute like 
that that would attack a poor old woman to murder 
her in her bed Id cut them off so I 
would not that hed be much use still better than 
nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in 
the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with 
a candle and a poker as if he was looking 
for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out 
of his wits making as much noise as he possibly 
could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal 
indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now 
with Milly away such an idea for him to send 
the girl down there to learn to take photographs on 
account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys 
academy where shed have to learn not like me getting 
all at school only hed do a thing like that 
all the same on account of me and Boylan thats 
why he did it Im certain the way he plots
