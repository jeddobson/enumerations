sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with 
their kilts in time at the march past the ioth 
hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O 
the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela 
his father made his money over selling the horses for 
the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present 
up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely 
linen up there or one of those nice kimono things 
I must buy a mothball like I had before to 
keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting 
going around with him shopping buying those things in a 
new city better leave this ring behind want to keep 
turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there 
or they might bell it round the town in their 
papers or tell the police on me but theyd think 
were married O let them all go and smother themselves 
for the fat lot I care he has plenty of 
money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better

I wished I could have picked every morsel of that
