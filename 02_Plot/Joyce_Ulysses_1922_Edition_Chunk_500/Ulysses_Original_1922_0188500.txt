want three girls? It’s ten shillings here. stephen (Delightedly.) A 
hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and 
hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is 
somewhat troubled. (Bella goes to the table to count the 
money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllabbes. Zoe bounds 
over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe’s neck. Lynch 
gets up, rights his cap and clasping Kitty’s waist, adds 
his head to the group.) florry (Strives heavily to rise.) 
Ow! My foot’s asleep. (She limps over to the table. 
Bloom approaches.) bella, zoe, kitty, lynch, bloom (Chattering and squabbling.) 
The gentleman… ten shillings… paying for the three… allow me 
a moment… this gentleman pays separate… who’s touching it?… ow… 
mind who you’re pinching… are you staying the night or 
a short time?… who did?… you’re a liar, excuse me… 
the gentleman paid down like a gentleman… drink… it’s long 
after eleven. stephen (At the pianola, making a gesture of 
abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle. zoe (Lifting up 
her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top 
of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my
