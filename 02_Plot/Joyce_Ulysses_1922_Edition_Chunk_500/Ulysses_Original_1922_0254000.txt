read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries 
of course they never come back and she didnt put 
her address right on it either she may have noticed 
her wogger people were always going away and we never 
I remember that day with the waves and the boats 
with their high heads rocking and the swell of the 
ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick 
he didnt say anything he was very serious I had 
the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing 
she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry 
yes I believe I did or near it my lips 
were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous 
wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her 
for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like 
and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as 
the devil after they went I was almost planning to 
run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy 
where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always 
waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his 
flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over 
the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down 
in all directions of you didnt open the windows when 
general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to 
be some great fellow landed off the ship and old 
Sprague the codsul that was there from before the flood 
dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the 
son then the same old reveille in the morning and 
drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking 
about with messtins smelling the place more than the old 
longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound 
clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines 
and the warden marching with his keys to lock the 
gates and the bagpipes and only Captain Groves and father 
talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley 
and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime 
they went out drunken old devil with his grog on 
the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his 
nose trying to think of some other dirty story to 
tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself 
when I was there sending me out of the room 
on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky 
talking of course but hed do the same to the 
next woman that came along I supposed he died of 
galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a 
letter from a living soul except the odd few I 
posted to myself with bits of paper in them so 
bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to 
that old Arab with the one eye and his heass 
of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my 
compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as
