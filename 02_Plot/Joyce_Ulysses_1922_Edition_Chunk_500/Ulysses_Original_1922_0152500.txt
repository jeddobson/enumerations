into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of 
Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, 
to restrain. The moment was too propitious for the display 
of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union 
among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was 
successively eviscerated : the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the 
Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that 
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case 
known as the Childs murder and rendered memorable by the 
impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal 
of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s 
bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated and 
dissimulated, acardiac foetus in foetu, aprosopia due to a congestion, 
the agnatia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate 
Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs 
along the medial line so that (as he said) one 
ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of 
anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolungation of labour pains in 
advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the 
premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the 
actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, 
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb 
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of 
the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent 
rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers 
Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multigeminal, twikindled and monstruous births 
conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — 
in a word all the cases of human nativity which 
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The 
gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with 
as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the 
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid 
woman to step over a country stile lest, by her 
movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction 
upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and 
ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of 
her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat 
of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s 
inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one 
as a primafacie and natural hypothetical explanation of swineheaded (the 
case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired 
infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced 
by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions 
of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases 
an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to 
the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views 
with such heat as almost carried conviction the theory of 
copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority 
being his own avouchment in support of fables such as 
that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant
