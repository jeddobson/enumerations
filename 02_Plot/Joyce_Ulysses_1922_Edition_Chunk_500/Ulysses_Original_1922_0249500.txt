soft cushions I wonder will he take a ist class 
for me he might want to do it in the 
train by tipping the guard well O I suppose thereâ€™ll 
be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with 
their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be 
that was an exceptional man that common workman that left 
us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth 
Id like to find out something about him 1 or 
2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of 
the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I 
never came back what would they say eloped with him 
that gets you on on the stage the last concert 
I sang at where its over a year ago when 
was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of 
missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like 
on account of father being in the army and my 
singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord 
Roberts when I had the map of it all and 
Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this 
time I wouldnt put it past him like he got 
me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going 
around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music 
I put him up to that till the jesuits found 
out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou 
me on copied from some old opera yes and he 
was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately 
or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and 
nonsense he says that little man he showed me without 
the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffith is 
he well he doesnt look it thats all I can 
say still it must have been him he knew there 
was a boycott I hate the mention of politics after 
the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner 
Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of 
enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and 
just the right height over me Im sure he was 
brave too he said I was lovely the evening we 
kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he 
was pale with excitement about going away or wed be 
seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I 
so hot as I never felt they could have made 
their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and 
the rest of the old Krugers go and fight it 
out between them instead of dragging on for years killing 
any finelooking men there were with their fever if he 
was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad 
I love to see a regiment pass in review the 
first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque 
it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras 
all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those
