of course hes not natural like the rest of the 
world that I what did he say I could give 
9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her 
what does that mean I asked him I forget what 
he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the 
man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats 
so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere 
I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so 
I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used 
to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on 
the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what 
are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight 
on the brow and part which is my brown part 
he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too 
my low notes he was always raving about if you 
can believe him I liked the way he used his 
mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do 
that there in a place like that I dont see 
anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that 
some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill 
take him there and show him the very place too 
we did it so now there you are like it 
or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him 
knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we 
were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap 
as he did he was io times worse himself anyhow 
begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off 
my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth Square 
he kissed me in the eye of my glove and 
I had to take it off asking me questions is 
it permitted to inquire the shape of my bedroom so 
I let him keep it as if I forgot it 
to think of me when I saw him slip it 
into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject 
of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at 
those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing 
up to their navels even when Milly and I were 
out with him at the open air fete that one 
in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so 
he could see every atom she had on when he 
saw me from behind following in the rain I saw 
him before he saw me however standing at the corner 
of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on 
him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show 
off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as 
usual what was he doing there where hed no business 
they can go and get whatever they like from anything 
at all with a skirt on it and were not 
to ask any questions but they want to know where 
were you where are you going I could feel him
