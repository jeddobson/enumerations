and peered. Letter? No. Can’t read. Better go. Better. I’m 
tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those 
holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what 
you find. Bottle with story of a treasure in it 
thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to 
throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the 
waters. What’s this? Bit of stick. O! Exhausted that female 
has me. Not so young now. Will she come here 
tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. 
Murderers do. Will I? Mr Bloom with his stick gently 
vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message 
for her. Might remain. What? I. Some flatfoot tramp on 
it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here 
a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, 
dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with 
lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they 
don’t know. What is the meaning of that other world. 
I called you naughty boy because I do not like. 
AM. A. No room. Let it go. Mr Bloom effaced 
the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing

she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I 
won’t go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. 
Just close my eyes a moment. Won’t sleep though. Half 
dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm 
in him. Just a few. O sweety all your little 
girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love

lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next 
in her next her next. A bat flew. Here. There. 
Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom

Just for a few. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. The clock on 
the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon O’Hanlon 
and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. 
were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton 
chops with catsup and talking about Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Because
