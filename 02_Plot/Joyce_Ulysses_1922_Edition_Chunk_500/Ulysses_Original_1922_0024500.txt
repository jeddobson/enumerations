paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time. The 
postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with 
a letter. He thanked and glanced rapidly at the typed 
envelope. Henry Flower, Esq, c/o P. O. Westland Row, City. 
Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, 
reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment? 
Castoff soldier. There : bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, 
he’s a grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is : royal 
Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the 
women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. 
Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at 
night : disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s paper is 
on the same tack now : an army rotten with 
venereal disease : overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they 
look : hypnotised like. Eyes front. Mark time. Table : 
able. Bed : ed. The King’s own. Never see him 
dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, 
yes. He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to 
the right. Talk : as if that would mend matters. 
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt 
its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it 
open in jerks. Women will pay a lot of heed, 
I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the letter and 
crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on : 
photo perhaps. Hair? No. M’Coy. Get rid of him quickly. 
Take me out of my way. Hate company when you. 
— Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to? — Hello, 
M’Coy. Nowhere in particular. — How’s the body? — Fine. 
How are you? — Just keeping alive, M’Coy said. His 
eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with 
low respect : — Is there any… no trouble I 
hope? I see you’re… — O no, Mr Bloom said. 
Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today. — To 
be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time? A 
photo it isn’t. A badge maybe. — E… eleven, Mr 
Bloom answered. — I must try to get out there, 
M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard it last 
night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy? — 
I know. Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the 
outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The 
porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood 
still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched 
his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that 
roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like 
blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those 
patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. 
Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome 
is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable 
Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once 
take the starch out of her. — I was with
