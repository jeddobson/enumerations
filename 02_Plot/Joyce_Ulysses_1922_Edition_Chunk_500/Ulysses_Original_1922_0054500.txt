of him. It’s a great shame for them whoever he 
is. — Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said. She took 
back the card, sighing. — And now he’s going round 
to Mr Menton’s office. He’s going to take an action 
for ten thousand pounds, he says. She folded the card 
into her untidy bag and snapped the catch. Same blue 
serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. 
Seen its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And 
that dowdy toque, three old grapes to take the harm 
out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a 
tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or 
so older than Molly. See the eye that woman gave 
her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex. He looked still at 
her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle 
oxtail mulligatawny. I’m hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the 
gusset of her dress : daub of sugary flour stuck 
to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit 
interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle’s long’ ago, 
Dolphin’s Barn, the charades. U.P. : up. Change the subject. 
— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy, Mr 
Bloom asked. — Mina Purefoy? she said. Philip Beaufoy I 
was thinking. Playgoers’ club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. 
Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act. — 
Yes. — I just called to ask on the way 
in is she over it. She’s in the lying-in hospital 
in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She’s three 
days bad now. — O, Mr Bloom said. I’m sorry 
to hear that. — Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a 
houseful of kids at home. It’s a very stiff birth, 
the nurse told me. — O, Mr Bloom said. His 
heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in 
compassion. Dth! Dth! — I’m sorry to hear that, he 
said. Poor thing! Three days! That’s terrible for her. Mrs 
Breen nodded. — She was taken bad on the Tuesday….. 
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her. — Mind! 
Let this man pass. A bony form strode along the 
curbstone from the river, staring with a rapt gaze into 
the sunlight through a heavy stringed glass. Tight as a 
skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm 
a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to 
his stride. — Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always 
walks outside the lampposts. Watch! — Who is he if 
it’s a fair question. Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty? 
— His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, 
Mr Bloom said, smiling. Watch! — He has enough of 
them, she said. Denis will be like that one of 
these days. She broke off suddenly. — There he is, 
she said. I must go after him. Good bye. Remember 
me to Molly, won’t you? — I will, Mr Bloom 
said. He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.
