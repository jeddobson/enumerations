about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett 
match? — No, says Joe. — I heard So and 
So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf. 
— Who? Blazes? says Joe. And says Bloom : — 
What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility 
and training of the eye. — Ay, Blazes, says Alf. 
He let out that Myler was on the beer to 
run up the odds and he swatting all the time. 
— We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. 
We know what put English gold in his pocket. — 
True for you, says Joe. And Bloom cuts in again 
about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking 
Alf : — Now don’t you think, Bergan? — Myler 
dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers 
was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the 
father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper 
not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. 
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind. 
Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never 
ate. It was a historic and a hefty battle when 
Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for 
the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by 
lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it 
by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks 
was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had 
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which 
Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman 
putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and 
Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business 
leading off with a powerful left jab to which the 
Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush
