greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death 
written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might 
go first himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The 
right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an 
odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when 
he kicks out. Alleluia. — Just another spasm, Ned Lambert 
said. — What is it? Mr Bloom asked. — A 
recently discovered fragment of Cicero’s, professor Mac Hugh answered with 
pomp of tone. Our lovely land. SHORT BUT TO THE 
POINT — Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply. — Most 
pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an 
accent on the whose. — Dan Dawson’s land, Mr Dedalus 
said. — Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom 
asked. Ned Lambert nodded. — But listen to this, he 
said. The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of 
the back as the door was pushed in. — Excuse 
me, J.J. O’Molloy said, entering. Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside. 
— I beg yours, he said. — Good day, Jack. 
— Come in. Come in. — Good day. — How 
are you, Dedalus? — Well. And yourself? J.J. O’Molloy shook 
his head. SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he

in the wind, I wonder. Money worry. — Or again 
if we but climb the serried mountain peaks. — You’re 
looking extra. — Is the editor to be seen? J.J. 
O’Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door. — Very much 
so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He’s 
in his sanctum with Lenehan. J.J. O’Molloy strolled Jo the 
sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages 
of the file. Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. 
Debts of honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good 
retainers from D. and T. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show 
their grey matter. Brains on their sleeve like the statue 
in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the 
Express with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began on 
the Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about 
when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot 
and cold in the same breath. Wouldn’t know which to 
believe. One story good till you hear the next. Go 
for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all 
blows over. Hailfellow well met the next moment. — Ah, 
listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. Or 
again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks… — 
Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated 
windbag! — Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, towering high on 
high, to bathe our souls, as it were… — Bathe 
his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? 
Is he taking anything for it? — As ’twere, in
