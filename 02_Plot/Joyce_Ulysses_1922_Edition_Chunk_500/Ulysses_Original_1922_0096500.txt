who smoked. Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. 
Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let 
people get fond of each other : lure them on. 
Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. 
Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat’s tail wriggling! Five bob 
I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker : belly like a 
poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too. And one 
day she with. Leave her : get tired. Suffer then. 
Snivel. Big Spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevy hair 
un comb : ’d. Yet too much happy bores. He 
stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. 
It snapped. Jingle into Dorset street. Miss Douce withdrew her 
satiny arm, reproachful, pleased. — Don’t make half so free, 
said she, till we are better acquainted. George Lidwell told 
her really and truly : but she did not believe. 
First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him 
was that so. And second tankard told her so. That 
that was so. Miss Douce, Miss Lydia, did not believe 
: Miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe : George Lidwell, 
no : Miss Dou did not : the first, the 
first : gent with the tank : believe, no, no 
: did not, Miss Kenn : Lidlydiawell : the tank. 
Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and 
twisted. Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen 
and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad 
to blot. He heard, deaf Pat. — Yes, Mr Bloom 
said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few 
lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music 
is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know 
better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope : unconcerned. It’s so 
characteristic. — Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said. 
— It is, Bloom said. Numbers it is. All music 
when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided 
by half is twice one. Vibrations : chords those are. 
One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you 
like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to 
that, symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn’t see my 
mourning. Callous : all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And 
you think you’re listening to the etherial. But suppose you 
said it like : Martha, seven times nine minus x 
is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It’s on account of 
the sounds it is. Instance he’s playing now. Improvising. Might 
be what you like till you hear the words. Want 
to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right : then hear 
chords a bit off : feel lost a bit. In 
and out of sacks over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. 
Time makes the tune. Question of mood you’re in. Still 
always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls 
learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos 
for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing
