night watchman. Stephen turned in surprise. — Gumley? he said. 
You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is 
he? — Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let 
Gumley mind the stones, see they don’t run away. Look 
at here. What did Ignatius Gallaher do? I’ll tell you. 
Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have you Weekly Freeman 
of 17 March? Right. Have you got that? He flung 
back pages of the files and stuck his finger on 
a point. — Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee 
let us say. Have you got that? Right. The telephone 
whirred. A DISTANT VOICE — I’ll answer it, the professor 
said going. — B is parkgate. Good. His finger leaped 
and struck point after point, vibrating. — T is viceregal 
lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon 
gate. The loose flesh of his neck shook like a 
cock’s wattles. An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a

— F to P is the route Skin-the-goat drove the

I ere I saw Elba. — History! Myles Crawford cried. 
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first. Thee
