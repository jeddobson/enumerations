could have a child that big taken out of her 
and I thought first it came out of her side 
because how could she go to the chamber when she 
wanted to and she a rich lady of course she 
felt honoured H. R. H. he was in Gibraltar the 
year I was born I bet he found lilies there 
too where he planted the tree he planted more than 
that in his time he might have planted me too 
if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be 
here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman 
with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it 
and go into an office or something where hed get 
regular pay or a bank where they could put him 
up on a throne to count the money all the 
day of course he prefers plottering about the house so 
you cantstir with him any side whats your programme today 
I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to 
get the smell of a man or pretending to be 
mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in 
Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending 
me to try and patch it up I could have 
got him promoted there to be the manager he gave 
me a great mirada once or twice first he was 
as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom 
only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress 
that I lost the leads out of the tails with 
no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again 
I bought it simply to please him I knew it 
was no good by the finish pity I changed my 
mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said 
and not Lees it was just like the shop itself 
rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich 
shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only 
he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans 
dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the 
shelves into it if I went by his advices every 
blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes 
take that thats alright the one like a wedding cake 
standing up miles off my head he said suited me 
or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on 
pins and needles about the shop girl in that place 
in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him 
into and she as insolent as ever she could be 
with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too 
much trouble whats she there for but I stared it 
out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no 
wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy 
pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see 
him looking very hard at my chest when he stood 
up to open the door for me it was nice
