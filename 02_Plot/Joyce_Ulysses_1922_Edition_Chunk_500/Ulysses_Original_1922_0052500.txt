the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently two, then 
all, from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel. 
Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery 
crumb from his hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live 
on fishy flesh they have to, all sea birds, gulls, 
seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to 
preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is 
swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them. They wheeled, 
flapping weakly. I’m not going to throw any more. Penny 
quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a 
caw. They spread foot and mouth disease too. If you 
cram a turkey, say, on chestnut meal it tastes like

don’t believe it. He wouldn’t surely? No, no. Mr Bloom 
moved forward raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about 
that. After one. Time ball on the ballast office is 
down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of Sir 
Robert Ball’s. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There’s a priest. 
Could ask him. Par it’s Greek : parallel, parallax. Met
