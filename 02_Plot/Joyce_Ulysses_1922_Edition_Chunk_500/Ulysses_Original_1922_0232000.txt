way : the chariot of David : the annular cinctures 
of Saturn : the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns 
: the interdependant gyrations of double suns : the independent 
synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, 
Galle : the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of 
cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution : 
the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast 
elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion : 
the sidereal origin of meteoric stones : the Libyan floods 
on Mars about the period of the birth of the 
younger satroscopist : the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about 
the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 
August) : the monthly recurrence known as the new moon 
with the old moon in her arms : the posited 
influence of celestial on human bodies : the appearance of 
a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night 
and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision 
and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the 
period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in 
the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star 
(2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had 
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona 
Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom 
and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had 
(effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation 
of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen 
Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some 
years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, 
and in and from other constellations some years before or 
after the birth or death of other persons, the attendant 
phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, 
abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, 
emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, 
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings. His (Bloomâ€™s) 
logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible 
error? That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, 
not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a 
Utopia, there being no known method from the known to 
the unknown : an infinity, renderable equally finite by the 
suppositious probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of 
the same and of different magnitudes : a mobility of 
illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air : a 
past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present 
before its spectators had entered actual present existence. Was he 
more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? Indubitably 
in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the 
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement 
of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of 
the satellite of their planet. Did he then accept as 
an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon
