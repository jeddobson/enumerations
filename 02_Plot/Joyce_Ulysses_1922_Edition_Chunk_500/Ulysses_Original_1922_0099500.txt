romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy’s 
own Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. 
The lovely name you. Low sank the music, air and 
words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his 
cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. 
The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap. Tap. Tap. Thrilled, 
she listened, bending in sympathy to hear. Blank face. Virgin 
should say : or fingered only. Write something on it 
: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. 
Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. 
Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow 
gentle. Loud. Three holes all women. Goddess I didn’t see. 
They want it : not too much polite. That’s why 
he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your 
face. With look to look : songs without words. Molly 
that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was 
sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too 
that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature. Ventriloquise. My lips 
closed. Think in my stom. What? Will? You? I. Want. 
You. To. With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed. Swelling 
in apoplectic bitch’s bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. 
One hour’s your time to live, your last. Tap. Tap. 
Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear 
for martyrs. For all things dying, want to, dying to, 
die. For that all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope 
she’s over. Because their wombs. A liquid of womb of 
woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. 
See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. 
On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave 
(her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly, sank red rose. 
Heartbeats her breath : breath that is life. And all 
the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair. But look. The 
bright stars fade. O rose! Castille. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. 
For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See 
her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks 
of empties. On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand 
lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in 
pity for croppy. Fro, to : to, fro : over 
the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her 
eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity : passed, 
repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, 
a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding 
ring. With a cock with a carra. Tap. Tap. Tap. 
I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors 
swing. The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to 
be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. 
Where’s my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. 
Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, 
walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell, 
Waaaaaaalk. Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup.
