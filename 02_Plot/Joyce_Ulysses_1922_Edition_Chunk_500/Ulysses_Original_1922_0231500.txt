cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and 
mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa : of the 
incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained 
by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead : 
of the universe of human serum constellated with red and 
white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other 
bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies 
of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible 
component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division 
till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere 
was never reached. Why did he not elaborate these calculations 
to a more precise result? Because some years previously in 
1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of 
the circle he had learned of the existence of a 
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be 
of such magnitude and of so many places, e. g., 
the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, 
the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 
1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India 
paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain 
the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, 
hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens 
of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the 
nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the 
potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of 
any power of any of its powers. Did he find 
the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their 
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the 
possible social and moral redemption of said race by a 
redeemer, easier of solution? Of a different order of difficulty. 
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an 
atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable 
altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of 
intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and 
statosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, 
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as 
a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that 
a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings 
might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian 
or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity 
of beings created in varying forms wiih finite différences resulting 
similar to the whole and to one another would probably 
there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, 
to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity. And 
the problem of possible redemption? The minor was proved by 
the major. Which various features of the constellations were in 
turn considered? The various colours significant of various degrees of 
vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar) : their degrees of 
brilliancy : their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 
7th : their positions : the waggoner’s star : Walsingham
