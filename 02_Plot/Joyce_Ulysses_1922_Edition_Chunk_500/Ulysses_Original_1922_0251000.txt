sure you cant get on in this world without style 
all going in food and rent when I get it 
Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style 
I always want to throw a handful of tea into 
the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair 
of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes 
yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all 
the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the 
one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman 
cutting up this old hat and patching up the other 
the men wont look at you and women try to 
walk on you because they know youve no man then 
with all the things getting dearer every day for the 
4 years more I have of life up to 35 
no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 
in September will I what O well look at that 
Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her 
when I was out last week her beautys on the 
wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair 
on her down to her waist tossing it back like 
that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street ist thing I 
did every morning to look across see her combing it 
as if she loved it and was full of it 
pity I only got to know her the day before 
we left and that Mrs Langtry the Jersey Lily the 
prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes 
like the first man going the roads only for the 
name of a king theyre all made the one way 
only a black mans Id like to try a beauty 
up to what was she 45 there was some funny 
story about the jealous old husband what was it at 
all and an oyster knife he went no he made 
her wear a kind of a tin thing around her 
and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster 
knife cant be true a thing like that like some 
of those books he brings me the works of Master 
Francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child 
born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out 
a nice word for any priest to write and her 
a â€” e as if any fool wouldnt know what 
that meant I hate that pretending of all things with 
the old blackguards face on him anybody can see its 
not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought 
me that twice I remember when I came to page 
50 the part about where she hangs him up out 
of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing 
for a woman in that all invention made up about 
he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the 
ball was over like the infant Jesus In the crib 
at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman
