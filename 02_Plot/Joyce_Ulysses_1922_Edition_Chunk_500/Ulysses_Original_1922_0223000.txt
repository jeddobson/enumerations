other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse 
being had to the impotable water of the Grand and 
Royal canals as in 1893) particulary as the South Dublin 
Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per 
pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted 
of a wastage of 20.000 gallons per night by a 
reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law 
agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting 
to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting 
taxpayers, solvent, sound. What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer 
of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire? Its universality 
: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in 
seeking its own level : its vastness in the ocean 
of Mercatorâ€™s projection : its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam 
trench of the Pacific exceeding 8.000 fathoms : the restlessness 
of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all 
points of its seaboard : the independence of its units 
: the variability of states of sea : its hydrostatic 
quiescence in calm : its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and 
spring tides : its subsidence after devastation : its sterility 
in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic : its climatic 
and commercial significance : its preponderance of 3 to 1 
over the dry land of the globe : its indisputable 
hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below 
the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn : the multisecular stability of 
its primeval basin : its luteosfulvous bed : its capacity 
to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including 
billions of tons of the most precious metals : its 
slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories : its alluvial 
deposits : its weight and volume and density : its 
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns : its gradation of 
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones : 
its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing 
rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents : gulfstream, north 
and south equatorial courses : its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, 
Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, 
geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts : its vast 
circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve : its secrecy in springs, and latent 
humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by 
the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of 
air, distillation of dew : the simplicity of its composition, 
two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of 
oxygen : its healing virtues : its buoyancy in the 
waters of the Dead Sea : its persevering penetrativeness in 
runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard : its properties 
for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation : its 
infaillibility as paradigm and paragon : its metamorphoses as vapour, 
mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail : its strength in 
rigid hydrants : its variety of forms in loughs and 
bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and
