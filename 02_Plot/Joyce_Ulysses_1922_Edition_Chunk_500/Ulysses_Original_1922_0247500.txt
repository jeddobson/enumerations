downright villain to go and do a thing like that

so bad as all that comes to yes because they 
cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in

Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed 
at once even before he was introduced when I was 
in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying 
to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 
2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him 
looking with his two old maids of sisters when I 
stood up and asked the girl where it was what 
do I care with it dropping out of me and 
that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you 
half an hour to let them down wetting all myself 
always with some brandnew fad every other week such a 
long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on 
the seat behind that I never got after some robber 
of a woman and he wanted me to put it

and I saw his eyes on my feet going out 
through the turning door he was looking when I looked 
back and I went there for tea 2 days after 
in the hope but he wasnt now how did that 
excite him because I was crossing them when we were 
in the other room first he meant the shoes that 
are too tight to walk in my hand is nice

stone for my mouth a nice aquamarine Ill stick him 
for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my 
foot so much still I made him spend once with 
my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert 
so cold and windy it was well we had that 
rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt 
black out when he asked to take off my stockings 
lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street well and another 
time it was my muddy boots hed like me to
