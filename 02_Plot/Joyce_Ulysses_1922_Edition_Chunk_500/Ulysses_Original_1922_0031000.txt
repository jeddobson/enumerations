above the clatter of the wheels. — I won’t have 
her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s 
son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not 
likely. He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache 
to Mr Power’s mild face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and 
beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. 
He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy 
had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in 
the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My 
son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. 
From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning 
in Raymond terrace she was at the window, watching the 
two dogs at it by the wall of the cease 
to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had 
that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. 
Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I’m dying for it. 
How life begins. Got big then. Had to refuse the 
Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped 
him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn 
German too. — Are we late? Mr Power asked. — 
Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch. Molly. 
Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping 
Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear 
girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student.

said. — He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t 
that squint troubling him. Do you follow me? He closed 
his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs 
from under his thighs. — What is this? he said, 
in the name of God? Crumbs? — Someone seems to 
have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power 
said. All raised their thighs, eyed with disfavour the mildewed 
buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, 
frowned downward and said : — Unless I’m greatly mistaken. 
What do you think, Martin? — It struck me too, 
Martin Cunningham said. Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad 
I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But 
I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better. Mr 
Dedalus sighed resignedly. — After all, he said, it’s the 
most natural thing in the world. — Did Tom Kernan 
turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his 
beard gently. — Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with 
Ned Lambert and Hynes. — And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr 
Power asked. — At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said. — 
I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said 
he’d try to come. The carriage halted short. — What’s

put his head out of the window. — The grand
