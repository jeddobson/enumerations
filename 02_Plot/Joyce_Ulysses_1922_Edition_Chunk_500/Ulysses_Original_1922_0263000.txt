he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece 
he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife 
and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im 
sorry in a way for him what are his wife 
and 5 children going to do unless he was insured 
comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner 
and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you 
please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance 
theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodloking what men wasnt 
he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben 
Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to 
sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into 
them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like 
a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks 
sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the 
stage imagine paying 5/– in the preserved seats for that 
to see him and Simon Dedalus too he was always 
turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the 
old love is the new was one of his so 
sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was 
always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with 
him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious 
glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart he always sang it 
not like Bartell D’Arcy sweet tart goodbye of course he 
had the gift of the voice so there was no 
art in it all over you like a warm showerbath 
O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was 
a bit too high for my register even transposed and 
he was married at the time to May Goulding but 
then hed say or do something to knock the good 
out of it hes a widower now I wonder what 
sort is his son he says hes an author and 
going to be a university professor of Italian and Im 
to take lessons what is he driving at now showing 
him my photo its not good of me I ought 
to have got it taken in drapery that never looks 
out of fashion still I look young in it I 
wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether 
and me too after all why not I saw him 
driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and 
mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now 
yes hed be 11 though what was the good in 
going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor 
the other of course he insisted hed go into mourning 
for the cat I suppose hes a man now by 
this time he was an innocent boy then and a 
darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly 
hair like a prince on the stage when I saw 
him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember 
they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold
