of him to show me out in any case Im 
extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too 
marked the first time after him being insulted and me 
being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled 
I know my chest was out that way at the 
door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure 
you were yes I think he made them a bit 
firmer sucking them like that so long he made me 
thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes 
this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least 
thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill 
take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out 
for him what are all those veins and things curious 
the way its made 2 the same in case of 
twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like 
those statues in the museum one of them pretending to 
hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of 
course compared with what a man looks like with his 
two bags full and his other thing hanging down out 
of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack 
no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf the woman 
is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I 
could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow 
in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys 
and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the 
coffee palace would I be like that bath of the 
nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or 
Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish 
photo he has the nymphs used they go about like 
that I asked him that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the 
meat market or that other wretch with the red head 
behind the tree where the statue of the fish used 
to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing 
standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes 
up to one side the Queens own they were a 
nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always 
trying to show it to you every time nearly I 
passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station 
just to try some fellow or other trying to catch 
my eye or if it was 1 of the 7 
wonders of the world O and the stink of those 
rotten places the night coming home with of those rotten 
places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords 
party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and 
watery I went into 1 of them it was so 
biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 
the canal was frozen yes it was a few months 
after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there 
to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I 
tried to draw a picture of it before I tore
