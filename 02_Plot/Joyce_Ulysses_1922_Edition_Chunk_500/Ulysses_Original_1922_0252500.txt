it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre 
not afraid going about of getting a kick or a 
bang or something there and that word met something with 
hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers 
about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply 
the way a body can understand then he goes and 
burns the bottom out of the pan all for his 
Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of 
his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple 
I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to 
hurt you I had a great breast of milk with 
Milly enough for two what was the reason of that 
he said I could have got a pound a week 
as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that 
delicate looking student that stopped in nÂ° 28 with the 
Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only 
for I snapped up the towel to my face that 
was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her 
till he got doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna 
prescription I had to get him to suck them they 
were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker 
than cows then he wanted to milk me into the 
tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to 
put him in the budget if I only could remember 
the one half of the things and write a book 
out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and 
its so much smoother the skin much an hour he 
was at them Im sure by the clock like some 
kind of a big infant I had at me they 
want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men 
get out of a woman I can feel his mouth 
O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was 
here or somebody to let myself go with and come 
again like that I feel all fire inside me or 
if I could dream it when he made me spend 
the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I 
was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round 
him I had to hug him after O Lord I 
wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or 
shit or anything at all only not to look ugly 
or those lines ftom the strain who knows the way 
hed take it you want to feel your way with 
a man theyre not all like him thank God some 
ofthem want you to be so nice about it I 
noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I 
gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit 
loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips 
up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday 
two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday 
frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in
