coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck 
he had been keeping away from the house he felt 
it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned 
and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till 
I took off my glove slowly watching him he said 
my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything
