table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered 
by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna. What 
caused him consolation in his sitting posture? The candour, nudity, 
pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect 
in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus 
purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk. 
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? Inhibitory pressure 
of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles 
of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and 
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion. How was the 
irritation allayed? He removed his collar, with contained black necktie 
and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on 
the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed 
direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line 
of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from 
the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and 
umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the 
intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways 
at right angles and terminating in circles described about two 
equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the 
mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one 
braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete. 
What involuntary actions followed? He compressed between 2 fingers the 
flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region 
below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks 
and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. 
He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of 
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly 
abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left 
lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a 
silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion 
(10 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, 
Sydney Parade. Compile the budget for 16 June 1904. Debit
