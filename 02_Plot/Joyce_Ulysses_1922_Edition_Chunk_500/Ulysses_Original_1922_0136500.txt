dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only 
now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but 
sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains 
blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese 
this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it 
is. It’s like a fine fine veil or web they 
have all over the skin, fine like what do you 
call it gossamer and they’re aways spinning it out of 
them, fine as anything, rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings 
to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm 
shoe. Stays. Drawers : little kick, taking them off. Byby 
till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in 
her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a 
thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder 
where it is really. There or the armpits or under 
the neck. Because you get it out of all holes 
and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil or ether or 
something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails one grain pour off 
odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. 
Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank 
you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it 
that way. We’re the same. Some women for instance warn 
you off when they have their period. Come near. Then 
get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like 
what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off 
the grass. Perhaps they get a man smell off us. 
What though? Cigary gloves Long John had on his desk 
the other. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. 
No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because 
priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz 
round it like flies round treacle. Railed off the altar 
get on to it at any cost. The tree of 
forbidden priest. O father, will you? Let me be the 
first to. That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. 
Source of life and it’s extremely curious the smell. Celery 
sauce. Let me. Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into 
the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons 
it is. Ah, no, that’s the soap. O by the 
by that lotion. I knew there was something on my 
mind. Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike 
carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Hynes might have 
paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher’s just 
to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two 
and nine. Bad opinion of me he’ll have. Call tomorrow. 
How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two 
and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another 
time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellow run 
up a bill on the slate and then slinking around 
the back streets into somewhere else. Here’s this nobleman passed 
before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far
