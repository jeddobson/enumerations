R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of 
Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas 
Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl? Firstly, oscillation 
between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipatep 
diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and 
the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market : 
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions 
of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke 
and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King 
Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and 
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric 
Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins 
Street : fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s 
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by 
Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical 
underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles : 
fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and 
humorous allusions from Everybody’s Book of Jokes (1000 pages and 
a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and 
cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, 
Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the 
new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton. What relation existed between their 
ages? 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of 
Stephen’s present age Stephen was 6. 16 years after in 
1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom 
would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 
and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 
16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according arbitrary 
as future years were added for if the proportion existing 
in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, 
till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 
374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as 
Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 
when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 
70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in 
the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the 
maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if 
Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that 
age in the year 3072 A. D., Bloom would have 
been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been 
obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B. 
C. What events might nullify these calculations? The cessation of 
existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new 
era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent 
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. How many 
previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? Two. The first in 
the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house. Medina Villa, Kimmage road, 
Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen 
being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to
