wallflower that was why we had the standup row over 
politics he began it not me when he said about 
Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me 
cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything 
I was fuming with myself after for giving in only 
for I knew he was gone on me and the 
first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so 
much I couldnt put him into a temper still he 
knows a lot of mixed up things especially about the 
body and the insides I often wanted to study up 
that myself what we have inside us in that family 
physician I could always hear his voice talking when the 
room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended 
I had on a coolness with her over him mass 
or meeting he says your soul you have no soul 
inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it 
is to have one yes when I lit the lamp 
yes because he must have come 3 or 4 times 
with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he 
has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they 
call it was going to because he used to be 
a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who 
are you going to and I aid over to Floey 
and he made me the present of lord Byrons poems 
and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that 
I could quite easily get him to make it up 
any time I know how Id even supposing he got 
in with her again and was going out to see 
her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the 
onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck 
down the collar of my blouse or touch him with 
my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then 
wouldsend them all spinning however alright well see then let 
him go to her she of course would only be 
too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him 
that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to 
her and ask her do you love him and look 
her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but 
he might imagine he was and make a declaration with 
his plabbery kind of a manner to her like he 
did to me though I had the devils own job 
to get it out of him though I liked him 
for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt 
to be got for the asking he was on the 
pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen 
I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want 
to say to you only for I put him off 
letting on I was in a temper with my hands 
and arms full of pasty flour in any case I 
let out too much the night before talking of dreams
