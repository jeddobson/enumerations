too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of 
the west and of the east the lofty trees wave 
in different directions their first class foliage, the wafty sycamore, 
the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and 
other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region 
is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity 
to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most 
lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely 
objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of 
herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems 
and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo 
them, from Elbana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered 
Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek 
Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid 
and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons 
of kings. And there rises a shining palace whose crystal 
glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive 
sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither 
come all herds and fatlings and first fruits of that 
land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain 
descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison

of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York

and pumets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches 
and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet 
sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries 
and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit 
for princes and raspberries from their canes. I dare him, 
says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, 
you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that 
way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes 
and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium 
steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and 
storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and 
baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine 
and Angus heifers and polly bullocks of immaculate pedigree together 
with prime premiated milchcows and beeves : and there is 
ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, 
grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine 
from pasturelands of Lush and Rush and Carrickmines and from 
the streamy vales of Thomond, from M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible 
and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities 
of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders 
distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and 
rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb 
and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs, in great hundreds,
