Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and 
what do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there 
in Conway’s we were. Doran, Lyons in Conway’s. She raised 
a gloved hand to her hair. In came Hoppy. Having 
a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from 
beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin 
shine in the glare, the braided drums. Clearly I can 
see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Talking of 
one thing or another. Lady’s hand. Which side will she 
get up? — And he said : Sad thing about 
our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? I said. Poor little 
Paddy Dignam, he said. Off to the country : Broadstone 
probably. High brown boots with laces dangling. Well turned foot. 
What is he fostering over that change for? Sees me 
looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two 
strings to her bow. — Why? I said. What’s wrong 
with him? I said. Proud : rich : silk stockings. 
— Yes, Mr Bloom said. He moved a little to 
the side of M’Coy’s talking head. Getting up in a 
minute. — What’s wrong with him, he said. He’s dead,

the display of. Esprit de corps. Well, what are you 
gaping at? — Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a 
dull sigh. Another gone. — One of the best, M’Coy 
said. The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop 
Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. 
Flicker, flicker : the laceflare of her hat in the 
sun : flicker, flick. — Wife well, I suppose? M’Coy’s 
changed voice said. — O yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, 
thanks. He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly 
: What is home without Plumtree’s Potted Meat? Incomplete. With 
it an abode of bliss. — My missus has just 
got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet. Valise 
tack again. By the way no harm. I’m off that, 
thanks. Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness 
: — My wife too, he said. She’s going to 
sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster hall, Belfast, 
on the twentyfifth. — That so? M’Coy said. Glad to 
hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up? Mrs Marion
