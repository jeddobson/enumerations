he not long married flirting with a young girl at 
Pooles Myriorana and turned my back on him when he 
slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had 
the impudence to make up to me one time well 
done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of 
all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called 
a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle 
in bed or else if its not that its some 
little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or 
picked up on the sly if they only knew him 
as well as I do yes because the day before 
yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came 
into the front room for the matches to show him 
Dignams death in the paper as if something told me 
and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to 
be thinking about business so very probably that was it 
to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him 
because all men get a bit like that at his 
age especially getting on to forty he is now so 
as to wheedle any money she can out of him 
no fool like an old fool and then the usual 
kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I 
care two straws who he does it with or knew 
before that way though Id like to find out so 
long as I dont have the two of them under 
my nose all the time like that slut that Mary 
we had in Ontario Terrace padding out her false bottom 
to excite him bad enough to get the smell of 
those painted women off him once or twice I had 
a suspicion by getting him to come near me when 
I found the long hair on his coat without that 
one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was 
drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it 
was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing 
that she could eat at our table on Christmas if 
you please O no thank you not in my house 
stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going 
out to see her aunt if you please common robbery 
so it was but I was sure he had something 
on with that one it takes me to find out 
a thing like that he said you have no proof 
it was her proof O yes her aunt was very 
fond of oysters but I told her what I thought 
of her suggesting me to go out to be alone 
with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them 
the garters I found in her room the Friday she 
was out that was enough for me a little bit 
too much I saw too that her face swelled up 
on her with temper when I gave her her weeks 
notice better do without them altogether do out the rooms
